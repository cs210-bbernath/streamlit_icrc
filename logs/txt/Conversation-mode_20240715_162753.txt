 - How may I assist you today?
User:
 - I have little bit of a facial paralysis and a localized rash.
Assistant:
 - I'm sorry to hear that. When did you first notice these symptoms?
User:
 - 2 days ago
Assistant:
 - Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort in your face or head?
User:
 - Half of my face is a little paralyzed. I also have severe joint pain
Assistant:
 - Can you tell me more about the joint pain? Which joints are affected and how severe is the pain?
User:
 - The pain is high and it's my shoulders
Assistant:
 - Can you tell me more about the rash? Where is it located and what does it look like?
User:
 - The rash is located at the top of my back, and looks like a red circle
Assistant:
 - Based on your symptoms, it sounds like you may have Lyme disease. This is a bacterial infection that is transmitted through tick bites. The red circle on your back is likely the classic "bullseye" rash that is often associated with Lyme disease. I strongly recommend that you seek medical attention as soon as possible to get a proper diagnosis and treatment. Lyme disease can have serious complications if left untreated, so it's important to get treatment right away.
