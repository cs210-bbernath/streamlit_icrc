 - My patient has a fever
Assistant:
 - I'm sorry to hear that. A fever can be a symptom of various conditions, ranging from mild to severe. To better understand the situation, can you please tell me:

1. What is your patient's temperature? Is it mild (less than 102°F/39°C), moderate (102°F-104°F/39°C-40°C), or high (above 104°F/40°C)?

2. How long has your patient had the fever? Is it a new onset or has it been persistent over several days?

3. Are there any other symptoms accompanying the fever, such as headache, body aches, fatigue, cough, sore throat, or nausea/vomiting?

4. Has your patient recently traveled to any areas with known outbreaks or been exposed to anyone with a similar illness?

5. Does your patient have any underlying medical conditions, such as a weakened immune system, diabetes, or heart disease?

Please provide me with more information so I can help you better assess the situation and provide guidance on the next steps.
