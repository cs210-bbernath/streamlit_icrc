     -Sorry to hear that. Can you tell me if the facial paralysis is on one side of your face or both?

User:
     -It only on the left side of my face.

User:
     -No history, no recent infections

Assistant:
     -Are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as difficulty swallowing, numbness or tingling, or changes in taste or hearing?

User:
     -I do have arthritis with severe joint pain and swelling

Assistant:
     -Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as fatigue, fever, or weight loss?

User:
     -A little fever yes

Assistant:
     -Do you have any history of tick bites or contact with ticks recently?

User:
     -I have been camping in the forest for the last 1 days, so I would say yes

Assistant:
     -It's possible that you might have Lyme disease, which is caused by a tick bite and can cause facial paralysis, joint pain, and a rash. I recommend seeing a healthcare provider as soon as possible for a blood test to confirm the diagnosis. In the meantime, it's important to rest and avoid strenuous activities. If your symptoms worsen, seek medical attention immediately.
