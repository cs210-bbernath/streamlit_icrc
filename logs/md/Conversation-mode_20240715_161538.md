Based on your symptoms, it sounds like you may be experiencing a respiratory infection, possibly related to tuberculosis (TB). Given your recent travel to Nigeria, which is a country with a high incidence of TB, it's important that we investigate this further. Have you been exposed to anyone with TB recently or in the past?
