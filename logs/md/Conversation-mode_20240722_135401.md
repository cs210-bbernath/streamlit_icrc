**Stopping Bleeding from External Injuries**

If you or someone you know is bleeding from an external injury, it's essential to act quickly and appropriately to control the bleeding and prevent further harm. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you stop bleeding from external injuries:

**Assess the Situation**

1. **Call for Help**: If the injury is severe or you're unsure of what to do, call emergency services (911 in the USA or your local emergency number) immediately.
2. **Check for Danger**: Ensure the person is in a safe location, away from any hazards.

**Control Bleeding**

1. **Apply Pressure**: Use a clean cloth or gauze to apply firm, steady pressure to the wound. Pressure should be applied directly to the bleeding site.
2. **Elevate the Affected Area**: If the injury is on an arm or leg, elevate it above heart level to reduce blood flow to the area.
3. **Apply a Tourniquet (if necessary)**: If the bleeding is severe and you have proper training, apply a tourniquet between the heart and the wound. However, this should only be done as a last resort and with proper training.
4. **Use Hemostatic Agents (if available)**: Hemostatic agents, like QuikClot or Celox, can help promote clotting and stop bleeding. Follow the product's instructions for use.

**Additional Tips**

1. **Avoid Direct Pressure on the Wound**: Don't press directly on the wound with your bare hands, as this can push bacteria and other contaminants into the wound.
2. **Don't Remove Embedded Objects**: If an object is embedded in the wound, don't remove it. Instead, apply pressure around the object to control bleeding.
3. **Monitor and Maintain Pressure**: Continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops or medical help arrives.
4. **Stay Calm and Comfort the Person**: Reassure the person and try to keep them calm until medical help arrives.

**When to Seek Medical Attention**

1. **Severe Bleeding**: If the bleeding is rapid, heavy, or doesn't stop after 10-15 minutes of pressure.
2. **Deep or Large Wounds**: If the wound is deep, large, or has jagged edges.
3. **Injury to the Head, Neck, or Face**: If the injury is to the head, neck, or face, as these areas are more prone to serious complications.
4. **Shock or
