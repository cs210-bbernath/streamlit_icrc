Can you tell me more about the rash? Where is it located and what does it look like?

### User:

<div style="background-color: #F4DDA8; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">

### Assistant:

Based on your symptoms, it sounds like you may have Lyme disease. This is a bacterial infection that is transmitted through tick bites. The red circle on your back is likely the classic "bullseye" rash that is often associated with Lyme disease. I strongly recommend that you seek medical attention as soon as possible to get a proper diagnosis and treatment. Lyme disease can have serious complications if left untreated, so it's important to get treatment right away.
