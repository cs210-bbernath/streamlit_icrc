For blood transfusion: Determine the patient’s blood type; Select potential donors for possible transfusion of fresh whole blood; If transferred, the woman should be accompanied by family members who are potential blood donors; If there is moderate bleeding and no clotting disorder, transfuse packed red blood cells or whole blood;  If there is massive bleeding and/or a clotting disorder, transfuse fresh whole blood (drawn less than 4 hours and unrefrigerated) or packed red blood cells or whole blood combined with fresh frozen plasma; . Blood or other blood products must have been screened (HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and malaria in endemic areas).

A sub-umbilical midline incision is preferable (better exposure), sometimes with peri-umbilical extension. The tear is usually in the lower segment, anterior and low. Enlarge the tear to allow extraction of the foetus. Check the integrity of the bladder, which may have been injured if it is very adherent to the lower uterine segment (continuous suture in one or two planes and urinary catheterisation for at least 7 days). Attempt repair whenever possible. Before suturing the uterine muscle, trim ragged, bruised edges. In the event of uterine infection or extensive rupture with severe bruising around the wound or suture repair is not possible, perform a subtotal hysterectomy with ovarian conservation.

Ensure a calm reassuring environment and provide the woman as much privacy as possible during examinations and delivery. Encourage her to move about freely if desired and to have a person of her choice to accompany her. Anticipate the need for resuscitation at every birth. The necessary equipment should be ready at hand and ready for use."}

And Onset of uterine contractions: intermittent, rhythmic pains accompanied by a hardening of the uterus, progressively increasing in strength and frequency; Cervical changes: progressive shortening (effacement) and dilation (Figure 5.1): in a primipara, the cervix will first efface then, dilate; ם  in a multipara, effacement and dilation occur simultaneously. a Repeated contractions without cervical changes should not be considered as the start of labour. Repeated contractions that are ineffective (unaccompanied by cervical changes) and irregular, which spontaneously stop and then possibly start up again, represent false labour. In this case, do not rupture the membranes, do not administer oxytocin. Likewise, cervical dilation with few or no contractions should not be considered the start of labour. Multiparous women in particular may have a dilated cervix (up to 5 cm) at term before the onset of labour. If in doubt, in both cases, re-examine 4 hours later. If the cervix has not changed labour has not begun and the woman does not need to be admitted to the delivery room."}

Position changes and walking around help relieve the pain, enhances the progress of labour and helps foetal descent. Pain can also be relieved by massage or hot or cold compresses. Midwife support helps manage pain. Routinely insert an IV line in the following situations: excessively large uterus (foetal macrosomia, multiple pregnancy or polyhydramnios), known anaemia and hypertension. Page 87 / 279"}
{"text": "\n## Foetal heart rate\n\n \n## Foetal heart rate monitoring\n\n Use a Pinard stethoscope or foetal Doppler, every 30 minutes during the active phase and every 5 minutes during active second stage, or as often as possible. Listen to and count for at least one whole minute immediately after the contraction. Normal foetal heart rate is 110 to 160 beats per minute. The foetal heart rate may slow down during a contraction. If it becomes completely normal again as soon as the uterus relaxes, there is probably no foetal distress. If the foetal heart rate heard immediately after the end of a contraction is abnormal (less than 100 beats per minute or more than 180 beats per minute), continue foetal heart rate monitoring for the next 3 contractions to confirm the abnormality."}
{"text": "\n## Management of abnormal foetal heart rate\n\n \n## In all cases:\n\n Insert an IV line. Check maternal vital signs: heart rate, blood pressure and temperature. d Check the uterine tonus. If hypertonic, look for excessive administration of oxytocin (which a should therefore be stopped) or placental abruption (Chapter 3, Section 3.2 ). a Check the colour of the amniotic fluid: meconium-stained (greenish) amniotic fluid combined with foetal heart rate abnormalities is suggestive of true foetal distress. If the foetal heart rate is less than 100 beats/minute: Stop administering oxytocin if  an infusion is in progress. d ם Check for vaginal bleeding: bleeding may suggest placental abruption or uterine rupture. Raise the patient or place her on her left side. Laying on her back the uterus creates pressure on d the vena cava, which may be the cause of low foetal heart rate. d Correct possible hypotension by fluid replacement (Ringer lactate) to bring the systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg. Perform a vaginal examination to look for cord prolapse. a If the foetal heart rate is more than 180 beats/minute: The most common cause is maternal febrile infection. Look for the cause of the infection (uterine infection, pyelonephritis, malaria, etc.) and treat. Treat the fever (paracetamol). d Treat the fever (paracetamol). In case of fever of unknown origin, administer antibiotics as for a prolonged rupture of d membranes (Chapter 4, Section 4.9).

{"text": "\n## Amniotic sac\n\n The amniotic sac bulges during contractions and usually breaks spontaneously after 5 cm of dilation or at full dilation during delivery. Immediately after rupture, check the foetal heart rate and if necessary perform a vaginal examination in order to identify a potential prolapse of the umbilical cord ( Section 5.4 ). Once the membranes are ruptured, always use sterile gloves for vaginal examination. Note the colour of the amniotic fluid: clear, blood-stained, or meconium-stained. Meconium staining by itself, without abnormal foetal heart rate, is not diagnostic of foetal distress, but does require closer monitoring — in particular, a vaginal examination every 2 hours. Action must be taken if dilation fails to progress after 2 hours."}
{"text": "\n## Foetal progress\n\n . Assess foetal descent by palpating the abdomen (portion of the foetal head felt above the symphysis pubis) before performing the vaginal examination. At each vaginal examination, in addition to dilation, check the presentation, the position and the degree of foetal descent. Look for signs that the foetal head is engaged: On vaginal examination, the presenting part prevents the examiner's fingers from reaching the sacral concavity (Figures 5.3a and 5.3b). The presence of caput (benign diffuse swelling of the foetal head) can lead to the mistaken conclusion that the foetal head is engaged. The distance between the foetal shoulder and the upper edge of the symphysis pubis is less than 2 finger widths (Figures 5.3c and 5.3d). Page 89 / 279 Figures 5.3 - Diagnosing engagement 5.3a - Presenting part not engaged: fingers in the vagina can reach the sacral concavity 5.3b - Presenting part engaged: fingers in the vagina cannot reach the sacral concavity (if caput absent) ( G ( 3 ) (3) ( C 5.3c - Head not engaged: the shoulder is more than 2 finger widths above the symphysis 5.3d - Head engaged: the shoulder is less than 2 finger widths above the symphysis Use reference points on the foetal skull to determine the position of the head in the mother's . pelvis. It is easier to determine the position of the head after the membranes have ruptured, and the cervix is more than 5 cm dilated. When the head is well flexed, the anterior (diamond-shaped) fontanelle is not palpable; only the sagittal suture and the posterior (triangular) fontanelle are. The posterior fontanelle is the landmark for the foetal occiput, and thus helps give the foetal position. In most cases, once the head is engaged, rotation of the head within the pelvis brings the foetal occiput under the mother's symphysis, with the posterior fontanelle along the anterior midline.

It should not, however, take longer than 2 hours in a multipara and 3 hours in a primipara lf there is a traditional delivery position and no specific risk for the mother or child has been established, it is possible to assist a delivery in a woman on her back, on her left side, squatting or on all fours (Figures 5.4). 5.4a: Lying on left side 5.4b: Lying on back Figures 5.4 - Delivery position Rinse the vulva and perineum with clean water. . The bladder should be emptied, naturally if possible. In cases of urinary retention only, insert a . urinary catheter using sterile technique (sterile gloves; sterile, single use catheter). . If labour is progressing well and there is no foetal heart rate abnormality, let the woman follow her own urge to push. In other cases, expulsive effort should be directed. The woman should push during the uterine contraction. Pushing may be done either with held breath (after a deep inhalation, glottis closed, abdominal muscles and diaphragm contracted, directed toward the perineum) or with exhalation. Expulsive effort is maintained for long as possible: in general, 2 to 3 pushes per cntraction. Between contractions, the woman should rest and breathe deeply. The birth attendant should . monitor the foetal heart rate after each contraction. The head begins to stretch the perineum, which becomes progressively thinner; the vaginal opening . distends, the labia spread apart, and the occiput appears. In a cephalic presentation, the head usually emerges occiput anterior: the infant is born looking down, the occiput pivoting against the symphysis (Figures 5.5). The head goes into slight extension. The birth attendant must guide this motion and prevent any abrupt expulsive movement, with one hand supporting the occiput. The other hand can support the chin through the perineum. Cover the anal area with a compress (Figures 5.6). Page 91 / 279 Figures 5.5 - The different stages of occiput-anterior delivery Figures 5.6 - Progressive delivery of the head efforts and breathe deeply. With one hand, the birth attendant controls the extension of the head and moves it slightly side-to-side, in order to gradually free the parietal protuberances; if necessary (not routinely), the chin can be lifted with the other hand (Figure 5.7). Page 92 / 279 Figure 5.7 - Bringing the perineum under the chin At the moment of delivery, the perineum is extremely distended. Controlling the expulsion can help reduce the risk of a tear. Episiotomy ( Section 5.8 ) is not routinely indicated. In an occiput-posterior delivery (Figure 5.8), where perineal distension is at a maximum, episiotomy may be helpful. Figure 5.8 - Occiput-posterior delivery . The head, once delivered, rotates spontaneously by at least 90°. The birth attendant helps this . movement by grasping the head in both hands and exerting gentle downward traction to bring the anterior shoulder under the symphysis and then deliver it then, smooth upward traction to deliver the posterior shoulder (Figures 5.9). To reduce the risk of perineal tears, control the delivery of the posterior shoulder.

With one hand holding the cup, circle the cup with one finger of the other hand to make sure that no . vaginal or cervical tissue is caught under it. Applying traction can tear the cervix or vagina if there is vacuum extractor suction on those tissues (risk of massive haemorrhage). Figures 5.15 - Inserting the cup into the vagina . If required have an assistant connect the cup to the vacuum system. Hold the cup to the foetus' head with one hand. Pump to reach a negative pressure. Check for trapped vaginal or cervical tissue before starting traction. Sit on a small foot rest or kneel; this gives a good traction angle and helps to stay balanced. The traction, applied with the dominant hand, should be perpendicular to the plane of the cup. Traction should be applied in sync with the uterine contractions and the pushing, which the woman should continue. Stop pulling the moment the uterine contraction stops. The direction of traction varies according to the head's progress: first downward, then horizontal, then increasingly vertical (Figures 5.16). Page 104/ 279 Figures 5.16 - Vacuum extractor traction: axis varies depending on the progress of the head If the cup is positioned incorrectly or the traction is too sudden, the cup can detach. If this happens, re-apply it (but no more than 3 times). . When the hand is able grasp the foetus' chin, turn off the suction, remove the vacuum extractor and finish the delivery in the normal fashion. While episiotomy is not routine, it can be useful, especially if the perineum is too resistant. Note: when there is a significant pre-existing caput, application of the vacuum extractor can be ineffective and forceps may be necessary. Do not apply suction for more than 20 minutes: the indication is probably incorrect, and there is a risk of scalp necrosis. Birth usually occurs in less than 15 minutes.

{"text": "\n## 5.8.1 Indications\n\n Episiotomy can cause infection, haemorrhage and/or chronic pain. It should not be done routinely. Simple first- and second-degree tears heal as well or better than an episiotomy. Episiotomy should be routinely performed in case of symphysiotomy. Episiotomy should be considered in the following situations:  Prolonged delivery, especially if foetal heart rate slows, when completion of the delivery is being obstructed by the perineum. Instrumental delivery (forceps or vacuum extraction). Shoulder dystocia. Occiput posterior, face, or breech delivery. Oedematous or scarred perineum that does not stretch properly. History of third and fourth degree tears. Excision (clitoral circumcision with partial or total clitoridectomy, often with removal of the labia minora). Excision causes a loss of perineal elasticity, with a risk of a prolonged delivery and perineal tears. Episiotomy may be necessary but may not completely prevent tearing."}

{"text": "\n## 5.9 Perineal repair\n\n During delivery the perineum can tear causing different degrees of vulvovaginal lacerations: superficial (first-degree tear), or deeper, affecting the muscle tissue (second-degree tear, equivalent to an episiotomy). Two adjacent tissues may also be damaged: . The anal sphincter muscle, which is red and fleshy. A tear in this sphincter can be recognized by the loss of the anus' radial appearance (third-degree tear). Repair of the muscle is essential to prevent faecal incontinence. The rectal mucosa, which is smooth and whitish, extending from the anus. A tear in rectal mucosa (fourth-degree tear) must be sutured to prevent anal fistula with incontinence and infection. All genital mutilations – that is, clitoral circumcision (Type I mutilation), clitoral circumcision with removal of the labia minora (Type II mutilation), and infibulation (Type III mutilation, Section 5.10 ) – are associated with a risk of perineal tears during expulsion."}

All that is left is a residual opening at the base of the vulva for the passage of urine and menstrual blood. Infibulation may interfere with the ability to monitor cervical dilation and with the normal childbirth process. It can cause prolonged retention of the foetus against the perineum, increasing the risk of severe maternal tissue damage (tears and fistula) and the risk of foetal distress and death. Deinfibulation, performed during pregnancy or labour, may be necessary for the birth of the child. Double episiotomy is not an acceptable substitute for deinfibulation."}

Favourable factors for vaginal delivery are:  Frank breech presentation; A history of vaginal delivery (whatever the presentation);  Normally progressing dilation during labour. The footling breech presentation is a very unfavourable position for vaginal delivery (risk of foot or cord prolapse). In this situation, the route of delivery depends on the number of previous births, the state of the membranes and how far advanced the labour is."}

There can be difficulties (haemorrhage, difficulty extracting the foetus, etc.) and complications (bladder injury, uterine tear, foetal trauma, etc.).

Uterine rupture. . History of 3 or more caesarean sections."}
{"text": "\n## Relative\n\n The decision to perform caesarean section should consider the risk/benefit for the mother and the infant in the given context: access to services and the availability and level of neonatal care. The risks to the mother should be evaluated in the short term (death, infection, thrombo-embolism, etc.) and the medium/long term (future uterine rupture, placenta praevia or accreta during another pregnancy, etc.). In contexts with difficult access to services and a high fertility rate, the risks to the mother often outweigh the potential benefits to the infant. In any case, information about alternatives to caesarean section with corresponding risks and benefits should be shared with the woman, enabling hr to make a choice. Note: when a caesarean is planned, it should be done at 39 weeks LMP or later. Before 39 weeks LP, caesarean births without labour – even when not premature (37-38 weeks LMP) – are associated with a high risk of neonatal respiratory distress. That risk exists regardless of the estimated foetal weight. If the due date is uncertain and there is a very high risk of uterine rupture (e.g., history of severe uterine rupture or more than 3 prior caesarean sections), consider caesarean section prior to onset of labour, during the ninth month, with preparation for managing neonatal respiratory distress. In other indications, it is better to wait until the woman goes into labour to do the caesarean section. Under those circumstances, if the patient lives far away, suggest that she move near the facility where she will deliver during her ninth month, either with family or at a residential facility (maternity waiting home).

{"text": "\n# 8.1 Normal third stage of labour\n\n The third stage of labour refers to the period that starts immediately after delivery of the infant and ends with the completed delivery of the placenta and its attached membranes. There is a significant risk of haemorrhage during this stage. All patients require close monitoring and routine prevention of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH)."}
{"text": "\n## 8.1.1 Description\n\n This stage usually lasts 5 to 15 minutes. After the infant is delivered, there is a rest period without contractions that lasts, on average, 10 . minutes. Use this time to take care of the neonate. Watch the mother carefully, however, for signs of PPH, which can occur at any time. Then, contractions resume, the placenta separates spontaneously. On abdominal palpation the . uterine fundus can be felt ascending and then descending again, corresponding to the migration/descent of the placenta. When the entire placenta has reached the vagina, the uterus retracts and forms a hard ball above the pubic bone. . The blood loss accompanying delivery of the placenta should not exceed 500 ml. In the absence of PPH, a maximum delay of 30 to 45 minutes is tolerated for the expulsion of the placenta. After that, the placenta should be removed manually (Chapter 9, Section 9.2 )."}
{"text": "\n## 8.1.2 Routine prevention of postpartum haemorrhage\n\n \n## Active management of third stage of labour\n\n Active management of third stage of labour consists in the administration of oxytocin before placental expulsion, followed by controlled cord traction then uterine massage to help retraction of the uterus. After the birth, palpate the mother's abdomen to be sure she is not carrying twins. Administration of 5 or 10 IU oxytocin slow IV or IM immediately after the birth (after the birth of the last infant in a multiple pregnancy) AND before delivery of the placenta accelerates separation of the placenta, facilitates its delivery and helps prevent PPH. Then, after clamping and cutting the cord, deliver the placenta with controlled cord traction (during a contraction with counter pressure to the uterus, with a hand placed on the abdomen). Uncontrolled traction on the cord (i.e., done without a contraction or counterpressure) is contra-indicated, as it can cause tearing of the placenta and, afterwards, retention of placental fragments with risk of bleeding and infection. Page 172/ 279 When oxytocin is used prior to placental delivery, there is, in theory, and especially if the injection is not done immediately (i.e. within 3 minutes), a risk of retained placenta. For this reason, the birth attendant who administers oxytocin immediately after birth must be able to perform manual removal of the placenta, should it be necessary. If these conditions are not met, oxytocin should be administered after placental expulsion."}
{"text": "\n## Administration of oxytocin after placental delivery\n\n If oxytocin has not been given prior to placental delivery, it should be administered after the placenta has been completely delivered. However, this is less effective in preventing PPH. oxytocin slow IV or IM: 5 or 10 IU Uterine exploration to remove any placental fragments will be more difficult after injecting oxytocin.

Placental separation: press down on the abdomen just above the pubic bone. If the cord does not retract when pressure is applied, the placenta has separated (Figure 8.1). To facilitate expulsion from the vagina if it seems to be going slowly after the separation, apply moderate pressure to the uterine fundus, directed toward the vagina.

{"text": "\n## 8.2 Early postpartum haemorrhage\n\n Early postpartum haemorrhage is defined as bleeding that occurs within 24 hours (usually immediately) after delivery of the placenta. The volume exceeds the normal 500 ml third stage blood loss. Close delivery room monitoring is crucial for 2 hours post-partum, in order to rapidly identify and treat postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). Blood loss is often underestimated (up to 50%). Delay in treatment can lead to coagulation disorders, with a risk of massive, diffuse bleeding. The four main causes of PPH are:  Uterine atony (70% of cases): the placenta has been expelled, but the uterus fails to retract. The uterus gets larger, extends, and becomes soft. Factors for uterine atony include: overstretching (polyhydramnios, multiple pregnancy, foetal macrosomia), prolonged labour and infection (chorioamniotitis). It can be the cause or an aggravating factor of the PPH. Obstetric trauma (20% of cases): uterine rupture, particularly in case of vaginal delivery in women with a scarred uterus but also in women without uterine scarring; cervical and vaginal lacerations; uterine inversion. Retained placenta (10% of cases): the entire placenta or a fragment of the placenta remains in the uterus. Coagulation disorders (< 1% of cases): see Chapter 3, Section 3.2.2 ."}

{"text": "\n## 9.7 Embryotomy\n\n Destructive operation to reduce the volume of a dead foetus to facilitate vaginal delivery when obstruction prevents this from occurring naturally. There are several types of embryotomy: Craniotomy: a procedure in which a perforation is made in the foetal skull to reduce the volume of the foetal head which prevents delivery. It can be done on either an obstructed cephalic presentation or an entrapped aftercoming head in a breech. Cranioclasis: a procedure to crush the bones of the foetal skull. It is done if necessary after craniotomy in order to allow extraction of the foetal head. Decapitation: a procedure in which the foetus is decapitated to relieve impaction due to a transverse lie. Evisceration: a procedure in which an incision is made in the abdomen or thorax in the case of a mass or fluid collection (ascites) which is preventing delivery of the foetus. Cleidotomy: a procedure in which one or both clavicles are cut to reduce the biacromial diameter in case of a shoulder dystocia not resolved by other manoeuvres. Embryotomy, especially as often performed on a fragile and infected uterus, carries the risk of trauma (e.g., uterine rupture, cervical or vaginal injury, and damage to maternal soft tissue with fistula). This risk is especially high in the event of decapitation. Few people have experience with these procedures. The operators must have the knowledge of obstetrics, must feel comfortable performing obstetric manoeuvres and must have skills to manage potential complications. Some practitioners would rather perform a caesarean section on a dead foetus than have to mutilate a foetus. However, independently of the mode of delivery (by caesarean section or vaginally), obstructed labour carries a significant risk of puerperal infection, fistula and postpartum haemorrhage. In addition, caesarean section can place the mother at significant risk in terms of both survival and function. The objective of embryotomy is to reduce such risks. Embryotomy should be performed in a CEmONC facility (refer if necessary, even if the referral takes time)."}
{"text": "\n## 9.7.1 General conditions and precautions\n\n There is no urgency in extracting the foetus. The priority is maternal intensive care (intravenous line, IV hydration, antibiotic therapy for prolonged rupture of membranes or infection, and urinary catheterisation). The embryotomy can be performed once the mother is stable, under the following conditions: Confirm foetal death: no heart tones on foetal Doppler or ultrasound. . Confirm the obstacle to vaginal delivery due to size and/or presentation. . Page 203/ 279 Make sure there is adequate access to the foetus: full or nearly full dilation and ruptured membranes. Insert a Foley catheter. . Perform the procedure in the operating room under strict aseptic conditions and anaesthesia; always prepare for laparotomy in case of uterine rupture. Take time to explain to the mother and family the expected benefits (avoiding caesarean section) and potential complications (possible laparotomy if the event of embryotomy failure or uterine rupture). Obtain the patient’s consent. After extracting the foetus, routinely check: the uterine cavity (uterine exploration with antibiotic prophylaxis, Section 9.3 ); a the vaginal walls (use the vaginal retractors in the curettage set, for example, to get adequate d exposure). Care for the body of the infant: suture the skin wounds; clean and wrap up the infant to show/give him to the parents or family, depending on their choice."}

Insert one hand, shaped like a channel, into the vagina, in contact with the foetal head. Using the other hand, slide the perforator along the channel formed by the first hand (to protect the vagina) until it makes contact with the foetal head. This can be done under direct vision after retraction with vaginal retractors. The perforation should be made in the centre of the skull to protect the mother's soft tissues. It is easier to do it in a fontanelle. Rotate the instrument to make the perforation, and then remove it so that the cerebrospinal fluid and/or brain matter can drain through the hole. Once the cerebrospinal fluid spills out, the head should collapse and delivery should be easy; if not, apply traction to the skull with 3 or 4 forceps, gripping the scalp around the perforation.

Be aware that the caesarean section will be complicated, with potentially difficult foetal extraction and the risk of enlargement of the hysterotomy.

If the neonate is able to suckle but the quantity of maternal milk is not sufficient, the supplemental suckling technique offers the possibility to feed her/him with infant milk while stimulating milk production (Section 3.5). Always make sure that any medications being taken by the mother are compatible with breastfeeding, and if necessary, adjust the treatment accordingly."}
{"text": "\n## 3.1 Breastfeeding success factors\n\n The factors for success in breastfeeding are: Informing pregnant women about breastfeeding benefits and implementation. Putting the neonate to the breast early, within an hour of birth. Correct and comfortable positioning of mother and neonate. Proper latch-on allows effective sucking and reduces complications (cracks): the neonate should face the mother's body, with the chin against her breast, the nose free and the nipple and most of the areola in the mouth. For women with inverted or flat nipples: use techniques to help nipple protrude (nipple massage, use of breast pump just before the neonate feeds). Maintaining exclusive breastfeeding (unless medically contra-indicated). Breastfeeding on demand at least 8 times daily day (at least every 3 hours). Good hydration (at least 3 litres daily) and a caloric intake > 2500 kcal daily for the mother, as these directly affect the amount of milk produced. Nipple care, washing with clean water before nursing. An organisation that allows the mother and neonate to stay together 24 hours a day.  Help with maintaining lactation even if the mother has to be separated from her neonate (preventing milk production from stopping due to lack of stimulation). Do not stop breastfeeding if: The neonate has diarrhoea: explain to the mother that her milk is not causing the diarrhoea. Page 265/ 279 The mother is sick (unless serious condition): explain to the mother that her milk is not of poor quality because she is sick."}

{"text": "\n## Technique\n\n .  Wash hands, sit comfortably and hold the container under the breast. With the other hand, hold the breast up with four fingers, and place the thumb above the areola. Squeeze the areola between the thumb and the fingers while pressing backward toward the rib cage. Express each breast for at least 5 minutes, alternating, until the milk stops flowing.  If the milk fails to flow, check the technique and apply warm compresses to the breasts. Feed the neonate immediately after expressing the milk (by cup or nasogastric tube). If the neonate does not take all of the collected milk, it can be stored in a clean container in the refrigerator (2 to 8 °C) for a maximum of 24 hoursª . Warm the milk (water bath) to body temperature for the next feeding.

Tilt the cup/spoon so that the milk just reaches the neonate's lips. Let the neonate take the milk at his own pace; never pour the milk into the mouth. Stop feeding when the neonate closes the mouth and is no longer interested in feeding. If the neonate coughs or regurgitates multiple times, or is not able to take a sufficient quantity it means he/she does not yet have a sufficient swallow reflex. In this case, the neonate should be fed using a nasogastric tube until a later time. Page 266/ 279"}

Re-evaluate aspirate before next feed. a If the aspirate is clear or milky and ≥ 3 ml/kg: reinject the aspirate slowly and feed planned amount minus the volume of the residual. Re-evaluate aspirate before next feed. Continue feeds but do not increase feed volume until aspirate volume is < 3 ml/kg. d  If the aspirate is green, bloody, or fetid: do not re-inject the aspirate; stop the feeding, look for danger signs (Chapter 10, Section 10.3.1 ) and necrotizing enterocolitis (blood in stools and painful abdominal distension). Insert an IV line for maintenance fluid therapy ( Appendix 5 ), start antibiotic therapy before transferring the neonate to a neonatal care unit. Administering the milk: Take a sterile or clean (washed, rinsed with boiled water and air-dried) syringe, large enough to hold the total amount of the feeding. Remove the plunger and connect the syringe to the conic end of the tube. Pour the milk into the syringe, which should be held vertically. Ask the mother to hold the syringe 10 cm above the neonate and let the milk flow through the tube by gravity. Do not use the plunger of the syringe to force the milk down faster. Each feeding should last 10 to 15 minutes. For the daily amounts required for feeding, see Appendix 4 ."}

{"text": "\n## Epilepsy\n\n A first brief seizure does not need further protective treatment. Only patients with chronic repetitive seizures require further regular protective treatment with an antiepileptic drug, usually over several years. Once a diagnosis is made, abstention from treatment may be recommended due to the risks associated with treatment. However, these risks must be balanced with the risks of aggravation of the epilepsy, ensuing seizure- induced cerebral damage and other injury if the patient is not treated. It is always preferable to start with monotherapy. The effective dose must be reached progressively and symptoms and drug tolerance evaluated every 15 to 20 days. An abrupt interruption of treatment may provoke status epilepticus. The rate of dose reduction varies according to the length of treatment; the longer the treatment period, the longer the reduction period (see latrogenic causes). In the same way, a change from one antiepileptic drug to another must be made progressively with an overlap period of a few weeks.  First line treatments for generalised tonic-clonic seizures in children under 2 years are carbamaz epine or phenobarbital, in older children and adults sodium valproate or carbamazepine.

{"text": "\n## Notes on the use of morphine and derivatives:\n\n Morphine is an effective treatment for many types of severe pain. Its analgesic effect is dosedependent. Its adverse effects have often been exaggerated and should not be an obstacle to its use. The most serious adverse effect of morphine is respiratory depression, which may be fatal. This adverse effect results from overdose. It is, therefore, important to increase doses gradually. Respiratory depression is preceded by drowsiness, which is a warning to monitor respiratory rate (RR). The RR should remain equal to or greater than the thresholds indicated below: Children 1 to 12 months R ≥ 25 respirations/minute Children 1 to 2 years R ≥ 20 respirations/minute Children 2 to 5 years R ≥ 15 respirations/minute Children > 5 years and adults R ≥ 10 respirations/minute Respiratory depression must be identified and treated quickly: verbal and physical stimulation of the patient; administration of oxygen; respiratory support (bag and mask) if necessary. If no improvement, administer naloxone (antagonist of morphine) in bolus to be repeated every minute until RR normalises and the excessive drowsiness resolves: 5 micrograms/kg in children and 1 to 3 micrograms/kg in adults. Morphine and codeine always cause constipation. A laxative should be prescribed if the opioid treatment continues more than 48 hours. Lactulose PO is the drug of choice: children < 1 year: 5 ml daily; children 1-6 years: 5 to 10 ml daily; children 7-14 years: 10 to 15 ml daily; adults: 15 to 45 ml daily. Page 35 / 394 If the patient's stools are soft, a stimulant laxative (bisacodyl PO: children > 3 years: 5 to 10 mg once daily; adults: 10 to 15 mg once daily) is preferred. Nausea and vomiting are common at the beginning of treatment. Children: ondansetron PO: 0.15 mg/kg (max. 4 mg per dose) up to 3 times daily Do not use metoclopramide in children. Adults: haloperidol PO (2 mg/ml oral solution): 1 to 2 mg up to 6 times daily or metoclopramide PO: 5 to 10 mg 3 times daily with an interval of at least 6 hours between each dose Do not combine haloperidol and metoclopramide. For chronic pain in late stage disease (cancer, AIDS etc.), morphine PO is the drug of choice. It may be necessary to increase doses over time according to pain assessment. Do not hesitate to give sufficient and effective doses. Morphine, tramadol and codeine have similar modes of action and should not be combined.  Buprenorphine, nalbuphine and pentazocine must not be combined with morphine, pethidine, tramadol or codeine because they have competitive action.

Centor criteria help assessment and decrease the empirical use of antibiotics in settings where rapid testing for GAS is not available. A Centor score of less than 2 rules out GAS infection [1] [2] .

{"text": "\n## Diphtheria\n\n \n## Last updated: October 2022\n\n Diphtheria is a bacterial infection due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae, spread from person to person through inhalation of infected respiratory droplets of symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals, or direct contact with contaminated objects or diphtheria skin lesions [1][2]a After infection, C. diphtheriae has an incubation period of 1 to 5 days (max. 10 days) [1] during which time it multiplies in the upper respiratory tract. The bacteria secretes a toxin which causes severe local as well as systemic effects. Death can occur from airway obstruction or as a result of systemic complications, including damage to the myocardium and nervous system, caused by the toxin. Cases can remain infectious up to 8 weeks after initial infection[2] . Antibiotic treatment can reduce infectiousness to 6 days[3] Vaccination is the key to prevention and control of diphtheria. It protects individuals from severe disease (fewer and less severe symptoms) but does not prevent the spread of C. diphtheriae. Clinical disease does not confer protective immunity and vaccination is an integral part of case management."}

Diseases, such as malaria, acute otitis media, respiratory tract infections, etc. can be accompanied by this type of diarrhoea. Diarrhoea with blood, caused by bacteria ( Shigella in 50% of cases, Campylobacter jejuni, enteroinvasive or a enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli , Salmonella ) or parasites (intestinal amoebiasis).  Infectious diarrhoeas are transmitted by direct (dirty hands) or indirect (ingestion of contaminated water or food) . contact. . The high mortality rate from diarrhoeal diseases, even benign, is due to acute dehydration and malnutrition. This can be prevented by adequate rehydration and nutrition."}

In 10% of infected patients, pathogenic amoebae penetrate the mucous of the colon: this is the intestinal amoebiasis (amoebic dysentery).

{"text": "\n## Trachoma\n\n Trachoma is a highly contagious keratoconjunctivitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis. The disease is endemic in the poorest rural areas of Africa, Asia, Central and South America and the Middle East. Infection is usually first contracted early in childhood by direct or indirect contact (dirty hands, contaminated towels, flies). In the absence of hygiene and effective treatment, the inflammation intensifies with successive infections, causing scars and deformities on the upper tarsal conjunctiva. The resulting ingrowing eyelashes (trichiasis) cause corneal lesions followed by permanent blindness, usually in adulthood. The WHO classifies trachoma into 5 stages. Early diagnosis and treatment of first stages is essential to avoid the development of trichiasis and associated complications."}
{"text": "\n## Clinical features\n\n Several stages can occur simultaneously[1][2] : Stage 1: trachomatous inflammation - follicular (TF) Presence of five or more follicles in the upper tarsal conjunctiva. Follicles are whitish, grey or yellow elevations, paler than the surrounding conjunctiva. Stage 2: trachomatous inflammation - intense (TI) The upper tarsal conjunctiva is red, rough and thickened. The blood vessels, normally visible, are masked by a diffuse inflammatory infiltration or follicles. Stage 3: trachomatous scarring (TS) Follicles disappear, leaving scars: scars are white lines, bands or patches in the tarsal conjunctiva. Stage 4: trachomatous trichiasis (TT) Due to multiple scars the margin of the eyelid, usually the upper lid, turns inwards (entropion); the eyelashes rub against the comea and cause ulcerations and chronic inflammation.  Stage 5: corneal opacity (CO) Cornea gradually loses its transparency, leading to visual impairment and blindness."}

Stage 3: no treatment  Stage 4: surgical treatment While waiting for surgery, if regular patient follow-up is possible, taping eyelashes to the eyelid is a palliative measure that can help protect the cornea. In certain cases, this may lead to permanent correction of the trichiasis within a few months. The method consists in sticking the ingrowing eyelashes to the external eyelid with a thin strip of sticking-plaster, making sure that the eyelid can open and close perfectly. Replace the plaster when it starts to peel off (usually once a week); continue treatment for 3 months. Page 162/ 394 Note: epilation of ingrowing eyelashes is not recommended since it offers only temporary relief and regrowing eyelashes are more abrasive to the cornea. Stage 5: no treatment"}

{"text": "\n## Schistosomiases\n\n Schistosomiases are acute or chronic visceral parasitic diseases due to 5 species of trematodes (schistosomes). The three main species infecting humans are Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum. Schistosoma mekongi and Schistosoma intercalatum have a more limited distribution. Humans are infected while wading/bathing in fresh water infested with schistosome larvae. Symptoms occurring during the phases of parasite invasion (transient localized itching as larvae penetrate the skin) and migration (allergic manifestations and gastrointestinal symptoms during migration of schistosomules) are frequently overlooked. In general, schistosomiasis is suspected when symptoms of established infection become evident. Each species gives rise to a specific clinical form: genito-urinary schistosomiasis due to S. haematobium , intestinal schistosomiasis due S. mansoni, S. japonicum, S. mekongi and S. intercalatum. The severity of the disease depends on the parasite load. Heavily infected patients are prone to visceral lesions with potentially irreversible sequelae. Children aged 5 to 15 years are particularly at risk: prevalence and parasite load are highest in this age group. An antiparasitic treatment should be administered to reduce the risk of severe lesions, even if there is a likelihood of re- infection."}

The infection is noncontagious. Clostridium tetani is introduced into the body through a wound and produces a toxin whose action on the central nervous system is responsible for the symptoms of tetanus. Tetanus is entirely preventable by vaccination. It occurs in people who have not been fully vaccinated before exposure or have not received adequate post-exposure prophylaxis. In these individuals, most breaks in the skin or mucous membranes carry a risk of tetanus, but the wounds with the greatest risk are: the stump of the umbilical cord in neonates, puncture wounds, wounds with tissue loss or contamination with foreign material or soil, avulsion and crush injuries, sites of non-sterile injections, chronic wounds (e.g. lower extremity ulcers), burns and bites. Surgical or obstetrical procedures performed under non-sterile conditions also carry a risk of tetanus."}

Transmission by transfusion of contaminated blood and transplacental transmission to the foetus have also been reported. Four different serotypes of dengue have been described. Infection with one serotype provides a lifelong immunity to that specific serotype, but only partial, short-term immunity to other serotypes. There is no specific antiviral treatment. Dengue is a mainly urban disease, present in tropical and subtropical regions ® , in particular in Asia, Central and South America and the Caribbean. Outbreaks have been described in Eastern Africa.

Two subtypes of HIV have been identified. HIV-1 is more widespread than HIV-2, the latter mainly being found in West Africa. HIV-2 is less virulent and less transmissible than HIV-1. HIV weakens the immune system by causing a deficit in CD4 T lymphocytes."}

Asymptomatic HIV infection (after seroconversion): a period of clinical latency, but not viral latency. The time period for progression from HIV infection to the development of severe immune deficiency in western countries is approximately 10 years. This period appears to be shorter in developing countries. . Symptomatic HIV infection: with progressive destruction of the immune system, common and more severe diseases occur more frequently, and with higher mortality, in seropositive individuals. AIDS: this stage corresponds to the development of severe opportunistic infections and neoplasms. From a .  biological point of view, AIDS is defined as a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm³.

Primary or idiopathic NS is the most common cause of NS in children between 1 and 10 years. It usually responds to corticosteroids. Secondary NS is associated with infectious diseases (e.g. post-infectious glomerulonephritis, endocarditis, hepatitis B and C, HIV infection, malaria, and schistosomiasis) and may respond to treatment of the underlying cause. Children with NS are at increased risk of thromboembolism, severe bacterial infections (in particular, due to S. pneumoniae) and malnutrition. Untreated NS may progress to renal failure."}

Upon awaking, the child has periorbital or facial oedema, which over the day decreases as oedema of the legs increases. As oedema worsens, it may localize to the back or genitals, or become generalized with ascites and pleural effusions. . This oedema should be differentiated from the oedema of severe acute malnutrition (SAM): in SAM, the child presents with bilateral pitting oedema of the feet and lower legs that does not vary with position. Oedema extends upwards to hands and face in severe cases. It is usually associated with typical skin and hair changes (see Kwashiorkor: Severe acute malnutrition, Chapter 1).

In the event that venom is injected, the severity of envenomation depends on the species, the amount of venom injected, the location of the bite (bites on the head and neck are the most dangerous) and the weight, general condition and age of the individual (more serious in children). It is rare that the snake involved is identified. However, observation of the clinical signs may orient diagnosis and management. Two major syndromes are identified:  neurological disorders that evolve towards respiratory muscle paralysis and coma are common manifestations a of elapid envenomation (cobra, mamba, etc.); extensive local lesions (intense pain, inflammation with oedema and necrosis) and coagulation abnormalities are d common manifestations of viperid or crotalid (rattle snake) envenomation. Clinical manifestations and management of bites and envenomations are described in the table below. Early diagnosis and monitoring of coagulation abnormalities is based on whole blood clotting tests performed in a dry tube (at the patient's arrival and then every 4 to 6 hours for the first day). Take 2 to 5 ml of whole blood, wait 30 minutes and examine the tube:  Complete clotting: no coagulation abnormality ם Incomplete clotting or no clotting: coagulation abnormality, susceptibility to bleeding a  In the event of coagulation abnormalities, continue to monitor once daily until coagulation returns to normal. Aetiological treatment is based on the administration of snake antivenom serum, only if there are clear clinical manifestations of envenomation or coagulation abnormalities are observed. Antivenom sera are effective, but rarely available (verify local availability) and difficult to store. Antivenom serum should be administered as early as possible: by IV infusion (in 0.9% sodium chloride) if using a poorly purified serum; by slow IV in the event of severe envenomation if the serum is known to be well purified.

The criteria for administration are the severity of the envenomation, the age of the patient (more severe in children) and the time elapsed since the sting. This should not exceed 2 to 3 hours. If the time elapsed is more than 2 or 3 hours, the benefit of antivenom serum is poor in comparison with the risk of anaphylaxis (in contrast to envenomation by snakes). Symptomatic treatment: In the event of vomiting, diarrhoea or excessive sweating: prevention of dehydration (oral rehydration salts), D especially in children. ם  In the event of muscle pain: 10% calcium gluconate slow IV (children: 5 ml per injection, adults: 10 ml per injection, administered over 10 to 20 minutes). In the event of seizures: diazepam may be used with caution; the risk of respiratory depression is increased in a envenomated patients (see Seizures, Chapter 1)."}

Anxiety is a common feature in depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and psychosis. It can also occur in isolation, not associated with any other mental disorders. Anxiety symptoms often occur immediately after a difficult life event.  Medically unexplained symptoms are frequent in refugees and people exposed to adversity; in certain cultures they may be the only expression of psychological distress."}
{"text": "\n## Management\n\n Try to determine the source of the anxiety and reassure the patient (without minimising the distress or symptoms). If necessary, use simple relaxation techniques to alleviate the symptoms a If symptoms are exacerbated (e.g., tachycardia, feeling of suffocation, fear of dying or \"going crazy,\" agitation, or conversely, prostration), it may be necessary to administer diazepam: 5 to 10 mg PO or 10 mg IM, to be repeated  after one hour if required.

Agitation is common in acute intoxication (alcohol/psychostimulant drugs) and withdrawal syndrome. Certain drugs may cause agitation (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), levodopa, mefloquine, efavirenz, etc.). Agitation may be accompanied by oppositional, violent or fleeing behaviour."}
{"text": "\n## Management\n\n Clinical evaluation is best performed in pairs, in a calm setting, with or without the person's family/friends, depending on the situation. It is essential to check for signs of delirium. If present, the priority is to identify the cause and treat it (see Acute confusional state). It may be necessary to administer diazepam 10 mg PO to reduce the agitation and conduct the clinical exam, without over-sedating the patient. If the patient is violent or dangerous, urgent sedation is required: diazepam IM 10 mg, to be repeated after 30 to 60 minutes if necessary. Physical restraint should only be used in certain circumstances, strictly following the procedure in place. Avoid diazepam if agitation is related to acute alcohol intoxication or in case of delirium (risk of respiratory depression). Use haloperidol (see Acute confusional state). Alcoholic patients can experience withdrawal symptoms within 6 to 24 hours after they stop drinking. Withdrawal syndrome should be taken into consideration in patients who are hospitalised and therefore forced to stop drinking abruptly. In the early phase (pre-delirium tremens), the symptoms include irritability, a general feeling of malaise, profuse sweating and shaking. Treatment consists in: diazepam PO (10 mg every 6 hours for 1 to 3 days, then reduce and stop over 7 days) + oral hydration (3 litres of water daily) + thiamine IM or very slow IV (100 mg 3 times daily for at least 3 days) If the agitation is associated with anxiety, see Anxiety; if associated with psychotic disorders, see Psychotic disorders.

Also consider the use of drugs which may cause delirium (opioid analgesics, psychotropic drugs, fluoroquinolones, etc.), use of toxic substances (alcohol/drugs), or withdrawal from these substances. Delirium requires hospitalisation. Treat the underlying cause. Provide supportive care (i.e. nutrition, fluid, electrolyte balance); ensure bladder function. . Ensure that the patient receives only medications appropriate to their needs. . Treat pain if needed (see Pain, Chapter 1); . Ensure adequate sensory environment: low lightening, limit noise.

{"text": "\n## Post-traumatic stress disorder\n\n \n## Last updated: November 2021\n\n An event is \"traumatic\" when someone has been directly confronted with death, either by seeing another person being killed or seriously injured as the result of violence, or by experiencing serious harm, such as a threat to his/her life or physical integrity (e.g. rape, torture). Exposure to one or several of these events causes feelings of helplessness and horror. Immediate, transitory symptoms (disorientation, anxiety, sadness, fleeing, etc.) are to be distinguished from secondary, long-lasting problems that appear and/or last several weeks or months after the event: post-traumatic stress, often associated with depression (Depression), or sometimes acute psychosis (Psychotic disorders), even in people with no history of psychotic symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder is characterized by three types of psychological response, generally seen in combination[1] . Persistent re-experiencing The patient describes: images, thoughts or perceptions related to the traumatic experience, which intrude despite efforts to block them out, including at night in the form of distressing dreams; flashbacks during which the patient \"relives\" parts of the traumatic scene. Avoidance The patient tries to avoid: places, situations and people that might be associated with the trauma; having thoughts or feelings related to the trauma; patients may use alcohol, drugs or any psychotropic agents for this purpose.  Persistent perceptions of heightened current threat Hypervigilance (constant state of alert), exaggerated startle reaction, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration; sometimes somatic symptoms (sweating, shaking, tachycardia, headache, etc.). Re-experiencing is highly distressing and causes disorders that may worsen over time; people isolate themselves, behave differently, stop fulfilling their family/social obligations, and experience diffuse pain and mental exhaustion."}
{"text": "\n## Management\n\n Psychological intervention is essential to reduce the suffering, disabling symptoms and social handicaps resulting from PTSD. It is important to reassure the patient that their symptoms are a normal response to an abnormal event. Sessions should be conducted with tact. The patient should be listened to. Avoid intensely questioning the patient about their emotions: leave it to the patient to decide how far they want to go. Associated symptoms (anxiety or insomnia), if persistent, can be relieved by symptomatic treatment (see Anxiety and Insomnia) for no more than two weeks. If the patient has severe symptoms (obsessive thoughts, pronounced hypervigilance, comorbid despression etc.), the pharmacological treatment is fluoxetine PO (20 mg once daily) or paroxetine PO (10 to 20 mg once daily) or sertraline PO (50 mg once daily), to be continued for 2 to 3 months after symptoms resolve then, stop gradually.

For example, the depressed patient may express multiple somatic complaints rather than psychological distress. Depression may also manifest itself as an acute psychotic disorder in a given cultural context."}
{"text": "\n## Management\n\n When faced with symptoms of depression, consider an underlying organic cause (e.g. hypothyroidism or Parkinson’s disease) or adverse effects from medical treatment (corticosteroids, cycloserine, efavirenz, mefloquine, etc.). Look for a triggering event (e.g. sexual violence, recent childbirth and post-partum depression). Depressive disorders are the most common mental disorders in patients with severe chronic infectious diseases such as HIV infection or tuberculosis. These disorders should not be neglected, especially as they have a negative impact on adherence to treatment.  Symptoms of depression are common after a major loss (bereavement, forced displacement, etc.). They gradually subside, in most cases, with social support. Psychological support may be useful. Pharmacological treatment should always be offered, along with counseling, to patients with severe depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score > 19; severe functional impairment, psychotic symptoms, and/or suicidal risk). In patients with moderately severe depression (PHQ-9 score 15-19), pharmacological treatment should be considered if there is no improvement after 3 counselling sessions, or from the outset if patients express a personal preference for it.  Before prescribing, make sure that 9-month treatment and follow-up (psychological support, adherence and response) are possible. Page 358/ 394 Preferably use a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), particularly in older patients. Preferably use fluoxetine, except during pregnancy when sertraline is preferred. fluoxetine PO: 20 mg on alternate days for one week, then once daily for 3 weeks, then increase the dose if necessary (max. 40 mg daily); use with caution in patients with severe anxiety disorders or who are immobilised (e.g. wounded) o paroxetine PO: 10 mg once daily for 3 days, then 20 mg once daily for 3 weeks, then increase the dose if necessary (max. 40 mg daily), especially if the depression is accompanied by severe anxiety sertraline PO: 25 mg once daily for 3 days, then 50 mg once daily for 3 weeks, then increase the dose if necessary (max. 100 mg daily) Assess tolerance and response every week for 4 weeks. If the response is inadequate after 4 weeks at optimal dose or if the SRI is poorly tolerated, replace with another SRI (there is no need for a medication-free interval between the two). If SRIs are not available, amitriptyline PO may be used as an alternative: start with 25 mg once daily at bedtime and gradually increase over 8 to 10 days to 75 mg once daily (max. 150 mg daily). The therapeutic dose is close to the lethal dose; in older patients, reduce the dose by half. There is a delay of 2 to 3 weeks before the antidepressant effect of SRIs occurs, at least 4 weeks for amitriptyline. During this period, anxiety may be exacerbated and the risk of suicide may increase, especially with fluoxetine. Hydroxyzine PO (25 to 50 mg 2 times daily, max 100 mg daily) or promethazine PO (25 to 50 mg once daily at bedtime) may be given for the first 2 weeks of treatment. If there is no improvement after 1 week, change to diazepam PO (2.5 to 5 mg 2 times daily) for 2 weeks max. During the first 2 to 4 weeks, do not give the patient more tablets than the quantity required for each week or entrust the treatment to someone in the patient's close entourage that can initially ensure administration of the drug. Severe depression carries the risk of suicide. Talking to patients about this will not increase the risk of suicide attempt. On the contrary – depressed people are often anxious and ambivalent about suicide and feel relieved when able to talk about it. If major symptoms have not improved after a month of treatment, increase to the maximum dose and assess after 2 weeks. If there is no improvement, refer the patient to a psychiatrist, if possible; if not, try a different antidepressant. The treatment should always be stopped gradually over a 4-week period. Inform the patient about problems associated with abrupt treatment discontinuation (very common with paroxetine)."}
{"text": "\n## Special situations: pregnant or breast-feeding women\n\n Pregnancy in a woman under antidepressants: . Re-evaluate the need to continue treatment. If treatment is still necessary, it is best to continue a treatment that has been effective rather than switching to a different antidepressant. Nevertheless, if the woman plans to breastfeed and is taking fluoxetine, consider switching to another SRI at least 3 weeks before expected delivery to reduce adverse effects in the neonate during breastfeeding. Monitor the neonate the first few days of life for signs of toxicity or withdrawal symptoms. Depression occurring during pregnancy or during post-partum period: Depression is more frequent in the post-partum (breast-feeding) period than in pregnancy. In case of severe post- partum depression in a breast-feeding woman: use sertraline as first-line option, or if not available, use paroxetine: do not administer fluoxetine. In case of severe depression during pregnancy: use sertraline, avoid paroxetine.

{"text": "\n## Last updated: July 2022\n\n  Psychoses are characterised by delusions (the patient is convinced of things that are not real and not accounted for by the person's cultural background), or hallucinations (the patient hears voices that do not exist) and behavioural symptoms (e.g. strange behaviour, agitation, mutism, opposition, fleeing). Management includes psychosocial support and antipsychotic medication. Treatment efficacy and prognosis depend largely on the quality of the therapeutic relationship established with the patient and their family. Keeping the patient at home with outpatient follow-up is preferred if there is no risk of self-harm or harm to others, and if the family is capable of managing the disorder. Interpretation of psychotic symptoms vary according to the cultural context a . For example, psychotic disorders may be attributed to charms or to ancestor intervention. Therapeutic approach should take those beliefs into account. Patients are usually already under “traditional” treatments, this should not be seen as an obstacle to conventional medical treatment."}

{"text": "\n## Acute psychotic episode\n\n \n## Last updated: July 2022\n\n An acute psychotic episode can be a one-time occurrence, usually of sudden onset, or can occur repeatedly, or it may be the early phase of chronic psychosis. It can occur following an adverse life event (e.g. loss, acute stress or trauma). In postpartum psychosis, delusions are frequently related to the mother-child relationship. Before prescribing antipsychotic medication, consider the possibility of an underlying organic cause (see Acute confusional state (delirium)) or substance use; check and record blood pressure, heart rate, weight. Antipsychotic treatment is the same as for chronic psychoses (haloperidol or risperidone) and should last at least 3 months. After 3 months, if the patient is stable, stop the treatment gradually over 4 weeks, monitoring for potential relapse. If the acute episode lasted more than 3 months, continue antipsychotic treatment for at least 2 years. For severe anxiety or agitation, a short-course anxiolytic or sedative treatment may be added to the antipsychotic treatment, at the beginning of treatment. Page 362/ 394"}
{"text": "\n## Chronic psychoses\n\n \n## Last updated: July 2022\n\n Chronic psychoses (schizophrenia, paranoid psychosis, etc.) are defined by specific clinical characteristics and their long-term nature. Schizophrenia is characterized by delusions, disorganized thinking, hallucinations, depersonalisation, loss of motivation, diminished emotional expression, impaired cognition, abnormal behaviour and neglected hygiene. Such patients are  often very anxious. The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms and improve social and occupational functioning. It offers real benefits, even if chronic symptoms persist (tendency toward social isolation, possible relapses and periods of increased behavioural problems, etc.). Before prescribing antipsychotic medication, consider the possibility of an underlying organic cause (see Acute confusional state (delirium)) and use of substances. Check and record blood pressure, heart rate and weight. Treatment should last at least one year, possibly for life, particularly in patients with schizophrenia. Uncertainty about the possibility of follow-up at one year or beyond is no reason not to treat. However, it is better not to start pharmacological treatment for patients who have no family/social support (e.g. homeless), provided they do not have  severe behavioural disorders. Only prescribe one antipsychotic at a time. To limit the risk of adverse effects, start treatment at a low dose and gradually increase until the minimum effective dose is reached. In older patients, reduce the dose by half, whichever medication is used. Haloperidol is the first-line antipsychotic. Preferably use oral haloperidol with a view to switching to long-acting haloperidol (haloperidol decanoate) if the patient is likely to need long-term treatment (e.g. patients with schizophrenia). haloperidol PO: start with 0.5 mg 2 times daily for 3 days then 1 mg 2 times daily until the end of the first week; increase to 2.5 mg 2 times daily the second week. After 2 weeks, assess if the treatment is well tolerated and effective. If it is not effective, check adherence; if necessary increase to 5 mg 2 times daily (max. 15 mg daily). If haloperidol is not available, contraindicated or poorly tolerated, possible alternative are: risperidone PO: 1 mg 2 times daily for one week, then 2 mg 2 times daily for one week; if necessary, increase to 3 mg 2 times daily as of the third week (max. 10 mg daily). chlorpromazine PO (especially if a sedative effect is required): 25 to 50 mg once daily in the evening for one week; if necessary, increase to 50 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening for one week; if necessary, 100 mg 3 times daily as of the third week. olanzapine PO: 10 mg once daily; if necessary, increase by 5 mg every week (max. 20 mg daily). In case of extrapyramidal symptoms, try reducing the dose of antipsychotic or, if the extrapyramidal symptoms are severe, add biperiden PO: 2 mg once daily, increase if necessary up to 2 mg 2 to 3 times daily (if biperiden is not available, use trihexyphenidyl PO at the same dosage). For severe anxiety, it is possible to add a short-course anxiolytic treatment (for a few days to max. 2 to 3 weeks) to the antipsychotic treatment:  diazepam PO: 2.5 to 5 mg 2 times daily For major agitation: Page 363/ 394 If the patient is not under antipsychotic treatment: haloperidol PO 5 mg + promethazine PO 25 mg, to be repeated after 60 minutes if necessary. After a further 60 minutes, if necessary administer promethazine IM 50 mg. In case of hostile or agressive behaviour, use IM route (same dose), to be repeated after 30 minutes if necessary; after a further 30 minutes, if necessary, administer promethazine IM 50 mg. High doses of haloperidol can induce extrapyramidal symptoms, add biperiden if necessary. If the patient is already under antipsychotic treatment: diazepam PO or IM: 10 mg to be repeated after 60 minutes if necessary Do not combine two antipsychotics.  For long-term treatment (e.g. patients with schizophrenia) a long-acting antipsychotic drug can be used once the patient has been stabilised on oral treatment. The dosage depends on the oral dose the patient is taking. The switch from oral to a long-acting antipsychotic should be gradual, according to a specific protocol. For information, at the end of the transition period from oral to long-acting antipsychotic, the dose of haloperidol decanoate IM administered every 3 to 4 weeks is approximately: Daily dose Monthly dose of of haloperidol PO haloperidol decanoate IM (a) 2.5 mg 25 mg 5 mg 50 mg 10 mg 100 mg 15 mg 150 mg (a) If haloperidol decanoate is not available, fluphenazine IM: 12.5 to 50 mg/injection every 3 to 4 weeks.  For a patient on risperidone PO: gradually decrease the dose of risperidone by slowly introducing haloperidol PO then, once the patient is stabilised, change to haloperidol decanoate every 3 to 4 weeks as above."}

{"text": "\n# Bipolar disorder\n\n \n## Last updated: July 2022\n\n Bipolar disorder is characterised by alternating manic and depressive episodes a , generally separated by \"normal\" periods lasting several months or years. Episodes of mania are characterised by elation, euphoria and hyperactivity accompanied by insomnia, grandiose ideas, and loss of social inhibitions (sexual, in particular). Depressive episodes are often severe, with significant risk of suicide. Look for family history of similar symptoms (particularly suicide), very frequent in bipolar patients. Pharmacological treatment: Episodes of mania are treated with haloperidol PO: 5 mg once daily for 3 days, then 7.5 mg for one week; if necessary, increase by increments of 2.5 mg per week (max. 15 mg daily).

Diazepam PO (5 to 10 mg daily) can be added during the first 2 to 3 weeks. If symptoms do not resolve after 2 weeks of antipsychotic treatment at maximum tolerated dose (and 2 different antipsychotics have been tried), add a mood stabiliser: valproic acid PO: 200 mg 2 times daily (Week 1) then 400 mg 2 times daily (Week 2) then 500 mg 2 times daily  (Week 3). This is usually sufficient to stabilise the patient; if necessary the dose may be increased by 500 mg weekly  (max. 1000 mg 2 times daily). o carbamazepine PO: 100 mg 2 times daily (Week 1) then 200 mg 2 times daily (Week 2) then 200 mg 3 times daily (Week 3). This is usually sufficient to stabilise the patient; if necessary the dose may be increased by 200 mg weekly (max. 1200 mg daily). Treatment should be continued until at least 8 weeks after complete remission of symptoms. Assess together with the patient the benefits and risks of pursuing long-term treatment. If is it decided to discontinue antipsychotic treatment, medication should be stopped gradually, monitoring for possible relapse. Depressive episodes are treated as for depression (see Depression ). If the patient has an episode of mania while on antidepressants, immediately stop antidepressants andtreat the episode of mania as above. An episode of mania while on antidepressants is indicative of bipolar disorder. Long-term treatment for bipolar disorder is based on continuation of the treatment that led to the remission of the manic episode: antipsychotic, mood stabilizer, or a combination of both. Treatment can be initiated by a physician trained in mental health, but a consultation should be set up as soon as possible with a specialist. Page 365/ 394 Valproic acid is not recommended in women of childbearing age. If it is necessary to start treatment, use carbamazepine. If a woman of childbearing age is already taking valproic acid, switch to carbamazepine by gradually decreasing the dose of valproic acid over a period of 2 weeks (do not stop treatment abruptly) while gradually starting carbamazepine. If a woman becomes pregnant or is planning pregnancy it is essential to contact a specialist to re-evaluate whether the treatment is still necessary and adjust the dose if needed."}

{"text": "\n## Endemic goitre and iodine deficiency\n\n Goitre is an enlargement of the thyroid gland. Endemic goitre occurs in iodine-deficient areas. Goitre can also be caused or aggravated by the regular consumption of goitrogens such as manioc, cabbage, turnips, millet etc. Goitre is an adaptive process: iodine is essential for the production of thyroid hormones; iodine deficiency impairs thyroid hormone synthesis; to compensate, the thyroid gland increases in volume. Thyroid function usually remains normal. As well as the development of goitre, iodine deficiency in pregnant women has serious consequences for the child (foetal and perinatal mortality, physical and mental retardation, cretinism). These risks must be prevented by providing iodine supplementation in iodinedeficient areas."}

Wounds can be either chronic or acute. Chronic wounds are wounds that are slow to heal, such as a leg ulcer. Acute wounds are wounds that go through the normal healing process, such as a laceration. They are usually caused by trauma or surgery. Wound healing can occur by primary, secondary or tertiary intention. HEALING TYPE  ACTION Primary intention Wound edges are brought together neatly with skin adhesive or sutures/staples. Healing usually occurs within days. Secondary intention Wound is left open – occurs when wound edges cannot be joined together. Exudate may be heavy. Healing can take a long time. Debridement may be needed. Tertiary intention Wound is left open and closed later, ideally within a few days (also known as \"delayed primary closure\"). There are four stages of healing: • haemostasis (occurs within minutes)  inflammatory phase (occurs within one to five days) .  proliferation phase (occurs within three to 24 days) . maturation phase (occurs from 21 days onwards). ."}

Wash your hands with soap and water and put on an apron. 3. Clean the dressing trolley with ICRC-approved disinfectant and set up the trolley. 4. 5. Ensure the patient is comfortable and the wound area is exposed. 6. Move the dressing trolley to the bed. Ensure the patient has privacy by using a screen, if available, or other means. 7. 8. Perform hand hygiene and put on gloves. 9. Open dressing pack on top of the trolley, opening the sterile field using the outer corners only. 10. Empty the dressing materials onto the sterile field, using non-touch technique. 1. Ensure the sterile field is set up with dressing solution. Pour saline into a pot or kidney dish. 12. Put a paper towel or pad under the wounded body part to protect the bed. 13. Remove the patient's current dressing. Inspect it for any exudate and then dispose of it in the clinical-waste bin. 14.

The pins are held in place by an external clamp or frame. The pins are used to assist with wound management in an open fracture, when there is considerable soft-tissue injury and/or bone loss. Ex-fix is the fixation method of choice for all fractures associated with weapon wounds, which should always be considered infected. When possible, it is preferred over other methods because it aids with early patient mobilization. When other methods of fracture alignment have failed or are unavailable, ex-fix can be used to keep the fracture aligned and in position in order to promote healing. Multiple pins are needed to stabilize a fracture, and the pin sites need to be well managed, observed . frequently and dressed regularly."}

Hand burns – these require urgent treatment. The hand can become swollen quickly, which can result in stiffness and contractures. . Chest burns – full-thickness chest burns can cause difficulty breathing and may require escharotomy. Facial and neck burns – these can result in airway problems. Neck and mouth burns can also cause ICRC NURSING GUIDELINES Inhalation injury: An inhalation injury is damage to the respiratory system. If the history of the burn indi- cates possible inhalation injury, or if there are burns to the face or neck, you must suspect inhalation injury. The following signs may be present: • difficulty breathing, shortness of breath or gasping • chest wall indrawing • wheezing or stridor • bronchospasm • coughing • blackish sputum • soot in the nose or mouth, or burned nasal hair • hoarseness • facial oedema • anxiety or confusion • headache."}
{"text": "\n## Examination for other injuries\n\n In step E of your primary survey, also examine the patient for other injuries, including: • spinal injury • airway obstruction • head injury • inadequate ventilation • circulatory collapse."}
{"text": "\n## Secondary survey\n\n Once the patient is stabilized and the burn is dressed, carry out the secondary survey. This includes taking a comprehensive history and performing a detailed, head-to-toe examination."}
{"text": "\n## MANAGEMENT\n\n \n## First-aid treatment\n\n If patient arrives at the hospital without previous first aid, drench the burn in cold water and remove burned clothes. If the burn is small, immerse it in or run it under cold water for 20 to 30 minutes."}
{"text": "\n## On admission\n\n In order to assess a patient's burns, you must: • expose the patient completely to examine all areas. • remove all clothing and jewellery. • keep the patient warm. • inspect the patient's front and back. If a cervical-spine injury is suspected, log-roll the patient to inspect their back. • cover the patient with a clean sheet."}
{"text": "\n## Fluid resuscitation\n\n • If a burn covers over 10% of TBSA in a child or over 15% of TBSA in an adult, fluid resuscitation is required. • You will need to know the percentage of TBSA burned, the patient's weight and the time of injury. • The most commonly used formula to calculate the fluid needed in the first 24 hours after injury is the Parkland formula. CARING FOR A PATIENT WITH BURNS Traditionally, the Parkland formula defines the volume of fluid to be given (in ml) as 4 x weight (kg) x % TBSA burned; however, this tends to over-resuscitate and guidelines now modify the formula depending on the patient and type of burn. The ICRC recommends the following modified Parkland formula for fluid calculation:"}
{"text": "\n## Parkland formula = 2 x weight (kg) x % TBSA burner /olume (ml)\n\n Give 50% of this volume in the first eight hours after injury, and give the remaining 50% over the following 16 hours. Type of fluid: Give crystalloid fluid – preferably either Ringer's lactate or Hartmann's solution. Normal saline can be used if nothing else is available. Maintenance fluid: Fluid requirements after the first 24 hours will be guided by urine output.  ADEQUATE URINE OUTPUT Children Adults  0.5–1 ml/kg/hr 1–2 ml/kg/hr Children also require a maintenance fluid like dextrose saline. (Refer to chapter 7 of the Interburns manual; see Links section, below.)"}
{"text": "\n## Investigations\n\n The following investigations should be carried out on admission: • haemoglobin count ● electrolyte levels • glucose level • if there is a history of trauma, possibly a chest and pelvis X-ray assessment of the patient's tetanus immunization status – if no cover, give a tetanus booster, . and for patients at a high risk also give tetanus immunoglobulin."}
{"text": "\n## Monitoring a patient with severe burns\n\n On admission and during the first 24 hours, patients should be monitored hourly in a high-dependency unit (HDU) if possible. Once the patient is stabilized, monitoring can be reduced to every four hours. The patient should remain in the HDU for at least the first 24 hours. The following must be monitored: • pulse • blood pressure • respiration rate • pulse oximeter • consciousness level • capillary refill • warmth of peripheries • urine output, strictly documented on a fluid-balance chart • pain score."}
{"text": "\n## Analgesia\n\n Major burns can be very painful and cause the patient a lot of anxiety and distress. Analgesia must be a pri- ority. Analgesia should always be given prior to a dressing change. ICRC NURSING GUIDELINES The anaesthetist will prescribe the analgesia for the patient, but keep in mind the following. • Minor burns Paracetamol, and sometimes tramadol, should be sufficient. Moderate pain . Give oral paracetamol and oral tramadol. Moderate to severe pain Oral paracetamol and morphine are required. Note: in the first 48 hours after a burn, oral drugs are not properly absorbed in the digestive tract, so either intravenous or subcutaneous morphine should be used. Morphine 0.2–0.5 ml/kg for adults and children. For children between three months and one year, half the dose. For children under three months, quarter the dose. A doctor will need to be present when morphine is given."}
{"text": "\n## Surgery\n\n • If the patient has circumferential burns, they may need escharotomy. The surgeon should perform this in the operating theatre within eight hours of injury. Some burns will require surgery to scrub and debride the dead tissue and to accurately assess the extent . of burn. Skin grafts may be needed for full-thickness burns. . • If the airway is compromised by a burn or inhalation injury, a tracheostomy may be needed."}
{"text": "\n## Nutrition\n\n • Good nutrition is critical to wound healing. For patients with severe burns, a normal diet is insufficient, and enteral feeds are preferred. Enteral feeding is also required if the patient is unable to eat. This should be started on admission, the earlier the better. Burns patients require high-protein, high-calorie diets with frequent, smaller meals throughout the day. . The diet should include therapeutic milk, plumpy nut, meat, pulses and egg mixes. . Patients will also require multivitamins. • Patients must be weighed weekly."}
{"text": "\n## Wound care\n\n Good management of wounds is essential. This includes wound dressings, prevention of infection, correct positioning, pressure-area care and assessment for surgery. Key principles of wound dressings: • Give analgesia 30 minutes prior to a dressing change. • Wounds should be thoroughly cleansed. Dressings should be thick and firm but not too tight. . • Elevate limbs to prevent oedema. Dressings should initially be done daily and then on alternate days once the burn wound is less wet. . However, dressings on infected burn wounds and wounds that are highly productive should be changed dily. • The first dressing should be done in the operating theatre as should subsequent dressings if very painful."}
{"text": "\n##  PROCEDURE FOR DRESSING BURN WOUNDS\n\n Prepare the patient, set up the dressing trolley, perform hand hygiene and put on gloves as per steps 1 to 12 1. of the dressing procedure in Guideline 2, on wound care. Remove the previous dressing. 2. Remove your gloves, use hand gel and put on new gloves. 3. 4. Loose tissue and blisters can be debrided with sterile forceps. CARING FOR A PATIENT WITH BURNS"}
{"text": "\n##  PROCEDURE FOR DRESSING BURN WOUNDS \n\n Clean the burn with povidone-iodine (PVI) scrub solution (one part 7.5% PVI to four parts 0.9% saline). If the burn is heavily contaminated, a deep and more vigorous cleaning will be needed. If it is too painful for the patient, this should wiping is sufficient. Rinse the burn with 0.9% saline. Do not apply it to the mouth or eyelids. 10. Remove your gloves and put on new gloves. 14. Wrap with a crepe bandage, firmly but not tightly. 15. Elevate the extremities and immobilize them in collaboration with the physiotherapist. NB Chlorhexidine can be used to clean burn wounds if it is available."}
{"text": "\n## Minor burns\n\n Dressing can be done on an outpatient basis. Use silver sulfadiazine or petroleum gauze, depending on the burn. If the burn is small, superficial and seen early (with no signs of infection) it can be cleaned with saline or soapy water."}
{"text": "\n## Facial or perineal burns\n\n Dressings to these areas are difficult to apply and hard to make stick. In these cases, the exposure method can be used: Clean the burn with saline and then cover it with a topical ointment such as paraffin. The aim is for a dry eschar to form. This technique is not to be used for other burns."}
{"text": "\n## Eye burns\n\n Irrigate the eye with sterile water for one hour. Refer the patient to an eye specialist if available. Note: The open technique (exposure method) whereby a patient is left naked under a mosquito net or receives water-immersion\ntherapy (bath) is no longer used. See \"Links\", bel"}
{"text": "\n## Physiotherapy and positioning\n\n The physiotherapist should be involved in burn-patient care from the outset. Correct positioning of the burned area and the patient must be ensured to prevent oedema, stiffness . and contractures. This is the key role of the physiotherapist. Pillows and towels can be used to keep limbs in alignment. ."}
{"text": "\n## Other aspects of nursing care\n\n Ensure vital signs are taken regularly. Strictly maintain the patient's fluid-balance chart. • Keep the patient sitting upright to help with breathing if necessary. Support the patient with pillows. Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended but may be necessary in the presence of a wound infection. . • Keep the patient warm. Patients must be nursed in a clean area of the ward. If a single room is available this is preferred . to ensure proper temperature and scrupulous hygiene. Ensure that there are fly screens on any open windows as well as mosquito nets. ICRC NURSING GUIDELINES Monitor the patient's mental health to observe for signs of depression, post-traumatic stress or other mental-health issues concerned with altered appearance, body image and acceptance. Always refer severely burned patients to the mental-health and psychosocial support team for mental-health support. Enlist the support of relatives and other carers to ensure optimal recovery from burns. . • Remind the patient and attendant that paraffin gauze is flammable and the patient should not smoke or get near an open flame."}
{"text": "\n## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n Severe burns should be referred to a specialized burn centre, where available. Do not forget tetanus immunization."}

{"text": "\n# ICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 10 CARING FOR A PATIE WITH WEAPON WOUND\n\n \n## OVERVIEW\n\n Weapon wounds are always considered contaminated and often result in massive destruction of soft tissue, bones and other structures. The ICRC practices three basic principles for managing weapon wounds: • Adequate debridement is performed (adequate surgical excision). The wound remains open under a secure dressing, which is left undisturbed. . • Delayed wound closure is performed (delayed primary closure). Surgical management according to these three principles has been proven to be safe and effective. It pre- vents complications such as infection and permits early wound closure – and thus a quicker recovery. It also reduces the number of dressing changes required, which makes nursing care easier and avoids unnecessary, painful procedures for the patient."}
{"text": "\n## OBJECTIVE\n\n \n## ASSESSMENT OR DESCRIPTION\n\n The surgeon and anaesthetist will assess the patient's condition and the wound(s) on their arrival in the hospital. They will decide if the patient needs surgery and how urgently. If the patient requires admission, the nurse must check and record their vital signs, pain level and conscious- ness level. Any current dressing should be removed and the wound readied for review by the surgeon. Once this has occurred, the wound should be re-dressed as per Guideline 2, on wound care. The following should be carried out as prescribed: • intravenous cannula inserted and bloods taken • antibiotics given analgesia given • intravenous fluids administered. If the patient requires surgery, they must be prepared as per the preoperative checklist."}
{"text": "\n## MANAGEMENT\n\n \n## Management in the operating theatre\n\n The surgical team will perform a debridement on the weapon wound. This will involve removing all dead, damaged or infected tissue to promote optimal wound healing. The surgeon will apply a dressing of single- layer gauze, covered by a bulky, absorbent dressing and held in place with a crepe bandage. This dressing is ICRC NURSING GUIDELINES designed to absorb blood and exudate from the wound. Limbs with large wounds should be immobilized with a plaster of Paris backslab. After the initial debridement, the surgeon will schedule a delayed primary closure (DPC), usually five days later. A DPC involves suturing a wound closed, covering it with a split skin graft, or a combination of both. How- ever, if the wound is very contaminated and more dead or infected tissue remains, a further debridement may be required. The surgeon will make this assessment during the planned DPC. If a re-debridement is to be performed, the wound and dressing must be left undisturbed for a further five days and the patient observed for signs of infection. Often the wound will be re-debrided once in surgery and then can be dressed on the ward, as per the surgeon's orders. Dressings should be changed regularly according to the doctor's orders until the wound is ready for a DPC."}
{"text": "\n## Nursing care\n\n A dressing is only to be opened and dressed at the surgeon's instructions. The surgeon will write in the notes or on the bandage for the date of the next change of dressing, debridement or DPC. Update the patient's whiteboard and nursing notes with the date of the next change of dressing/debridement/ DC. If exudate/blood soaks through the bandage, the dressing must not be removed but reinforced with extra layers of fluffy gauze and crepe bandage and the head nurse notified. The nurse should observe the patient for signs of infection, including: • complaints of pain at the wound site • foul-smelling dressing • increased temperature • increased heart rate • excessive wound discharge • distension or swelling around the dressing. At any sign of infection, document it and report it immediately to the head nurse and surgeon."}
{"text": "\n## ICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 11 PREOPERATIVE PATIENT CARE\n\n \n## OVERVIEW\n\n Care for a patient undergoing surgery begins preoperatively. It is important that the patient be assessed prior to surgery and that all necessary investigations be carried out and results communicated to the surgical team. Rigorous preoperative care will ensure optimal patient safety. This includes: • physical preparation – checking for any comorbidities or illnesses and the overall health of patient • psychological preparation – ensuring the patient is educated on and understands the surgery, consent is obtained and stress is reduced • maintenance of the patient's privacy and dignity, respecting local customs."}

{"text": "\n## PREOPERATIVE CHECKLIST\n\n The preoperative checklist should be filled out by the nurse the night before surgery. The morning of surgery, it should be checked again before the operation and the remaining details completed. The morning of surgery, the following must be done before the operation is carried out: • Ensure the consent form has been signed by the patient (or their legal representative) and the patient understands the procedure. • Check whether any pre-medication or intravenous fluids have been prescribed and whether they have ben given. • Check and record the patient's vital signs and general physical and mental condition. If vital signs are abnormal, or if the patient has a cough or severe anxiety, notify the doctor. Ensure the patient has showered/washed and is in a clean gown. . • Remove any jewellery, dentures, hearing aids and glasses. • Shave the operative site, if required. • If applicable, follow the specific nursing guideline for bowel prep ( Guideline 16 ) or skin grafts (Guideline 7). • Check that the patient is fasted and record the time. • Check whether the patient has voided their bladder and/or bowels. • Prepare the patient's file: ensure all blood and X-ray results, the consent form and any other paperwork are present. • Ensure allergies are documented in red on the patient file. • Put a name band on the patient. • Check the order of the operating theatre list: ensure that paediatric and diabetic patients are at the top of the list. • When the patient is ready for surgery, call for a porter. • Children: ensure children under 15 years old have been weighed prior to surgery. A parent/carer can accompany the child to the operating theatre. • Adults: patients should be weighed on admission and have a recent weight recorded prior to surgery. • Hand the patient verbally over to the operating theatre/recovery nurse together with all the necessary completed documentation: consent form, fasting time, last void, vital signs, X-rays and any specific concerns."}
{"text": "\n## Emergency cases\n\n When a patient arrives in the hospital and needs emergency surgery, the following should be carried out as quickly and efficiently as possible, using all available skilled members of the team: • Vital signs should be checked and recorded. • An intravenous cannula should be inserted, intravenous fluids started and bloods taken, if possible. • Prepare the consent form for signature. • Remove the patient's clothing, jewellery, etc. (keep them together in a safe place or hand them over to a relative) and wash the affected area if time allows. • Check and record weight if the patient is under 15 years old. • Record when the patient last ate/drank. • Administer and record any prescribed medication. • Put a patient file together, including patient identification number and essential details. • Remain calm and explain the specific procedures to the patient to ensure their compliance and reduce their anxiety. (Use a translator if necessary.) Be prepared to carry out preoperative invasive procedures as necessary (for example, inserting a chest . drain, urinary catheter or nasogastric tube). • Ensure any relatives/carers are given an explanation of what is happening and kept up to date by a staff member. • Ensure the safe and efficient passage of the patient to the theatres. Prepare for the post-operative reception of the emergency patient in recovery, the high-dependency unit or the ward, as appropriate. • Ensure excellent communication throughout with all members of the surgical and patient-care teams. PREOPERATIVE PATIENT CARE Paediatrics • Remember children under 15 years old must be weighed. • If child has severe malaria, surgery may need to be delayed. Always monitor for fever and other signs of malaria. Carry out a malaria test if necessary. A nutritional assessment should be done by the anaesthetist, and surgery should be avoided . for malnourished children unless it is an emergency."}
{"text": "\n## FASTING GUIDELINES\n\n • The night before surgery, the patient and their family should be informed about fasting times. This must be explained in detail, with an interpreter if needed, to ensure full compliance. • Ensure all night staff members are aware of all patients' specific fasting times. • Put a \"nothing by mouth\" ( nil per os /NPO) sign at the end of the patient's bed. • Ensure all patients receive any prescribed intravenous fluids overnight. Follow the below table for fasting times.

{"text": "\n## ICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 13 POST-OPERATIVE CARE\n\n \n## OVERVIEW\n\n Patients who have undergone surgery require close observation, first in the recovery room and then on the ward. The ICRC's Anaesthesia Handbook strongly recommends using a designated recovery area for patients or for patients to recover in the operating theatre. Where this is not possible, the patient should be nursed on the ward in a visible bed (close to the nurses' station) and be monitored closely. A recovery room (or \"RR\") is also known as a post-anaesthesia care unit (or \"PACU\"). It is where patients receive the short-to-medium-term care that they require following a general, spinal or epidural anaesthesia until they are stable, conscious, alert and thus safe to return to the ward. One-to-one nursing care is required in a recovery room until the patient can maintain their own airway, is well oxygenated and has stable vital signs."}

{"text": "\n## NURSING CARE IN THE RECOVERY ROOM\n\n When a patient is transferred from the operating theatre to the recovery room, the recovery nurse should obtain a verbal handover and completed documentation from operating-theatre staff detailing the operation done, type of anaesthesia given, patient condition and specific post-op orders. The recovery nurse should use the recovery-room chart to document care. The patient should receive one-to-one care. The following should be monitored at least every 15 minutes, or more frequently if required: • Airway – Check the patient's airway and ensure it is patent, ensure their head is elevated to keep the airway open, and if there are signs of obstruction perform a head-tilt/chin-lift and call for help. If necessary, ensure an oropharyngeal (Guedel) airway or laryngeal mask airway remains in position and patent until the patient starts to wake up and resist. Breathing – Check if oxygen therapy is required and administer it accordingly. Monitor and record . Circulation – Monitor and record the patient's pulse and blood pressure. Check their skin colour and any changes to skin colour. Look for bleeding and report it if present. Monitor and record the patient’s peripheral pulses if necessary. Disability – Check the patient's neurological status using their AVPU score (Alert, Voice, Pain, Unresponsive), check their blood sugar if they are diabetic and check their pain level. • Exposure – Ensure the patient is kept warm and check their temperature. Other – Check that the wound is not bleeding and the dressing is intact, check all drains and catheters, . check whether intravenous (IV) fluids are needed, and ensure the IV line is patent. ICRC NURSING GUIDELINES • Spinal anaesthesia – Make neurovascular observations, including for limb sensation. • Control the patient's pain and nausea/vomiting in recovery. Inform the anaesthetist if additional medication is required. Requirements for the patient to return to the ward: • The patient is conscious. • The patient is maintaining their own airway. • The patient is breathing well. • Vital signs are stable. • Pain and nausea/vomiting are controlled. • The IV cannula is in situ. If all the above are met, ensure the anaesthetist gives permission for the patient to return to the ward. Call the ward and ask the ward nurse and porter to come and collect the patient. Give a verbal handover and all completed documentation to the ward nurse. Provide information specifically on the patient's condition, surgical interventions, anaesthesia type, post-op orders, drugs given in recovery, vital signs in recovery and any specific concerns or instructions."}

If the patient is prescribed a clear fluid or other diet, ensure that this is ordered and offer it once . the patient is fully awake. Explain the reasons for the dietary restrictions to the patient and their relatives/carers to ensure compliance. Commence a fluid-balance chart – record all input and output (urine, faeces, drainage, intravenous . fluids, medications, oral intake, etc) over a 24-hour period. • Monitor and document when patient passes urine for the first time post-operatively. • If the patient does not pass urine within six to eight hours post-operatively or has a distended bladder or discomfort, notify the doctor. They may need a urinary catheter."}

{"text": "\n## ICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 14 PAIN MANAGEMENT\n\n \n## OVERVIEW\n\n The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as an \"unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage\". Pain is either nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive pain is pain that follows the normal pain pathway that happens as a result of tissue injury or damage. Neuropathic pain is related to abnormal processing in the nervous system, when nerve injury or dysfunctions happen and result in pain. There are three types of pain: • Acute pain: Lasts less than three months. Causes can be surgery, trauma or musculoskeletal, visceral Chronic pain: Lasts more than three months. Causes can be non-malignant conditions or neuropathic, . inflammatory or musculoskeletal conditions. • Cancer pain: Is related to a malignancy or cancer treatment. The ICRC Anaesthesia Handbook states that pain should be treated by balancing the 3 Ps: psychology, physical methods and pharmacology (drugs)."}

{"text": "\n## Pain assessment\n\n A person's pain level should be assessed prior to giving them analgesia. It is important to assess pain prop- erly. The mnemonic “PQRST” can help. It stands for: • P: Provocation/Palliation – What caused the pain? What makes it better/worse? What were you doing when the pain started? • Q: Quality/Quantity – What does the pain feel like? Is it sharp, dull, stabbing, burning, etc.? ICRC NURSING GUIDELINES • R: Region/Radiation − Where is the pain located? Does it radiate, or is it localized? • S: Severity – How serious is it? How long does it last? • T: Timing – When did it start? How long does it last? How often do you get it? Is it sudden or gradual? When does it occur?"}

{"text": "\n## OVERVIEW\n\n A chest drain is a tube inserted into the thoracic cavity to remove air and/or fluid from the pleural space. This allows for adequate expansion of the lung and the restoration of negative pressure in the thoracic cavity. If an abnormal amount of fluid or air collects in the pleural space, it can compress the lung, causing it to partially or fully collapse and compromising breathing. The surgeon inserts a chest drain into the fourth or fifth intercostal space, anterior to the axillary line just above the ribs. This is usually carried out in the operating theatre, but in an emergency it can be performed in the emergency room or on the ward. Chest drains are usually connected to an underwater seal drainage system, which enables the one-way move- ment of fluid or air out of the thoracic cavity and into the collection bottle. Caring for a patient with a chest drain is complex, and proper management is necessary to prevent life- threatening complications."}

It involves the application of a pulling force to a limb while a counter-force pulls in the opposite direction, therefore enabling a fracture to be held in alignment. A patient usually remains in traction for six weeks or more. Traction is used to: • restore and maintain straight alignment and length of the bone • limit movement and reduce the fracture • minimize pain • correct or prevent deformity • decrease oedema/soft tissue injury in the extremities • prevent muscle spasm • rest the joints. There are two main types of traction, skin traction and skeletal traction. Indications • Infants, children or the elderly, who require a small amount of traction • Fractured femur in adolescents For infants under 15 kg, skin traction is applied as so-called gallows traction, where both legs are hung above the patient with 90 degrees of hip flexion.

An SCI can be classified as complete or incomplete. • A complete SCI entails loss of all motor and sensory function below the level of the injury. • An incomplete SCI is a combination of varying degrees of sensory and motor function below the level of the injury. Fractures of the spine can be either stable or unstable: A stable fracture occurs when spinal alignment is intact and there is no risk of further damage. . It can usually be treated with a brace and rest. • An unstable fracture risks resulting in an SCI. Paralysis is the inability to move limbs and muscles and to feel sensations. Spinal cord injuries result in some degree of paralysis; paralyzed patients are classified as paraplegic, quadriplegic or hemiplegic. • Paraplegia: Paralysis of both legs with or without bladder/bowel involvement • Quadriplegia (tetraplegia): Loss of function below the neck with or without respiratory involvement • Hemiplegia: Paralysis of one side of the body, occurs opposite to side of brain lesion/injury"}

In a high-income setting, an intensive care unit (ICU) is a specialized department within a hospital that pro- vides intensive treatment, caring for patients with severe and life-threatening injuries or conditions requir- ing constant and close monitoring. An ICU requires specialized, sophisticated and sensitive equipment, a wide range of drugs, sophisticated diagnostics and laboratory support, and fully trained specialist staff members. Conditions such as trauma, severe sepsis and organ failure can be treated in an ICU. An HDU also exists in high-income settings and is designed as a step down from the ICU, providing close monitoring, specialized care and supervision to patients who are too sick for a general ward but not sick enough for an ICU. The patients can be stabilized in the HDU until they are ready for the ward. Currently, it is beyond the resources and scope of the ICRC to provide ICU care owing to the nature of the low-income, low-resource areas where hospital projects are situated. Instead, the ICRC offers HDU care to Often the ICRC hospital team will set up an HDU of sorts, which can be a stand-alone unit or a closed-off area on the ward or in the recovery or emergency rooms. In order to ensure the correct functioning of the HDU, suction, oxygen and a pulse oximeter are required (at a minimum). The area should be connected to a generator to ensure 24-hour electricity supply and should also have easy access to running water and a waste-management area. The ICRC does not promote the use of ventilators in the HDU owing to the lack both of infrastructure to support mechanical ventilators and of trained staff, including biomedical engineers, to ensure their safe use. Those who may need to be admitted to the HDU include patients with the following: • major/complex surgery • major trauma • complicated maxillofacial cases • tracheostomies in the first 24 hours • cerebral malaria • severe sepsis • major burns • severe head injuries."}

Occasionally, however, owing to a variety of constraints beyond the control of the hospital team, a physiotherapist is not always present. In the absence of physiotherapy services, the surgical team must be able to offer basic physiotherapy services to prevent unnecessary complications and promote good rehabilitation.

{"text": "\n## TREATMENT\n\n The aim of treatment is to stop fluid loss and replace lost fluids, bringing the patient to a state of homeostasis. Treatment of mild to moderate dehydration is the administration of oral rehydration salts (ORS) and close monitoring of vital signs until the symptoms are alleviated. Treatment of severe dehydration is the administration of prescribed intravenous fluids and ORS together with close monitoring of vital signs and maintenance of a fluid-balance chart. The WHO recommends that ORS be made of 75 mEq of sodium per litre and 75 mmol of glucose. Note: In adult patients with cholera, simple diarrhea or uncomplicated acute malnutrition, standard ORS should be used. In complicated acute malnutrition and all other situations, a tailored protocol needs to be defined by the doctor or nutritionist. 5"}
{"text": "\n## Adults\n\n Some dehydration (mild to moderate, or 5 to 10% dehydration): Give 2.2 to 4 l of ORS in the first . four hours. Then reassess in six hours. Severe dehydration (10% dehydration or above): Insert an intravenous (IV) cannula and give fluid stat, . 30 ml/kg in the first 30 minutes. Then give 70 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate over three hours. Use Ringer's lactate or Ringer's lactate with 5% dextrose. If both are unavailable, normal saline can be used."}

The WHO recommends the below for children with severe dehydration in a resource-limited setting: Oce the child can drink, give them ORS. – Revaluate the child after a few hours, and treat them according to their hydration status. If the child has seizures, you can give a rapid bolus with glucose. If the child has severe malnutrition, only give IV fluids if they are in overt shock (see the WHO guidelines in \"Links\", below). There is risk of causing fluid overload in severely malnourished children when you give IV hydration. In adults, standard ORS could cause heart failure owing to the excess of sodium relative to potassium. ReSoMal (rehydration solution for malnutrition) is recommended in such cases because it has a high potassium content relative to sodium and is thus thought to be safer.

Diarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of death in children under five years old. The WHO estimates that diarrhoea results in 1.5 to 2 million deaths per year. Diarrhoea can be classified as acute or chronic. Acute diarrhoea is the most common. It can be self-limiting and usually lasts under two weeks. Chronic diarrhoea lasts longer than two to four weeks and is more complex in origin. Diarrhoeal disease is spread from person to person, as a result of poor hygiene, and also through contamin- ated food or water."}

{"text": "\n## Classification\n\n The WHO identifies four clinical types of diarrhoea: 1. Acute watery diarrhoea (including cholera) – Can last several hours or days. − Dangers include dehydration and weight loss. − Most commonly caused by E. coli. – Other causes include cholera, Norovirus , Campylobacter , non-typhoid Salmonella . 2. Acute bloody diarrhoea (also called \"dysentery\" or \"invasive diarrhoea\") − Lasts under 14 days. − Often accompanied by a fever. – Can cause damage to the intestines, sepsis, malnutrition and dehydration. − Most commonly caused by Shigella. − Other causes include Campylobacter jejuni , invasive or enterohemorrhagic E. coli , Entamoeba hystolytica, Schistosoma mansoni. 3. Persistent diarrhoea – Characterized by loose, watery or bloody stools persisting more than 14 days. − Can cause malnutrition, dehydration and serious infection. 4. Diarrhoea with severe malnutrition (marasmus or kwashiorkor) − Dangers include severe systemic infection, dehydration, heart failure and vitamin and mineral deficiencies."}
{"text": "\n## Epidemics\n\n An epidemic is a rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population, usually in a short time. Shigella dysenteriae and Vibrio cholera cause epidemic diarrhoea: • Shigella infection ( shigellosis ) is characterized by small, liquid stools with visible blood, with or without mucus. It is accompanied by abdominal cramps, tenesmus, fever and anorexia. • Cholera is characterized by a large volume of watery diarrhoea that looks like rice water and sometimes has flecks of mucus. It usually presents suddenly, with vomiting and abdominal cramps. Please refer to the \"Links\" section below for guidance from the WHO and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) on managing cholera and dysentery outbreaks."}
{"text": "\n## ASSESSMENT\n\n In order to provide high-quality care to patients with diarrhoea, it is important to perform a thorough assessment and try to identify the cause of the diarrhoea and what type it is. It is essential to ensure good documentation in the patient notes and the use of fluid-balance and stool charts. The following should be assessed: • the history of onset, frequency and duration • the consistency, colour and form of stools • whether there is any blood or mucus in the stools • associated symptoms, e.g. vomiting, nausea, fever, weight loss and tiredness • lifestyle changes, e.g. stress or travel ICRC NURSING GUIDELINES • diet history and fluid intake • what medications the patient takes – laxatives, antibiotics, etc. • previous medical and surgical history – note any bowel or abdominal surgery ●   any comorbidities. The following examinations and tests should be done: • physical rectal exam by the doctor – checking for haemorrhoids, blood, rectal prolapse, etc. • assessment of the patient's hydration status – whether they are dehydrated and at what level (early, moderate or severe) • assessment of the patient's nutritional status – whether they are malnourished • stool sample for cultures/microscopy (if available) – checking for bacteria, fungi, parasites or viral pathogens • bloods if possible – full blood count (FBC), urea and electrolytes (U&E), liver function (LFT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), c-reactive protein (CRP)."}
{"text": "\n## MANAGEMENT\n\n Diarrhoea should be considered infectious until proven otherwise. It is important to reduce the spread of disease to others by adhering to universal precautions. These include wearing gloves and an apron, disposing of waste immediately and isolating the patient. If it is possible to determine the cause of the diarrhoea, this should be carried out without delay and the cause treated. If an underlying condition is causing the diarrhoea, this must be treated. (Underlying conditions can include respiratory or ear infections.) The main goal of managing a patient with diarrhoea is to prevent further complications and treat their symptoms. The nurse should aim to correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances (which will prevent and treat dehydration), to ensure appropriate nutrition is received and to manage any comorbidities. Care for a patient with diarrhoea should include the following:"}
{"text": "\n## Preventing and treating dehydration\n\n Diarrhoea often results in dehydration. When a person has diarrhoea, water and electrolytes (sodium, potas- sium, bicarbonate and chloride) are lost through their stool and through sweat, vomit, urine and breathing. If the lost electrolytes are not adequately replaced, dehydration occurs. Fluid management will depend on the amount of fluid lost and whether the patient is diagnosed as moder- ately or severely dehydrated. To determine whether a patient is dehydrated and to treat dehydration, consult Guideline 28, on treating dhydration. If the patient is not dehydrated, prevent dehydration by giving oral rehydration salts (ORS) after each loose stool, using the amounts below. The WHO recommends that ORS be made of 75 mEq of sodium per litre and 75 mmol of glucose.  AMOUNT OF ORS TO GIVE AFTER EACH LOOSE STOOL  AGE 50–100 ml < 2 yr 2–10 yr 100–200 ml > 10 yr 200–250 ml CARING FOR A PATIENT WITH DIARRHOEA Children without dehydration can be managed at home."}
{"text": "\n## Nutrition\n\n Diarrhoea in children is often linked with malnutrition. A child who presents with diarrhoea should also be assessed for malnutrition. When a child dies from diarrhoea, it is usually because they are severely malnour- ished. Diarrhoea results in a decreased intake of food and therefore a decrease in nutrient absorption, which results in weight loss and a failure to grow."}
{"text": "\n## Malnourishment\n\n • Continue to give nutrient-rich food during and after episodes of diarrhoea. • Encourage the mother to breastfeed and give the child ReSoMal (rehydration solution for malnutrition) in between feedings."}
{"text": "\n## No signs of malnourishment\n\n • Encourage sufficient feeding/eating during and after episodes of diarrhoea. ●   Encourage regular fluid intake and ORS. • Encourage breastfeeding or formula as well as ORS. The diet for all patients with diarrhoea should be high in energy and nutrition. It is best to give them six smaller meals throughout the day."}
{"text": "\n## Vitamin supplements\n\n \n## Zinc\n\n Zinc supplements have been shown to reduce the severity and duration of diarrhoea. The WHO recommends zinc be given for ten days to children under five with diarrhoea. Dose • Children under six months: 10 mg once a day for ten days • Children between six months and five years: 20 mg once a day for ten days"}
{"text": "\n## Vitamin A\n\n Children who have diarrhoea in a low-resource environment are at high risk of vitamin A deficiency. The WHO recommends a high dose of vitamin A for these children."}
{"text": "\n## Medications\n\n The WHO advises that antimicrobials should not be used in a low-resource environment. It can be impos- sible to test for the cause of diarrhoea and the sensitivity of the pathogen, which makes choosing an effective antimicrobial drug difficult. Antibiotics should not be given for watery diarrhoea. However, antibiotics can be helpful for: • bloody diarrhoea (shigellosis) • suspected cholera with severe dehydration • bacterial diarrhoea where the patient is symptomatic with systemic involvement. For antimicrobial guidelines, refer to the MSF Clinical Guidelines (2019), pages 85 to 89, which recommends Do not give antidiarrhoeal medications or anti-emetics. ICRC NURSING GUIDELINES"}
{"text": "\n## NURSING CARE\n\n The nurse should also ensure the following:"}
{"text": "\n## Privacy\n\n • Maintain the privacy and dignity of the patient. • Put them in a private room or area. • Give them a clean gown. • Provide air freshener or deodorant."}
{"text": "\n## Skin integrity\n\n • The skin can break down after multiple episodes of diarrhoea, especially around perianal area. • Ensure the area is cleansed with warm water after each stool. • Avoid the use of soap, as that can irritate the area. • Do not use talcum powder on the area. • Dry by gently patting the area. Do not rub. • You can use a barrier cram, but only apply a small amount."}
{"text": "\n## Documentation\n\n • Ensure fluid-balance and stool charts are maintained."}
{"text": "\n## PREVENTION\n\n Aim to prevent the spread of organisms from one person to the next and within the community. Measures to achieve this include: • ensuring handwashing with soap • ensuring access to safe drinking water • ensuring the correct disposal of human waste • ensuring food is handled and managed safely • controlling flies • encouraging breastfeeding of babies and young children • ensuring latrines are ten metres away and downhill from drinking water • giving the rotavirus vaccine for infants aged six weeks to 24 months in countries with a high incidence of rotavirus diarrhoea • giving cholera vaccines in endemic areas."}

{"text": "\n## OVERVIEW\n\n Malaria is a disease caused by an infection with a protozoan parasite of a species of Plasmodium . It is trans- mitted from human to human by the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito. There are five species of Plasmo- dium that affect humans: P. falciparum , P. vivax , P. ovale , P. malaraie and P. knowlesi. P. falciparum and P. vivax are the most serious. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in 2017 there were 219 million cases of malaria in 87 countries and over 435,000 deaths. Most cases and deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Other regions affected by malaria include South-East Asia, the East Mediterranean, the Western Pacific and the Americas."}

{"text": "\n## DESCRIPTION\n\n \n## Diagnosis/Laboratory\n\n Always consider malaria in a patient who lives in or comes from an endemic area and has a fever or history of fever in the last 48 hours. The WHO recommends any cases of suspected malaria be confirmed before treatment using a diagnostic test, either microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), unless testing is unavailable. If no diagnostic testing is available and malaria is suspected, treatment should be commenced. Microscopy: Thin and thick blood films can be done, which allow parasites to be detected, species . determined and the percentage parasitaemia measured (the percentage of red blood cells with parasites present). A trained laboratory worker should be able to perform this test. If the blood film is negative, repeat the test in six hours and then a further 12 hours later. RDT: These detect antigens of the malaria parasite present in the blood. They can remain positive . for days or weeks following an infection with malaria and effective treatment. The nurse can perform this test on the ward. Haemoglobin levels should be checked in all patients with severe malaria. Blood glucose levels should also be checked in patients with severe malaria."}
{"text": "\n## Incubation period\n\n The incubation period can be anywhere from one week to one year. For P. falciparum , incubation is usually nine to 14 days; for P. vivax , 12 to 18 days; and for P. ovale 18 to 40 days.

These are systemic infections caused by the bacterium Sal- monella. Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella typhi , and paratyphoid is caused by Salmonella paratyphi . The Salmonella bacteria enter the body through the gastrointestinal tract and then spread through the bloodstream. The bacteria are found in the faeces and urine of infected individuals and are spread through the ingestion of contaminated food or water and via direct contact (e.g. with dirty hands). In 2018 the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 128,000 to 161,000 people die from typhoid ech year."}

CARING FOR A PATIENT WITH TYPHOID"}
{"text": "\n## SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS\n\n Typhoid can range from mild to severe. Paratyphoid has the same symptoms as typhoid but is usually of shorter duration and less severe. Symptoms include: • a prolonged fever. This is the most common sign. The fever is either mild (38–39°C) or high (40–41°C). The fever slowly increases in the first week, remains the same in the second week and slowly decreases in the third to fourth week. rose coloured spots usually visible on the trunk. These are a very specific sign. They present as raised, . rose-red spots which fade on pressure. They can be difficult to see on dark skin. • a headache. • muscle aches. • abdominal pain. • nausea and vomiting. • fatigue and weakness. • chills. • a non-productive cough. • splenomegaly. • relative bradycardia. During the first week, the patient will have general symptoms. In the second week the patient becomes worse, and the signs and symptoms may be severe. During the third week, general and abdominal symptoms become even worse, and the bowel may perforate, or the intestinal wall may haemorrhage. If the patient does not die, they usually recover after the fourth week. Typhoid can lead to: • gastrointestinal haemorrhage • peritonitis • myocarditis • coma • encephalitis • pregnancy complications, e.g. miscarriage, preterm delivery and intrauterine death."}
{"text": "\n## MANAGEMENT\n\n \n## Nursing care\n\n The nurse should do the following when caring for a patient with typhoid: • Isolate the patient. • Keep them under close observation. • Ensure good hand hygiene is practiced by the patient, the staff and any visitors. • Treat the fever. Give paracetamol and use cooling measures if the patient's temperature exceeds 38.5°C and they look unwell. Note: the fever will not come down until four to five days after antibiotics are Ensure the patient is hydrated. Encourage oral fluids; if the patient cannot tolerate oral fluids, commence intravenous fluids. • Uncomplicated patients can be managed at home with oral antibiotics for seven days. • Complicated/severe cases (patients with pregnancies, neurological disturbances or altered general states) need to be admitted for close monitoring and intravenous antibiotics.

This vaccine is safe for those over six months of age. A single dose of 0.5 ml is to be given at nine months and then a catch-up dose at 15 years."}
{"text": "\n## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n • Patients with typhoid may present with an acute abdomen secondary to a bowel perforation. • Consider typhoid in any severely septic patient with a bowel perforation. Even after symptoms of typhoid resolve, a person can still remain a carrier of typhoid and spread . the bacteria to others. Therefore, they must take the full course of antibiotics, ensure strict hand hygiene, be tested up to one year later to see if they are a carrier and not prepare or serve food to others."}

{"text": "\n## OVERVIEW\n\n Ebola virus disease (EVD), also known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a rare but severe, often-fatal illness affecting humans. It occurs primarily in Africa. The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals (fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, etc.) and spreads through the human population via direct contact."}
{"text": "\n## OBJECTIVES\n\n To ensure health-care workers understand and effectively use protective measures when caring for a sus- pected EVD patient. To guide the health-care workers on how to identify a possible EVD case and care for a suspected EVD patient."}
{"text": "\n## TRANSMISSION\n\n EVD spreads via direct contact (through broken skin or mucus membranes) with the following: . the blood or other body fluids (sweat, urine, saliva, faeces, vomit, semen, breast milk) of a person who is sick with, or has died from, EVD • objects that have been contaminated with the body fluids of a person who is sick with, or has died from, EVD • semen from a man who has recovered from EVD (through oral, vaginal or anal sex) • infected fruit bats or non-human primates. A person can only spread EVD to other people after they develop signs and symptoms of EVD. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, EVD is not known to spread through food. How- ever, in some parts of the world, EVD can be transmitted when handling or eating wild animal meat that is infected with EVD. Mosquitoes and other insects do not transmit EVD."}
{"text": "\n## RISK FACTORS\n\n Those at highest risk of contracting EVD include: • family and friends in close contact with people infected with EVD • health-care workers who do not use correct infection-control methods when caring for EVD patients. Health–care workers have frequently been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed EVD. CARING FOR A PATIENT WITH SUSPECTED EBOLA"}
{"text": "\n## SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS\n\n The time between first contact with the virus and the onset of symptoms (the incubation period) is two to 21 days – eight to ten days on average. A person infected with EVD cannot spread the disease until they develop symptoms. Symptoms of EVD can be sudden and include: • initial \"dry\" symptoms such as fever, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, sore throat and abdominal pain • then \"wet\" symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting, rash/purpura, impaired kidney and liver function, unexplained haemorrhaging, bleeding or bruising and hiccups (late-stage EVD). Many common illnesses can have the same symptoms as EVD, including influenza, malaria, meningitis or typhoid."}
{"text": "\n## PROTECTIVE MEASURES FOR HEALTH-CARE WORKERS\n\n EVD is transmitted through direct contact with body fluids or with objects contaminated by body fluids. Pro- tective measures when caring for a suspected or confirmed EVD case include: • good hand hygiene – either hand-washing with soap and water or chlorinated water or using alcohol-based hand gel wearing protective gloves – one pair of non-sterile gloves and a pair of household rubber gloves on top wearing a protective mask with either a face-shield or glasses • wearing protective boots • wearing a protective gown or full-length coverall with long sleeves and long pants that go over the boots • wearing a protective plastic apron over the gown/coverall.

{"text": "\n## Laboratory-confirmed case\n\n Any suspected or probable case with a positive laboratory result. Laboratory-confirmed cases must test positive for the virus antigen, either by detection of virus RNA using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), or by detection of immunoglobulin M antibodies directed against the Ebola virus."}
{"text": "\n## WHAT TO DO WHEN A SUSPECTED CASE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED\n\n Staff trained in EVD identification, usually National Society volunteers, are responsible for screening all people at the entry point of the health facility where the ICRC is working. A World Health Organization (WHO) EVD identification questionnaire is completed by the screening staff for each person who presents with a high fever; if the answers on the form match with the definition of a suspected EVD case (described above) the screening staff informs the resident EVD focal point. The resident EVD focal point is usually a doctor or nurse trained in EVD and designated by the health centre's directorate. They are responsible for confirming the suspected case and notifying the EVD surveillance teams. The focal point is the link between the health centre and the Ebola response system. In area with a high risk of EVD or where there is a confirmed EVD outbreak, governmental or WHO surveil– lance teams are in charge of responding to suspected cases or initiating an alert of early warning signs of EVD.

{"text": "\n##  PATIENTS WITH FEVERS IN AN EVD AREA\n\n Non-ICRC patient - The identification staff members fill in the WHO EVD questionnaire. - If the questionnaire is negative , the patient can carry on to receive care as usual. - If the questionnaire is positive , it is a suspected case. The following happens: The patient and their carers are isolated to specific EVD areas. 1. The identification staff members inform the resident EVD focal point. 2. 3. The EVD focal point then contacts the EVD surveillance team. The surveillance team transfers the patient to an Ebola transit/isolation centre to get samples for EVD testing. 4. Two tests of the same kind are done – if the first test is negative, the patient is tested a second time 24 hours later. 5. It takes about 24 hours to get the result of each test. From collecting the first sample to receiving the result 6. of the second test, it takes about 72 hours. The carers are considered EVD contacts, so they get registered for close surveillance and vaccinated against EVD. ICRC patient - The identification staff members fill in the WHO EVD questionnaire. - If the questionnaire is negative , the patient can carry on to receive care as usual. - If the questionnaire is positive , it is a suspected case. The following happens: 1. The patient and their carers are isolated. The identification staff members inform the resident EVD focal point. 2. The resident EVD focal point inform the ICRC EVD focal point (usually the head nurse). 3. The ICRC EVD focal point informs the ICRC surgical team for an urgent surgical evaluation. The surgical team makes a risk analysis (is the patient's life or limb in danger? does the patient urgently need 5. surgical stabilization? etc.). The evaluation is done while maintaining distance between ICRC staff and the patient (a no-touch evaluation). - If yes – the team stabilizes the patient within the ICRC EVD stabilization area using specific, advanced personal protective measures. If no – the resident EVD focal point contacts the surveillance team to follow the two-test procedure, and the patient's carers are registered for close surveillance as EVD contacts. If the two tests are negative, the patient will be transferred back to the ICRC health facility to receive surgical care. If the patient is positive, they will be treated at the Ebola treatment centre."}
{"text": "\n## GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS WHEN WORKING IN AN EVD-RISK AREA\n\n • Hygiene is imperative – all measures to ensure strict hygiene standards must be put in place. • Handwashing points (with water and soap) must be available in each room. Education about good hygiene practices must be provided to staff and patients. Thorough washing of the hospital wards – walls, bedside tables, windows, etc. – must be done . on a weekly basis. Health staff must avoid direct contact with patients, carers and their belongings. Health staff must always wear personal protective equipment (e.g. gloves, a mask, an apron, closed . shoes) and practice hand hygiene. The temperature of the patient and their carers must be taken twice a day and recorded in the patient . notes. Visits must be restricted, and all visitors must be briefed on the need for reduced contact with patients as well as good hand hygiene. If an inpatient develops any EVD signs or symptoms, the ICRC EVD focal point must be informed as soon as possible to arrange further investigation (filling out the WHO questionnaire and contacting the resident EVD focal point, if necessary). For a positive questionnaire: the patient and their carer must be isolated; the resident EVD focal point must be informed and get in touch with the EVD surveillance team; all patients and carers with whom the suspected EVD case has shared a room are considered contact cases; the room and all its contents must be disinfected. For a negative questionnaire: search for other causes of the presenting signs and symptoms. Avoid any behaviour that could stigmatize the patient and/or their carer. . Ensure mental-health support is available for suspected EVD cases. ICRC NURSING GUIDELINES All health workers must be vaccinated against EVD. The Merck single-dose vaccine, known as V920 or rVSV-ZEBOV-GP, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in December 2019 and by the European Medicines Agency in November of the same year."}
{"text": "\n## EVD RECURRENCE AND REINFECTION WITH EBOLA\n\n EVD is understudied, and some aspects of the disease remain unclear. Studies have examined and continue to examine the possibility of reinfection with Ebola and recurrence of EVD. The long-term implications of recurrence and infection are unknown. Sexual transmission from survivors of the 2014 epidemic has been reported. There are also documented cases of survivors who have been readmitted to hospital with a seeming recurrence of EVD symptoms. EVD has been shown to cause symptoms in a recovered patient even though the virus had been cleared from their blood. Studies have shown that EVD can persist at immunologically protected sites in the body, includ- ing in semen, vaginal fluid, sweat, the aqueous humour (inside the eye), breast milk and urine. MacIntyre and Chughtai (2016) report that the persistence of virus poses the following risks (p. 58): • transmission to others while asymptomatic (for example, sexual transmission) • reactivation of illness in the affected individual • transmission to others from symptomatic individuals with recurring illness. More studies are needed on the subject, but a range of precautions should be taken to minimize the risk or recurrence and further outbreaks, including: • the use of condoms by survivors for sexual contact for 12 months, until further research is available • testing of survivors who have positive semen on a regular basis until the virus has cleared (recommended by the WHO) • care and follow-up for survivors focusing on preventive health measures and keeping their immune system strong, e.g. managing chronic illness, ensuring vaccinations are up to date and promoting a healthy lifestyle with a nutritious diet."}

{"text": "\n## ICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 34 NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES\n\n \n## OVERVIEW\n\n Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a group of chronic diseases usually of lifetime duration and often resulting from genetic, environmental and behavioural factors. The World Health Organization estimates that NCDs account for more than 70% of deaths worldwide, predominantly in low- and middle-income countries. There are many causes and risk factors leading to the development of an NCD. Modifiable risk factors include: • tobacco use • unhealthy diet • harmful use of alcohol • air pollution. Other causes are: • urbanization • poverty • ageing • obesity. NCDs are costly to treat and often beyond the financial means of those living in low-income countries. Armed conflict and other situations of violence have resulted in millions of people having to flee their homes and become displaced. The added stress and difficult living conditions, as well as reduced access to health care,"}
{"text": "\n## OBJECTIVE\n\n To ensure the nurse is able to identify patients at risk of or suffering from an NCD and can provide high- quality care to these patients as necessary or refer them to appropriate services."}
{"text": "\n## THE ICRC’S APPROACH TO NCDS\n\n The ICRC's health strategy 2014–18 addressed the need to take a public–health approach to NCDs in armed conflict and other situations of violence. Owing to the multiple challenges where we work, the ICRC can only address NCDs that are increasingly prevalent and may result in life-threatening risks if not treated. These include cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma. The ICRC works by the following principles: • patient-centred care a continuum of care . • an integrated approach • sustainability through partnership and advocacy. ICRC NURSING GUIDELINES The ICRC's work on NCDs focuses on the following: • identifying and managing symptoms • providing essential medications and supplies to prevent complications • encouraging patients to self-manage • access to diagnostics • referral pathways general follow-up . • monitoring. The ICRC has also adapted its standard list of drugs to be in line with those of the World Health Organization and Médecins Sans Frontières."}
{"text": "\n## MANAGEMENT\n\n Management of NCDs includes prevention, detection and treatment. This is often carried out in the primary- health-care setting but can also be provided in the hospital setting."}
{"text": "\n## Cardiovascular diseases\n\n Cardiovascular diseases affect the heart and blood vessels. They are the number one cause of death world- wide. They include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms. Risk factors for cardiovascular diseases include an unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes and increased blood lipids. This can result in heart disease, heart attack or stroke. The nurse should monitor all inpatients' blood pressure. If blood pressure is high with no obvious cause, the patient may need non-medical or medical treatment and/or referral to a specialist centre."}
{"text": "\n## Chronic respiratory diseases\n\n Chronic respiratory diseases affect the airway and lungs. They include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Risk factors for respiratory disease include smoking, air pollution, allergens and occupational hazards. If a patient has trouble breathing, shortness of breath, wheezing and/or low oxygen saturation levels with no obvious cause, further investigations may be required, including chest X-ray, lung assessment and peak flow. The patient can be treated or referred elsewhere if possible."}
{"text": "\n## Diabetes\n\n Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by high levels of glucose in the blood, caused by a lack of insulin or resistance to insulin. There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2 and gestational. If untreated, diabetes can lead to serious health problems, including: infections; damage to blood vessels; neurological, kidney, eye and heart damage; ketoacidosis; and coma. Symptoms include high blood sugar, fatigue, weight loss, increased thirst and increased urination. NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES"}
{"text": "\n## NURSING CARE\n\n The nurse should be aware of the different types of NCDs that exist and the burden these illnesses can have on the patient, their family and their stay in hospital. The presence of an underlying NCD can affect a patient's healing and recovery and cause many post-operative complications. The nurse should be able to identify at-risk patients or patients who may already have an NCD. These patients may require treatment and management while in hospital or referral to other services when discharged. The nurse plays a key role in educating the patient and encouraging them to: • reduce their alcohol intake • exercise • stop smoking • lose weight • eat more fruits and vegetables • reduce their salt, sugar and fat intake • take prescribed medications • attend follow-up appointments."}

Enlist the support of mental health and psychosocial support staff if necessary. • Informed consent must always be obtained from a parent or guardian prior to surgery – see Guideline 12, on consent. • Parents/guardians should be encouraged to stay with the child for as long as possible before the operation. • Where possible, delay any invasive or traumatic procedures until the child is sedated, e.g. insertion of a nasogastric tube."}
{"text": "\n## Physical\n\n Refer to Guideline 11, on preoperative care. • Do not withhold analgesia when the patient is fasting. • An up-to-date set of vital signs should be taken and documented. • The anaesthetist is to be informed if abnormal vital signs are present. • The child should be weighed and the weight documented clearly on the patient's chart."}
{"text": "\n## Preoperative fasting\n\n Children are susceptible to hypoglycaemia and dehydration because of excessive fasting. Additionally, pro- longed fasting can cause increased stress in the child, resulting in irritability and anxiety prior to the surgery.

{"text": "\n## POST-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT\n\n See Guideline 13 , on post-operative care. • Children should be kept in a warm, calm and quiet place while recovering from surgery and anaesthesia. • Parents/guardians should be reunited with children as soon as possible. • Children should be positioned in a way to reduce post-operative discomfort. Analgesia should be given post-operatively as prescribed. . • Children should be encouraged to drink fluids once awake and, if tolerated, recommence oral feeding (unless contraindicated). • Children unable to tolerate oral fluids should be prescribed intravenous fluids to avoid dehydration. • Vital signs should be assessed regularly, and any abnormalities reported to the anaesthetist or doctor in charge."}
{"text": "\n## Ongoing care\n\n Parents/guardians should be made aware of the follow-up plan, including the frequency of dressing . changes and physiotherapy requirements. Ensure the parents/guardians are aware of and present during any procedures performed on the child. . • In the absence of a parent/guardian, a nurse should be assigned to the child. Pain relief and/or sedation should always be prescribed and given with adequate time in advance . of any painful procedure. Use age-appropriate distraction techniques during any procedure, e.g. bubble-blowing for infants . or books for older children.

{"text": "\n# ICRC NURSING GUIDELINE 38 CARING FOR A WOMAN AFTER A CAESAREAN SECTION\n\n \n## OVERVIEW\n\n A Caesarean section (C-section) is a surgical procedure performed on a pregnant woman to deliver a baby through an incision in the abdomen and uterus. This surgery requires technical expertise and a good obstetric knowledge. A C-section is associated with higher rates of maternal mortality and an increased risk of com- plications in future pregnancies. In ICRC-supported hospitals a C-section is usually performed as an emergency procedure either by an obstet- rician or a fully trained surgeon. In low-resource or conflict settings, women often present at the hospital very late in their pregnancy and may have had little or no antenatal care prior to their arrival. This can affect the health and well-being of the mother and baby. In most ICRC hospital projects where pregnant women are admitted for care and/or C-sections, the nurse should work closely with the midwife (resident or mobile) to ensure the delivery of expert care."}

It is important that all health staff members are sensitive to this and can recognize victims of sexual violence. Every victim of sexual violence should have access to private and confidential consultation and appropriate clinical medical care performed by a skilled health-care provider. The physical and psychological conse- quences of sexual violence are averted or reduced with high-quality clinical management of victims, ideally within the first 72 hours following the incident. Setting and requirements: • Carry out the clinical management of victims of sexual violence according to the principle of \"do no harm” 7 at every level of care. Guarantee respect, safety, non-discrimination, confidentiality and privacy. . Care should be given by a trained, eligible health-care provider.

(See the ICRC's Practical Guide on Reacting to Disclosure of Sexual Violence , under \"Links\".) People who have experienced sexual violence are often called either \"victims\" or \"survivors\". There are a range of 6 reasons to use each term; some prefer \"victim\" because it emphasizes that sexual violence is by nature wrong, while others see \"survivor\" as being more empowering. Because of the ICRC's focus on preventing the worst excesses of war, our publications generally use \"victim\", as this guideline does. However, it's important to keep in mind that both terms are valid and patients who have experienced sexual violence may strongly prefer one or the other. 7 \"Do no harm\" means ensuring that our operations do not result in adverse effects for those we work with. In relation to sexual violence, this means ensuring patients' safety and preventing re-traumatization (for example, by subjecting them to multiple interviews with service providers). Furthermore, to avoid stigmatization and labelling, the ICRC responds to sexual violence within a broader approach that addresses the needs of victims of all types of violence. CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF VICTIMS/SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE Treat physical injuries or refer the patient for treatment (including genital-urinary trauma and/or traumatic fistulas).

{"text": "\n## 2. Basic psychological support during medical consultation\n\n Victims of sexual and gender-based violence are often met with unfair judgement where they, not the perpetra- tors, are blamed for what happened to them. Besides the violence itself, such victim-blaming and other harmful attitudes inflict additional trauma, and they create and reinforce the stigma associated with such violence. That stigma in turn tends to create huge psychosocial barriers to seeking help for victims of sexual violence who may ned life-saving services, including urgent medical assistance, out of fear of negative repercussions from their environment. It is therefore of critical importance that medical staff do their utmost to mitigate such fears and instead foster a supportive environment in which victims feel encouraged to access the services they need for their recovery. Each member of the medical staff should therefore provide basic psychological support along with medical consultation. As in every medical consultation, health professionals should show empathy and a n-judgemental attitude and practice active listening. In doing so, you create a safe environment and build trust. Before any physical contact, always explain what is about to take place and request the patient's consent. A victim of sexual violence should never be forced to respond to questions or to accept physical examination. Such patients might need support to overcome immediate, mild psychological difficulties and to improve their immediate functioning. Moreover, the medical staff should: provide basic psychoeducation (e.g. providing information about specific psychological reactions and sharing positive coping strategies); normalize common psychological reactions to violence; and refer the patient for psychological support if they show acute need. Bear in mind that the use of a translator can hinder the progress of developing a therapeutic relationship between the health-care provider and the patient.

{"text": "\n## OVERVIEW\n\n Acute secondary health-care settings – such as surgical/weapon-wound wards in humanitarian emergencies due to armed conflict or natural disasters – are complex, busy and task-oriented environments that pose well-known challenges for health-care staff working to provide the best possible care. Under so-called nor- mal circumstances in the West, an estimated 30 to 50% of patients admitted to acute health-care settings experience comorbid physical and mental illness. Health professionals are therefore in regular contact with patients who experience mental illness as a comorbidity to a physical condition. Many studies on the topic suggest that health professionals in these non-mental-health facilities experience the complex care of these comorbid patients as among the most challenging issues in their work. In a study in Greece, nurses identified the following critical incidents as the other most challenging and emotionally demanding situations: verbal and physical violence, and acute psychotic episodes. Another complexity arises from the fact that, in many countries facing humanitarian emergencies, the general mental-health system is already poorly developed. Rarely is there the possibility of reaching a mental-health professional in a timely manner, which requires general health staff to handle these situations independently. Taking all these elements together, nurses must be as informed as possible so that they may handle acute mental–health situations safely and competently. This chapter will discuss situations in which a patient's recent or current behaviour presents a substantial risk of imminent physical or psychological harm to themselves or others. Organic causes of altered mental status must be excluded (e.g. head injury, metabolic disorders, encephal- itis). Before assuming there is a non-direct physical cause for the agitation/aggression, you should try to • high or low blood sugar electrolyte imbalance/dehydration • malaria/tuberculosis • sepsis • hypoxia • head trauma • stroke."}

{"text": "\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n To provide the most adequate support to this troubled patient population, the ICRC follows a comprehensive, stepwise approach that emphasizes preventive measures in order to impede further escalation. To be clear, the use of restraints means using force and must always be a measure of last resort to prevent imminent harm to the patient or others. This measure must only be used by health professionals in self- Means of restraint are security measures and have no therapeutic justification. Health professionals applying these measures must also be aware that, if the principles below are not respected, their use can amount to ill treatment prohibited under international and professional standards, 8 and it can exacerbate harm or pre- existing discrimination, in particular against people with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities. Any type of restraint and the rationale for its use should have a basis in law and be necessary as well as pro- portionate. 9 Any restraint should be used for the shortest possible time, and a mental-health professional must be involved as soon as possible to initiate specialized treatment or referral to a specialized service. In addition, the patient should be informed of the sequence of actions which will be undertaken. By receiving information about what will follow, the patient can be more prepared and less anxious while maintaining maximum control. Every use of restraints should always be expressly ordered by a doctor after an individual assessment and be clearly stated in the patient file, particularly if the doctor is not present at the facility 24/7. Generally, any measure taken by a health-care professional requires informed consent. However, in a situ- ation where there is a real, imminent threat of the patient hurting themselves or others, this principle can For example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Convention against Torture and Convention 8 on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Use of a restraint can be considered \"necessary\" only when all other non-violent measures have been exhausted, 9 i.e. when other, less intrusive measures have been ineffective or would not achieve the objective of preventing or minimizing the substantial risk of imminent physical or psychological harm to the person or others. Use of the restraint must also be restricted to the minimum intensity necessary to attain that objective. Finally, use of the restraint must be temporally limited, i.e. only lasting as long as the circumstances making it necessary persist, and no longer. Use of a restraint can be considered \"proportionate\" only when the benefits of its use (preventing or minimizing imminent harm to the person or others, gauged by the seriousness of the threat posed and the importance of preventing or minimizing such harm) are balanced against its anticipated harm (e.g. potential exacerbation of the individual's mental state or negative longer-term impact on the relationship between the patient and the health staff applying the measure). If the anticipated harm outweighs the potential benefits, use of a restraint would be disproportionate. MANAGING ACUTE MENTAL-HEALTH EMERGENCIES THAT PRESENT IMMINENT HARM"}
{"text": "\n## ASSESSMENT – GENERAL\n\n Central to any intervention is a risk assessment of the patient's current mental state. Risk assessment and management is a complex process involving both objective data (such as the patient's history and behaviour) and the judgement of the clinicians involved. There are only a few, if any, properly validated risk-assessment tools available and the clinical judgement of an experienced mental-health professional still plays the cen- tral role overall. Nevertheless, there is a set of recommendations that will help guide less-experienced staff carrying out a risk assessment (see \"Management\", below). One key element of any sound risk assessment is an open and in-depth dialogue between all members of the clinical team and other parties as appropriate, including relatives, care providers and the patient themselves. The other key element is that the risk assessment is a dynamic process that requires constant review. Ideally the members of a multidisciplinary team would always make decisions together; however, on many occa- sions (particularly weekends and evenings) decisions may have to be made by a doctor and the ward nursing team (or even the nurse alone). Such decisions should always be reviewed as soon as possible with more of te team."}
{"text": "\n## ASSESSMENT – SELF-HARM/SUICIDAL IDEATION\n\n The risk assessment for self-harming behaviour is probably among the most difficult tasks in mental-health care, as the wrong judgement can lead to death. As a result, staff often take more restrictive measures to avoid shouldering this burden. Is all self-harm done with the intention of killing oneself? This question represents one of the most import- ant elements to consider. The clear answer is no, but as in so many other critical issues there is sometimes a blurry line, the uncertainty of which places an emotional burden on the assessor. The two main categories of self-harm can be roughly expressed as: 1. self-harm with the intention to relieve emotional tension/discomfort 2. self-harm with the intention to terminate one's life. It is important to understand the different dynamics behind these two categories, as they play a crucial role in the risk assessment of a self-harming person. The first category can generally be seen as a poor/unhealthy coping mechanism. We are all familiar with moments in which we feel emotional pain that hurts so much that we just want it to stop. Almost all of us develop coping mechanisms that dictate how we act in such moments to alleviate the feeling, which can range from going running or meditating to getting drunk or using other psychoactive substances. In order not to judge others by your own experiences, you must be aware that emotional distress/tension is produced, perceived and experienced differently in each individual. While one person may be a bit sad when a friend is angry at them, another may enter into an emotional crisis; while one person will talk with other loved ones to handle the sadness, another person will withdraw and isolate themselves for a couple of days. A frequent indicator that you are dealing with an emotionally unstable person is that the care team is split – some are seriously concerned while others say that the person is just playing or pretending. As mentioned before, determining whether someone is suicidal or not is a complex endeavour and includes many elements that need to be taken into account. In addition, it represents a time-consuming task, perhaps taking several hours for an adequate analysis. Whenever there is a mental-health professional at a reachable distance, this person should immediately be involved when self-harm has happened. That is the clear first step, and non-mental-health professionals are discouraged from trying it out because they think it is nothing serious and believe they can handle themselves. ICRC NURSING GUIDELINES"}
{"text": "\n## MANAGEMENT\n\n Caring for people experiencing periods of acute mental illness or distress is challenging and demanding – experiencing it must be even more difficult. Comprehensive care involves both ensuring the safety of the patients and those around them and offering therapeutic help and support. One without the other is incom- plete. The risk is that services pay considerable attention to the safety component but much less to reducing harm to the patient in the most humane way. To ensure both, staff must feel valued and supported and given the time and skills to truly engage with the patient. The process must be a partnership approach between staff and the patient where the needs of the patient are recognized and respected. There is much one group can Nurses are the most likely to be first in line when patients or their relatives become aggressive and possibly violent. Every nurse should develop skills in verbal de-escalation, both for the purposes of nursing and for their own protection. A five-minute de-escalation intervention before things get out of hand is by far the most preferable and least harmful choice for handling a potentially violent situation. In contrast, the use of physical restraints, which is traumatic for patients and emotionally burdensome for staff, should always be the very last resort. When faced with potentially imminent violence, the instinctive human response is fight or flight, but neither of these actions is suitable for the health-care setting, where nurses have a duty of care. Using the following techniques to deal with aggressive behaviour can usually turn the situation around and avoid a critical incident, which is the worst outcome for everyone involved (including bystanders). It is critical that a self-harm/suicidal ideation risk assessment be done with a holistic view of the patient and their care; it should not be based only on the immediate circumstances. Nevertheless, the best and most important measure is prevention, as every acute mental-health emergency is stressful, even if you manage in the best possible way. mprehensive approach to handle acute-emergency mental health situations should include the following elements"}
{"text": "\n## 1. Prevention\n\n At the beginning of a project/programme you should examine the premises with the whole team and think through a situation in which you might be faced with a violent or suicidal patient. Try at the very beginning to put in place standard operating procedures that you can follow once you are faced with such a patient. Ideally there would be a room that could be used as a retreat or, worst-case scenario, for seclusion, isolation The more you know about a patient, the better you will be able to predict the seriousness of a violent or self-harming act. As an example: If you notice old superficial scars on their arms or legs, which are usually straight and arranged in parallel to each other, you should be aware (and ideally have the patient confirm) that they have used shallow cutting to release emotional tension. This should be noted in the patient file and pointed out to the other health personnel dealing with the patient. Without having to do a professional per- sonality analysis, you should be able to judge whether the person is calm and rational or rather impulsive and emotional by nature. Clearly, the second type deserves more attention and caution regarding self-harm as a means of relieving emotional tension. When doing ward rounds, these aspects should always be considered, and if there are signs of emotional distress, immediate preventive measures should be taken in line with that increased attention and caution. The more you know about your patient, the better relationship you have with them, and the more attentive you are to patients identified as being at risk, the less you will encounter acute situations This significantly reduces the burden of such incidents on everyone involved. MANAGING ACUTE MENTAL-HEALTH EMERGENCIES THAT PRESENT IMMINENT HARM"}
{"text": "\n## 2. Prediction\n\n One of the main goals is to be able to predict when a person is on the way to becoming violent or self- harming/suicidal. The most valuable element is, as mentioned, knowing the patient. The better you know them, the better you will be able to recognize subtle signs that tell you something is not right. Any change should raise your attention, as there is usually a reason for such changes (excepting the little daily swings that would be categorized as general behaviour). If a patient presents with depressive symptoms and you know that the person talks little and leaves the room only once a day, then you should be alert when the person doesn't speak at all anymore one day or doesn't leave the room even once. These little disturbances of a daily routine seem negligible, but many times they represent the first steps towards further deterioration."}
{"text": "\n## Remember:\nThe best indicator is a change from regular behaviour.\n\n If you have not had a chance to get to know a patient better or the person just recently arrived, below are some signs separated by category that should help better predict the level of danger."}

{"text": "\n## 3. De-escalation\n\n Concerning de-escalation, we need to look at three scenarios separately."}
{"text": "\n## Aggression/agitation\n\n a)   Find a safe environment. If possible, try to move the person away from other people to an environment where they can feel safe and yu are also safe. b)   Position yourself correctly. Stand in a position of safety – usually between the person and the doorway, but not directly in front of the door so that the individual still has an escape route. Our first reaction as nurses is to move towards patients, offering a comforting touch. However, respect for personal space is vital when dealing with aggressive behav- iour, as the invasion of this space can increase the level of anxiety. Stay at least two arm's-lengths away from the person. This also puts you out of reach of assault by either hitting or kicking and gives you space to evade or ward off an actual attack. Avoid facing the person in a full-frontal position because this is an aggressive stance and might be inter- preted as confrontation. Stand slightly to the side and at an angle. Adopt a relaxed posture, arms at your sides with your hands open and facing the person. One to 1.5 metres is generally a good distance to stay at. c)   Be calm and respectful. The aggressive person who has lost control over rational thought is more attuned to non-verbal cues than to what you might be saying. Even though, on the inside, you might feel terrified or ready to lash out, you must maintain a calm demeanour through your gestures, facial expressions, movements and (especially) tone of voice. Through eye contact and non-threatening body language, demonstrate that you are giving the person your full attention and are interested in their problem and not another threat. d)  Use principles of therapeutic communication. Listen intently to what the person is saying, including for what the real reason for the individual's behaviour might be. Listen to the feelings behind what the person is actually complaining about. A relative might lash out at staff because of underlying fear and concern for a loved one. If possible, allow verbal venting, as this is often when the actual issue becomes evident. Validate the person's feelings by demonstrating through your response that you can imagine how they feel. Show non-judgemental acceptance and respect. Although you might believe that the person's feelings are not valid, they are very real to the person. Allow pauses to occur because this will lower the level of confrontation as well as enable the person to think about their response. Reflect the person's words back by summarizing and expressing what you believe the person has said and then allowing them to confirm or explain further. This shows that you want to really understand the situation so that the problem can be addressed. Ignore slights against the health–care centre or you personally, such as \"who do you think you are to tell me that\". Responding defensively will only lead to arguments. Lead the conversation back to the central issue at hand. You are the wise one in these moments! MANAGING ACUTE MENTAL-HEALTH EMERGENCIES THAT PRESENT IMMINENT HARM Once the situation has been defused and the person is calmer, rational communication will be possible. The next step is to try to find an acceptable resolution to the problem. Set clear limits, provide necessary infor- mation concisely and, where possible, offer choices that will give the person some sense of control over the situation. A break of five to ten minutes to relax before re-engaging could help create a conducive environ- ment. This process should be attempted several times before escalating to the next step."}
{"text": "\n## Non-suicidal self-harm with an emotional-impulsive person\n\n When dealing with an emotional and impulsive person, your main aim should be to balance their emotionality and provide alternative coping mechanisms to self-harm. It is crucial to get the patient's agreement that they will alert the nurses when they feel emotional tension rising. Usually you would develop an individual toolset dependent on the severity level, which the person can use in order to reduce tension. As many of these nor- mally include activities that demand personal initiative and proactivity, patients who have been operated on and are physically limited in a secondary health-care facility, will unfortunately depend on the active support of health staff or relatives in these moments. Follow these general steps: 1) Listen and try to understand what is going on 2) Try to reduce/eliminate distress 3) Give tranquilizing medication 4) Carry out protocol-led close, frequent observation 5) Use physical intervention * Depending on your time, numbers three and four can be reversed. If you are not too busy, you may decide to increase observation before giving medication. If you are very busy, you may choose to medicate earlier, before you miss an escalation in the patient's behaviour owing to less time for close attention. The first level of de-escalation should always include listening and trying to understand what is going on. To get a good understanding it is crucial to distinguish between something chronic, something new and some- thing that happens every once in a while. Once you understood the main reason for the current increase in emotional tension, try to eliminate it. If you cannot, you should try to identify other possible strategies for self-soothing. There is nothing that works for everybody. It is much more important to identify what coping mechanisms the person has used and that work for them. Listening to music might help one person, while it might cause others to fall into deeper melan- cholia and disturbing rumination. Television might be a good distracter, if they like watching it. Techniques like dropping lemon drops on your tongue aim to induce a strong physical sensation might distract you from focusing on your emotions. Other senses, such as smell, can also help. Relaxation techniques such as pro- gressive muscle relaxation can be very useful and should be used if someone in the team is educated in them. In general, your main aim at this stage is to overcome a difficult moment. There is a good chance that, after a while, the person will pass the emotional peak and overcome the situation as time passes and they get distracted or calm down after the cause of their distress has been eliminated.

{"text": "\n## 4. Increased observation: Self-harm with suicidal intent\n\n If you are faced with a person who wants to commit suicide, your first step is usually to increase your obser- vation frequency and position the person where you can keep a constant eye on them. If that is not possible with existing resources, you should always consider having a family member watch them or hiring a daily worker or student in order to avoid scaling up to the last resort of physical restraint. Investment at this stage is worth it, considering the mental harm entailed by reaching the next stage."}
{"text": "\n## 5. Rapid tranquilizers\n\n If you cannot eliminate the distressing factor and the mechanisms above do not work, you may offer a tranquilizing medication, especially considering our resource-limited environment. There is generally noth- ing wrong with using, for example, a benzodiazepine to help someone overcome an emotionally troubling moment just as it can be used for inducing sleep in cases of insomnia. It is important to be aware that benzo- diazepines have a high potential for addiction. Therefore, they should be used only when necessary, and, above all else, the patient must be informed of this danger and reduce or stop the medication as soon as it does not seem necessary anymore. How long can you administer a benzodiazepine before a person develops an addiction? There is no clear cut-off, and this threshold usually depends on many individual characteristics. A very safe estimate: With constant use of short-acting benzodiazepines, such as midazolam, addiction symptoms can appear after one to two weeks. With the usually used longer-acting benzodiazepines, such as diazepam or lorazepam, this timeframe expands to one to two months or more. Giving a benzodiazepine for a week should not worry you much. The consequences of not being able to calm somebody down can be much more severe than the use of a medication. Using a benzodiazepine for a week will not create addiction. But if a patient keeps demanding it, be careful and discuss with"}

If the agitation is already extreme, gets worse or includes psychotic symptoms like delusion or hallucinations, start or switch to haloperidol; give 5 mg. If after 20 to 30 minutes you see no or minimal effect, give another 5 mg. You can go up to 100 mg orally per 24 hours. You can use another anti-psychotic instead, such as risperidone (in the ICRC's list of medications). Start with 1 to 2 mg, depending on level of agitation. You can go up to 8 mg per 24 hours."}

The best option you have is 5 mg of halo- peridol. If after 20 to 30 minutes you see no improvement, give another 5 mg injection. You can go up to 60 mg per 24 hours. When you are faced with chronic underlying aggression, your best option is risperidone, 1 to 2 mg per day. You can distribute the dosage into morning and evening doses, depending on the daily cycle of the aggression. The most humane way to give an injection and ensure minimum harm is for five people to immobilize the person – one for \neach limb and one holding their head.

{"text": "\n## 6. Physical intervention\n\n Physical interventions, like holding back a person, injecting medication against their will or applying physical restraints like handcuffs, should be the last resort, used only in case of emergency, after all the previously described measures have been exhausted and when there appears to be an imminent threat of harm to the patient or others. The use of force in self-defence or in defence of others must be necessary and proportional. That means the measures must be reasonable given the circumstances and must be used to the minimum degree necessary to prevent harm. Physical interventions need to be followed by appropriate documentation that describes the situation and justifies the intervention in terms of necessity and proportionality."}
{"text": "\n## In addition…\n\n The use of restraints must adhere to local and hospital policy and you should check what the law . in the host country is. If there is none, make sure to write down standard operating procedures that provide for all available alternatives to using restraints and detail with precision the exceptional circumstances and modalities, including regular review, under which restraints may be used for the shortest possible duration. Staff members must receive proper training before applying physical restraints. The reason for and process of using restraints must be explained to the patient and their family . Wrist and ankle restraints can be used with padding. They should be released every two hours, . and the patient's skin and neurovascular status must be checked. • Document the use of restraint in patient notes. Physical restraint is the final stage of escalation, where you would feel acutely uncomfortable leaving the person alone. During the day, there is the possibility of wrapping up a person in a bed sheet. Wrapping agi- tated people in a sheet- or towel-like fabric can lead to a quick reduction of agitation. Once you have reached this stage, you probably have already admitted tranquilizers. In order to ensure the containment of a severely agitated patient, they should usually be given an accompanying medication (either orally, if possible, or per intramuscular injection) up to the level of risperidone (orally) or haloperidol (intramuscularly).

There are seldom perfect incident procedures, and there will always be room for improvement. If you start blaming each other inside the team, you will not reach a satisfactory consensus of how to handle these difficult, complex moments."}

If the patient comes in a car or ambulance, leave them in the vehicle and ensure the vehicle is parked . far away from the hospital, at least 300 m. . If the patient is walking, accommodate them in a room or area at least 300 m away. The room should have concrete walls; if this is not available, the area should be surrounded by sandbags. Call the ICRC WEC expert in the country if possible. If not, call the ICRC regional WEC expert, . and if possible also call the local explosive ordnance disposal team/army/police. ICRC NURSING GUIDELINES Phone waves could trigger the latest generation of bomb fuses. Never use a phone near UXO. Turn . mobile phones to airplane mode and take a few photos of the front and back of the device. Once you have removed yourself to a safe distance from the patient and it is safe enough to reactivate the phone, send the photos to the WEC expert. The WEC expert will be able to tell from the photos whether the device is active or not and will inform . you about what safe procedures to adopt. If the device is not active and the WEC expert advises that it is safe, insert an intravenous line; give . intravenous fluids, analgesia and antibiotics; then leave the patient but continue to have visual contact with them from a safe distance (so they can communicate if needed). • Only one person should attend to the patient. • The surgeon and anaesthetist together with the WEC expert will need to surgically remove the device under a general anaesthetic to prevent the patient from moving. After the induction of general anaesthesia and once the patient is on the ventilator (if available), the anaesthetist should leave the room to reduce the number of staff members exposed to any risk. Once the device has been removed, patient care can continue as normal. The WEC expert will take charge of the device and safely remove it from the hospital. If the WEC expert . is not physically present in the hospital, they will give advice over the phone on how to manage the device post-operatively. It is important to remain in constant contact with WEC during the entire process. If the patient's condition is life-threatening and the device is active, you cannot touch the patient. . Do not attempt CPR or defibrillation, as any movement will activate the device. The patient must be left alone, even if this is fatal. The danger to everyone is too great to attempt heroic gestures. • In all cases, remain calm, consult with WEC immediately and follow their advice. Patients presenting to the hospital after a CBRN attack: • Do not bring the patient into the hospital or ward. • Do not touch the patient. • If available send the patient to the decontamination shower; if this is not available a normal shower or bucket with water and soap is sufficient. Ensure they have soap. • Instruct the patient to remove all clothes and underwear. • Use appropriate personal protective equipment to safely dispose of contaminated clothing per the advice of the WEC expert. Instruct the patient to wash with soap and water all areas of their body, including skin folds, genitals . and hair. Instruct them to tilt their head back in order to protect their eyes and airway. • Once the patient has showered, you must check their skin pH: Get a urinalysis dipstick and ask the patient to place it on their skin. The pH should be above 7.2; if the pH is under 7.2, the patient needs to shower again. • In a life-threatening situation, the patient cannot shower and therefore remains contaminated. The patient cannot therefore be touched by staff, and this usually means that their condition is fatal. • If a nerve agent was used, check whether an antidote is available – atropine and pralidoxime is the antidote for all nerve agents. For a cyanide attack, check whether the facility has a cyanide antidote kit. The patient will die quickly . without the antidote. There is no antidote for chlorine or mustard gas. The patient needs to have a decontamination shower, . and then the nurse should provide supportive care."}

In situations of armed conflict, violence perpetrated by the parties to the conflict (either State armed forces or non-State armed groups) against health-care providers delivering health care is considered a violation of international humanitarian law because health-care facilities, providers, patients and vehicles are specific- ally protected under international humanitarian law. Nevertheless, in places where there is no armed conflict, health-care providers, facilities, patients, etc. are protected under international human rights law, as it is the right of all people to access non-discriminatory, adequate and timely healthcare.

{"text": "\n## 1.1 Differences between surgery in times of conflict and civilian practice\n\n The differences between civilian and war trauma are manifold – as are the differences between the experience of the ICRC and those of conventional military Most surgeons today, the world over, derive their trauma training from road-traffic accidents and much that applies to the management of casualties in civilian settings will also apply to the situation of armed conflict: war surgery follows classical surgical standards. However, the generation of surgeons who mostly had to deal with accidents among agricultural or industrial workers were well aware of the dangers of gas gangrene and tetanus and the necessity of good wound excision and delayed primary closure. It was relatively easy for the surgeon to shift from this “septic” civilian surgery to war wounds. This is no longer the case for many surgeons trained today; laparoscopy, radioscopic embolization, and unreamed intramedullary nails will not get you very far when facing a landmine injury of the abdomen or a machine-gun wound to the thigh. Early specialist training of surgeons and sophisticated modern technology benefit many patients in a peacetime environment, but can be an obstacle to the practice of surgery during armed conflict. War wounds are different. The extent of tissue destruction and contamination seen in war injuries is nothing like what is seen in everyday trauma practice. Working conditions during war are radically different from those prevailing in peacetime. Resources are limited and surgeons are often obliged to improvise or make compromises in their management decisions. Their aim should be to bring the best care possible to their patients under the circumstances, not the best care as described in the academic literature. War surgery is a surgery of mass casualties. The logic of war triage has little to do with the routine emergency department triage of a major civilian trauma centre: war triage has a \"leave to die in dignity\" category unheard of in everyday civilian practice. War surgery involves the staged surgical management of the wounded, often at different echelons of care and provided by different surgeons, especially in a military context. Even in a humanitarian context, such as ICRC surgical programmes, several surgeons deployed on short missions may participate in the treatment of a single patient. In everyday civilian practice on the other hand, the same surgeon assumes responsibility for the entire surgical management of his or her patient. While modern civilian practice often involves a \"multidisciplinary approach\", war surgery often demands a “multi-surgeon” approach. civilian concepts of traumatic surgery.\" Michael E.

{"text": "\n## 1.2.1 IHL: protection of non-combatants and those “hors de combat” and the rights and obligations of medical personnel\n\n The Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols of 1977 define categories of individuals who, by virtue of these treaties, are protected during armed conflict. These include non-combatants, combatants who no longer participate in hostilities – \"hors de combat\" – either through sickness, injury, shipwreck, or by becoming prisoners of war; and those who care for the sick and injured, namely medical and religious personnel. The latter two use the protective emblem of the red cross, red crescent or red crystal to mark the means and facilities that take care of the sick and wounded. According to the law, all these categories of protected individuals are immune from attack, as long as they do not take an active part in hostilities. International humanitarian law – the law of war – offers particular rights to medical personnel, but also ascribes obligations to them. All health professionals are bound by medical ethics, in times of peace and of war. These are not replaced but are complemented by international humanitarian law. Compliance with these laws may create particular ethical dilemmas and security problems, and the military hierarchy does not always understand the demands of medical ethics. Civilian health staff may face particularly problematic and dangerous situations during a civil war where their own community is involved in the conflict.

{"text": "\n## 1.2.4\n\n \n## Surgery in a limited technical environment\n\n The environment in times of war is bleak and harsh. The limits of surgical work are largely determined by the logistic difficulties attending the supply of remote and dangerous areas and the lack of maintenance, repair and spare parts. There is seldom enough technical support staff to ensure that infrastructure functions correctly. Figure 1.4 Surgery in a limited technical environment. Despite lavish outlays for field hospitals by the armies of modern industrialized countries, equipment limitations in tactical situations are well recognized. The lack of sophisticated diagnostic equipment rather than the surgeon's technical capabilities and expertise is often what determines what can be done. What is essential must be differentiated from what is “nice to have”."}
{"text": "\n## 1.2.5 Surgery in a hostile, violent environment\n\n The adverse conditions of a tactical situation may put the safety of patients and medical personnel at risk, and thereby create less than optimal working conditions. Dangerous evacuation routes may compromise transport and result in delays. Security must be ensured for patients and staff, by selecting suitable sites for first-aid posts and hospitals. Health facilities and ambulances should be clearly marked with the protective emblem of the red cross, red crescent or red crystal, according to the dictates of international humanitarian law. Not all combatants are disciplined and well trained. For anyone caught up in armed conflict, there is an all too familiar syndrome seen amongst young fighting men who are under the influence of a \"toxic cocktail\": testosterone, adrenaline, alcohol and cannabis (and, at times, “other substances” as well). Figure 1.5 Working in a hostile environment. WAR SURGERY Figure 1.6 Mass casualties: the principles of triage. The setting of surgical work can change rapidly, and surgeons must be prepared to adapt to various difficult and austere environments. With few doctors and limited staff available, and wounded people pouring in, hospital facilities are easily overwhelmed. Doctors and nurses also get tired and sick, and are sometimes frightened. The physical and mental strain of working in new and strange circumstances and at times Much has been written about the carnage of the major wars of the twentieth century, and the role of triage in the management of thousands of casualties resulting from a single battle. These lessons are still relevant in contemporary conflicts. The logic followed must be to \"do the best for the most\" and not \"everything for everyone\". This involves the most important change in the professional mindset of the surgeon. Triage decisions are amongst the most difficult in all medical practice, possibly creating ethical dilemmas. There may also be, at times, a conflict between medical criteria and tactical ones of military necessity that require some form of compromise. Persons performing triage must be prepared to accept these necessary compromises while maintaining their professional medical integrity (see Chapter 9)."}
{"text": "\n## 1.2.7\n\n \n## Triage and surgery in successive echelons\n\n The sick and wounded are evacuated and transferred along a chain of casualty care. The principles of triage are applied at every stage in this chain. The initial surgery must not compromise the performance of later, definitive surgery. The prognosis will be much better if the wounded are evacuated rapidly to a higher echelon hospital structure. A surgeon in the field must understand the system and know what will happen to the patient at the next echelon of care and what is required of him at his echelon (see Chapter 6). War surgery requires a logic of phased wound management. Treatment takes place in five phases often, although not necessarily, in five different places. This is the classical set-up in military planning. It involves high costs, including the means of transportation and the discipline required of such organization. Modern concepts can be integrated into this approach, such as forward surgical teams performing damage- control surgery. The five phases are as follows. 1. First aid at the point of wounding: self- or \"buddy\" treatment, or that provided by a field medical officer or first aider. 2. First medical treatment: vital emergency measures including the beginning of resus- citation, generally at the first-aid or dressing post, clearing station or collection point. 3. First surgical treatment: debridement/wound excision, without primary closure, at the first echelon hospital. 4. Definitive treatment: delayed primary closure of wounds and surgical treatment according to traditional principles in a referral hospital. Physiotherapy and c onvalescence. 5. Reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation: specialized surgery with multiple reconstructive procedures and the fitting of prostheses when required. The rapid turnover of medical personnel treating numerous patients at different points in a chain of casualty care creates a necessity for standard protocols, which cannot be left to the discretion or whim of the individual surgeon. One cannot individualize treatment for each single patient in a tactical situation; different surgeons will operate on the same patient at the different echelons. In civilian practice, by contrast, the same surgeon manages the surgical care of the individual patient throughout that patient’s course of treatment; even in a multidisciplinary approach, the same team is involved. SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SURGERY IN TIMES OF CONFLICT These five echelons for the management of the war-wounded do not always exist in a civilian or humanitarian context, where all five phases may well occur in the same medical facility – as is in fact common practice for ICRC hospital teams. However, in the humanitarian context, there is also a rapid turnover of personnel. Standardized protocols are the only means to ensure continuity of treatment and to organize surgical and nursing care on a sound footing; the protocols cannot be changed with every change of team surgeon."}

{"text": "\n## 1.2.9  Specific wound pathology: bullets, bombs, blast, and non-conventional weapons\n\n War wounds are qualitatively different from trauma seen in civilian practice: all are dirty and contaminated. Projectiles may cause massive destruction of soft tissues, bones, and important organs. Infection is the great danger and the rules of septic surgery apply (see Chapters 3 and 13).  Old lessons for new surgeons   War wounds are dirty and contaminated from the moment  of injury. The rules of septic surgery apply. Nothing in routine civilian practice is similar to the polytrauma of multiple shell fragments, traumatic amputation due to an anti-personnel landmine, or the devastating effects of a high-kinetic energy transfer from a military rifle bullet. Again, a change in the professional mindset appropriate to a modern trauma centre is required in order to adjust to the management of wounds in times of armed conflict. Surgeons practising in a low-income country, dealing with much septic pathology, will find this change much easier to handle than those whose usual work involves sophisticated technology with abundant good nursing care in an aseptic environment."}
{"text": "\n## 1.2.10 Specific techniques appropriate to the context and pathology\n\n The care of numerous patients, treated in many locations by different surgeons, in austere conditions demands simplicity, security, and speed of surgical procedures. The need for speed in dealing with mass casualties with inadequate numbers of staff should not lead to confusion and disorder. Phased wound care imposes standards and a systematic approach: doing the least amount of surgical work for the greatest results, saving “life and limb”, and then sending the patient on to the next stage in the chain of casualty care. The follow-up of surgical procedures by the individual surgeon in the field is difficult if not impossible, and precludes personal and individualistic techniques. Standard protocols, as mentioned, are necessary. The majority of wounds will be to the extremities, and the objective is to treat them so that they heal as quickly as possible without becoming infected. Sepsis, potentially fatal (tetanus, gas gangrene, haemolytic septicaemia), is the greatest danger for survivors. As aforesaid: the rules of septic surgery apply. The basic principles of management of war wounds comprise the following steps. 1. Early and thorough wound excision and irrigation. 2. Adequate wound drainage. 3. No unnecessary dressing changes. 4. Delayed primary closure. 5. Antibiotics as an adjuvant. 6. Anti-tetanus vaccine and immunoglobulin if necessary. 7. No internal bone fixation. 4 4 No internal bone fixation is the rule, at least in the \"acute phase\". Recent experience has shown the possibility of using internal fixation once the soft tissues have healed in the absence of any infection, but only in skilled hands and with excellent conditions of hygiene and nursing care. This is not, however, standard policy in ICRC practice where no internal fixation whatsoever is used. The risk, and probability, of abuse of internal fixation precludes its availability.

{"text": "\n## 1.2.11 Increased prevalence of endemic disease\n\n Until World War I, more soldiers died of disease than of their wounds. Battle-injury attrition was usually around 20%, and disease four times more common among soldiers. Non-battle injury attrition rates remain very high even today; infectious and communicable diseases differ according to the geography and climate, but psychological disorders and vehicle accidents are universal. The destruction, disruption and disorganization that accompany armed conflict often cause the public health system to be among the very first to suffer. The humanitarian consequences translate into reduced availability of basic public health requirements such as water, food, shelter, etc., for the civilian population and often overwhelm the capacities of the public health system. This compounds the challenge of caring for the civilian population in a conflict zone: i.e. residents, internally displaced persons, and refugees fleeing to or from neighbouring countries (see Chapter 5)."}
{"text": "\n## 1.3\n\n \n## “Surgeries” for victims of war\n\n There is more than one type of war surgery. While the needs of the wounded are the same, the means and resources available to meet those needs vary widely from country to country and situation to situation, giving rise to different approaches to war surgery. The management of the war-wounded as performed by the military medical services of an industrialized country is not the same as that of a public rural hospital in a low-income country. Although the principles of wound management are the same in both cases, the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities are very different. The latter should be appropriate to the technological, financial, and human resources at hand. Obviously many of these same constraints apply to the practice of civilian, everyday trauma and elective  surgery around the world. At least four major scenarios for the surgical management of victims of war in contemporary armed conflicts can be described. 1. Conventional army of an industrialized society, with a high level of public financing and where the military attempt to provide the same level of surgical care that is practised in civilian life. Rapid evacuation and transfer of patients to specialized facilities is routine. Safe access to adequate medical care for the sick and wounded is perceived as a right; and the duty to provide it incumbent on the armed forces.  Developing country with an emergent economy where, at least in the capital 2. and other major cities, a high-level of specialized surgical care including enough trained personnel is available, even if this is not the case in rural areas. Evacuation and transfer of patients to specialized facilities is possible, if sometimes difficult. Safe access to adequate medical care is a goal to be achieved.  WAR SURGERY 3. Poor country, with limited financial and human resources. A few major surgical centres may exist in the capital city but provincial and rural hospitals are largely staffed by young general surgeons or general practitioners with some surgical experience. Supplies, budgets, and human resources are chronically inadequate or even absent. Evacuation and transfer of patients are difficult or impossible. Safe access to adequate medical care is rarely guaranteed. 4. Non-State actors, guerrilla groups, populations without safe access to public structures. Field surgery is practised by a few trained doctors and nurses, because there is no alternative. Safe access to the victims by health professionals, and the victims’ access to medical care, is impossible or rare, problematic, and always a challenge. structures.

Besides the direct victims, the ICRC also attempts to support the health system by assisting local medical colleagues to maintain the infrastructure and human resources necessary to resume functioning after the end of the conflict, thus providing the civilian population with at least the basics of healthcare. ICRC assistance to local structures may involve construction and renovation of health facilities, water and sanitation work, food supplements for patients and staff, equipment, supplies and basic salaries. Training programmes for doctors and nurses may be included. In addition, the ICRC may at times set up its own independent hospitals with expatriate staff supplemented by local personnel (see Chapter 6)."}
{"text": "\n## 1.4.1\n\n \n## Military-civilian cooperation\n\n Armed forces deployed in the field have a specific military mission. Their medical component aims primarily to give support to their soldiers in this mission, i.e. to achieve their tactical and strategic plans. The military may have many of the same \"assistance and reconstruction\" aims as civilian organizations, but medical criteria in a military context often must take second place to the tactical and strategic demands of military and political necessity. The ICRC is a neutral, impartial and independent, totally humanitarian, institution. It promotes adherence to international humanitarian law and aims to protect and assist the victims of conflict – all the victims on all sides. Any cooperation with armies in the field of battle that compromises the perception of that neutrality, impartiality or independence can only compromise the humanitarian work of the ICRC, as well as that of other organizations and agencies. The ICRC insists on maintaining its independence, and the independence of a \"humanitarian space\" separate from the \"assistance and reconstruction\" work of armies in the field. Many humanitarian organizations share the same opinion and approach."}
{"text": "\n## 1.4.2 Constraints: security\n\n The ICRC often has little or no control over casualty evacuation because of security constraints. In many countries the wounded are transported by private means: taxis, donkeys, oxcarts or on foot. In some contexts, the ICRC has been able to set up first- aid posts, or assist a National Red Cross or Red Crescent Society in doing so. One extraordinary example was a 16-year medical evacuation system by fixed-wing aircraft run by the ICRC and United Nations’ Operation Lifeline Sudan to assist victims of the conflict in southern Sudan: it transported over 30,000 sick and wounded patients to an ICRC hospital in northern Kenya. Even with aircraft available, the logistics and distances involved regularly resulted in a one- to three-week delay in evacuation. While the armed forces deploy the necessary means to protect their health facilities from the \"lethal chaos of the battlefield\", 5 the ICRC depends on the red cross emblem and negotiations with all belligerent forces for its physical protection. The ICRC has no guns to protect itself and is just as dependent on local authorities and leaders as public hospitals are. The ICRC relies on the limits imposed by international humanitarian law and the discipline of combatants, and its diplomatic negotiating ability. Other humanitarian organizations who work in war zones face similar constraints. 5 Butler F. Tactical Combat Casualty Care: combining good medicine with good tactics.

{"text": "\n## Constraints: logistics 1.4.3\n\n A hostile environment presents more than security risks. Remote areas with dangerous routes and extreme climates pose numerous logistic problems for the delivery of supplies and the maintenance of basic infrastructure, for both hospital and living quarters. The military often have lift, delivery and transport capacities that civilian institutions lack. Although the armed forces also have their logistic limits, they are of a different order of magnitude to those of the health ministry, non- governmental organizations, or the ICRC. Figure 1.10 Challenging environment."}
{"text": "\n## 1.4.4 Constraints: hospital equipment\n\n These limitations also affect hospital equipment. The military have lift constraints because they must also transport arms and munitions. For the ICRC, equipment limitations mean resorting to appropriate technology and mastering the tasks of maintenance, repair and availability of spare parts. This is particularly important when working in remote areas in a poor country with training programmes for local colleagues. The aim is to avoid creating a technological dependency that the permanent local staff will not be able to cope with when the conflict is over, and the ICRC leaves the hospital and the country. To this end, the ICRC has developed criteria for the introduction of any new technology into its standard list of medicines and equipment for hospital programmes (see Annexe 1. A: ICRC criteria for introducing a new technology). Figure 1.11 Limited surgical equipment. SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SURGERY IN TIMES OF CONFLICT A standard list is a basic, limited set of essential supplies, both medical and non- medical, which corresponds to an appropriate standard of care. All items on a standard list should always be available from a central store or reliable supplier. Standardization provides a simple framework, within which resources can be used to maximum effect, promotes continuity in patient care, helps to simplify staff training, and makes it easier to introduce new and inexperienced staff into the system. The ICRC and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have established an Emergency Items Catalogue 6 with predetermined sets and kits that run the gamut of assistance programmes. ICRC experience shows that it is possible to perform good quality surgery with basic technology such as simple X-ray, and electronic monitoring in the theatre and post-operative ward limited to a pulse oxymeter. An ICRC laboratory set-up is also basic; there is no capacity for bacteriological culture and sensitivity and no blood components."}

The wounded may suffer from other illnesses, such as tuberculosis, malaria, typhoid and intestinal worms, as well as from malnutrition. In countries with chronic malaria infestation, there is often a peak of fever post-operatively. The surgeon must therefore try to acquire some basic knowledge of the diseases specific to the area and their treatment. Local healthcare workers are usually familiar with these conditions and more expert in their treatment than expatriate staff. These Cultural constraints are another challenge that may add to the frustrations of medical work in a combat zone. In some societies, amputations and laparotomies can only be performed with the consent of the family of the patient. After a discussion in which the clear advantages are explained, the final decision must be left to the family. This procedure, which respects local cultural and social behaviour and norms, has to be followed and accepted even though it may be considered as a limitation and constraint by surgical and nursing staff.

WAR SURGERY 1.4.8 Constraints: the human factor “War surgery is a surgery of complications, performed by doctors who are often ill-trained or without surgical training. It is surgery replete with adaptations and  improvisations to replace that which is missing, a surgery of  surprises that new means and methods of combat reveal.\" 7 This classic quotation from the Swiss army's war surgery manual describes the situation for the new military surgeon and, as is more and more often the case in contemporary conflicts, for civilian surgeons faced with the victims of armed conflict for the first time. New ICRC surgeons coming from the National Red Cross or Red Crescent Society of a rich industrialized country face the same challenges: a constantly changing field of battle with new limits and constraints that come as a surprise. One must plan for alternatives and always keep an open mind to new options. If military war surgery is the management of an “epidemic of trauma” in a series of echelons, this is not always the prevailing situation in non-military circumstances. Unlike a military field hospital, an ICRC hospital is responsible for all levels of medical care. It often acts as a first-aid post, field hospital, base hospital, and referral centre all in one. The “multi-surgeon” military approach to treatment in echelons gives way to a more traditional one of attending to the entire surgical history of a patient. However, since deployment of ICRC surgeons is usually for a short period of time (three months on average), a number of surgeons may be involved in caring for a single patient. Continuity of care is essential. The modern military may \"project forward\" technical skills by deploying field surgical teams close to the battlefield. The aim is to perform critical surgery, often damage control surgery, as soon as possible after injury in an attempt to save lives, thereby reducing the number killed in action. The ICRC has also deployed field surgical teams – Somalia in 1992, southern Sudan in 2000, and Darfur in 2005 – but with a different aim: the protection of non-combatants and wounded fighters who no longer participate in hostilities and who would otherwise have no access to surgical care. The performance of this medical act and the protection of access to surgical care are based on the essential principles of the ICRC as a neutral and impartial humanitarian actor. The surgeon must be able to adapt to the conditions of field surgery where \"somewhat clean with soap and water\" replaces a \"sterile\" environment and \"favourite\" surgical  instruments are not available on the standard list. Furthermore, living conditions may resemble camping out in the bush and everyone in the team (4 members: surgeon, anaesthetist, theatre nurse and post-operative nurse) participates in the preparation of food and accommodation. The following qualities are particularly needed by personnel working in ICRC hospitals or field surgical teams: • professionalism; • sound judgement and common sense; • adaptability. Local skills and material improvisation in some countries may bring to the attention of the surgeon efficient, cheap, and useful ways of treatment: mashed papaya for burns or autoclaved banana leaves as a non-adherent dressing, for instance. Expatriate personnel must show themselves capable of learning \"new old tricks\" and adapting to the circumstances. War surgery is a challenge and the work trying. Medical staff must be prepared – physically and mentally – for frustrations, fatigue and long hours, and being a witness to the results of “man’s inhumanity to man”."}

{"text": "\n## 'You may not be interested in war. War is interested in you.\n\n One of the specificities of the war-wounded and those who care for them is their relationship to international humanitarian law, mainly the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols. In 19th century Europe, large-scale battles caused real carnage on the battlefields. Soldiers were regarded as cannon fodder and almost no medical services were available. Solferino, a town in northern Italy, was the site of one of these awful battles in 1859: in 16 hours 40,000 people were killed or wounded. Many wounded soldiers were left to die on the battlefield, although many of them could have been saved had relief been available. The medical services of the armies were too limited to respond to such a number of casualties – there were more veterinarians for the horses than doctors for the soldiers! Wounded soldiers lay agonizing for days without help. Henry Dunant, a Swiss businessman travelling in the area, was struck by this drama. Out of compassion, he spontaneously organized help with the women from the  neighbouring villages. Relief was given to all wounded soldiers without discrimination, regardless of their nationality. Others had performed humanitarian deeds on battlefields before; Dunant's genius lies in having taken things a lot further. Back in his hometown, Geneva, still traumatized, he wrote a book, A Memory of Solferino, published in 1862, in which he not only related the horrible battle and the suffering of the soldiers, but also launched an appeal around a vision and two key ideas. The vision was to provide neutral medical care for wounded soldiers in the field, and the ideas to accomplish this vision were the following. • On the one hand, to create a relief society in every country which, already in peacetime, would train volunteers who could assist the armed forces’ medical services, doctors and nurses ready to care for wounded soldiers in the event of war – this later gave birth to National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. • On the other hand, to negotiate an international agreement that would grant protection and assistance to the sick and wounded and the medical services which cared for them, thus guaranteeing access to the wounded. This idea became the first Geneva Convention, the basis for modern international humanitarian law (IHL). Every human society throughout history has had rules about the conduct of warfare: this was the first concerted attempt to standardize and institutionalize, on an international basis, the law of war. IHL is also referred to as the “law of war” or the “law of armed conflict”. Five citizens of Geneva, including Dunant, members of a charitable association, created the “International Committee for the Relief of Wounded Soldiers” in 1863 in response to Dunant’s book. This Geneva Committee persuaded the Swiss government to convene a diplomatic conference in 1864, in order to formalize the protection of medical services on the battlefield through an internationally recognized treaty: twelve governments participated. The result was the Geneva Convention of 22 August, 1864, for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field. The Geneva Committee became the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the emblem of the red cross was adopted as a symbol of protection of the medical services that cared for the sick and wounded – the symbols of the red crescent, the red sun and lion, and red crystal were introduced later. Not only was this first Geneva Convention a decisive step towards formalizing the laws of armed conflict, but it also made it the duty of signatory States to create military medical services to care for their own wounded. Soldiers were no longer to be simply regarded as cannon fodder. Figure 2.1 The battle of Solferino, 1859. WAR SURGERY l.

{"text": "\n## 2.2\n\n \n## International humanitarian law: basic principles\n\n Throughout history, humanity has known war. All human societies have developed customary rules that regulate how wars are fought. Over 500 cartels, codes of conduct, covenants and other texts designed to regulate hostilities had been recorded before the advent of contemporary humanitarian law. The first laws of war were proclaimed by major civilizations several millennia before our era: “I establish these laws to prevent the Just as there is no society of any sort that does not have its own set of rules, so there has never been a war that did not have some vague or precise rules covering the outbreak and end of hostilities, as well as how they were to be conducted. The Geneva Conventions (GCs) as they stand today are the result of a long process. Over the years, the First Geneva Convention has been extended to meet the changing needs of modern warfare. Three other Conventions were adopted, one after the other, covering victims other than wounded soldiers: shipwrecked sailors, prisoners of war, and civilian populations. The four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their two Additional Protocols of 1977, in particular, as well as other written treaties and customary law, constitute international humanitarian law (IHL): i.e. what is and what is not permitted during international and non-international conflicts. All States in the world have now ratified the Geneva Conventions, which means that they are bound by these legal instruments. The four Geneva Conventions are mainly designed to regulate the behaviour of combatants and to protect persons who are not (or are no longer) taking part in hostilities in armed conflicts between States (international conflicts). l.  Convention for the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and sick in armed forces in the field (GC I: Revision of the 1864 Convention). I. Convention for the amelioration of the condition of wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea (GC II: revision of the 1899 Convention). II.  Convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war (GC III: revision of the 1929 Convention). IV.   Convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war (GC IV: new Article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 also provides basic rules applicable in armed conflicts \"not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties”. In response to new needs in contemporary armed conflicts, the Conventions were developed and supplemented in 1977 by two further agreements: the Additional Protocols I and II relating to the protection, respectively, of victims of international and internal armed conflicts. A third Additional Protocol was adopted in 2005 to introduce a new protective emblem called the red crystal in addition to the red cross and red crescent emblems. IHL regulates humanitarian issues in times of war; it aims to define the rights and obligations of the parties to a conflict in the conduct of warfare and to protect persons who are not (or are no longer) taking part in hostilities (civilians, wounded or sick soldiers, prisoners of war). These persons must be respected, protected and treated humanely by all parties. All the wounded and sick must also receive the medical care required by their condition. Those who provide such care must be respected and protected, as long as they are involved in their humanitarian tasks. The various treaties defining IHL have become intricate, but the underlying message is simple. The human dignity of all individuals must be respected at all times without any kind of discrimination. Everything that can be done should be done to alleviate the suffering of those “ hors de combat ” : persons who take no direct part in the conflict or who have been put out of action by sickness, injury, or captivity.

Some human rights treaties permit governments to derogate from certain rights in situations of public emergency and if strict conditions are fulfilled. However, certain fundamental human rights must be respected in all circumstances and may never be waived, regardless of the emergency: in particular the right to life, the prohibition of torture and inhuman punishment or treatment, slavery and servitude, and the principle of legality and non-retroactivity of the law. No derogations are permitted under IHL because it was conceived for emergency situations, namely armed conflict. IHL mainly aims to protect people who do not or are no longer taking part in hostilities. The rules embodied in IHL impose duties on all parties to a conflict, including non-governmental groups. Human rights, being tailored primarily for peacetime, apply to everyone. Their principal goal is to protect individuals from arbitrary behaviour by their own governments.

{"text": "\n## 2.5 Rights and duties of medical personnel according to IHL\n\n IHL provides medical personnel with rights in times of armed conflict, but also assigns duties to them. The duties incumbent on them are directly linked to the rights of the protected persons placed in their care. These provisions are a case-specific refinement of the basic rights and duties defined by medical ethics and the Hippocratic oath. Medical personnel are bound by medical ethics and IHL to treat patients solely on the basis of need and without regard for their nationality, race and class, religious or political beliefs. These rights and duties have been defined to enable medical personnel to perform the humanitarian task entrusted to them, born of the desire to alleviate human suffering by helping and tending the wounded and the sick, which is the very purpose of the medical mission. The Geneva Conventions define medical personnel as: • persons assigned by a party to the conflict, whether on a permanent or temporary basis, exclusively to medical purposes (search, collection, transportation, diagnosis and treatment of the wounded and sick, and for the prevention of disease) – this includes doctors, nurses, orderlies, first aiders, and stretcher-bearers; • persons assigned by a party to the conflict, whether on a permanent or temporary basis, exclusively to the administration or operation of medical units or medical transport – this includes administrators, drivers, cooks, mechanics, etc. The term \"medical personnel\" is thus not confined to the narrow meaning of the word. All personnel required to ensure the adequate treatment of the wounded and sick are covered by the protection granted to them, as long as they form an integral part of the medical service. See Annex 2. B: The Fundamental Principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. WAR SURGERY Medical units, whether military or civilian, include what is set up for medical purposes: • all buildings or installations (hospitals, clinics, first-aid posts, field hospitals, tents, etc.), • blood transfusion and preventive medicine centres, • medical and pharmaceutical depots and stores. They may be fixed or mobile, permanent or temporary. Medical equipment includes: • stretchers, • medical and surgical appliances and instruments, Medical transport can be organized by land, water, and air: • ambulances, lorries or trucks, • hospital ships, rescue craft, • medical aircraft, etc. Medical personnel must not be the object of attack, and must be allowed to care for the sick and wounded unhindered. They should wear the distinctive emblem of the red cross, red crescent or red crystal on a white ground and carry an identity card. Military medics may bear arms only for their own defence and to defend the wounded and sick from pillage. However, they must not use arms to prevent capture of their patients, units or themselves by the enemy; by doing so they lose their protected status. If medical personnel fall under the control of enemy troops, they shall be allowed to continue their duties towards the wounded and sick. They shall not be compelled to perform acts contrary to medical ethics, or refrain from performing acts required by medical ethics. A patient remains a patient, and medical personnel have a responsibility to provide care according to their training and the means available. If captured medical personnel are not indispensable to the care of other prisoners, they should be repatriated. Those retained shall not be considered prisoners of war and their work shall be facilitated. In occupied territory, civilian medical personnel should be allowed to continue providing adequate medical services for the civilian population. The civilian population shall respect the wounded and sick, even if they belong to the enemy, and shall commit no act of violence against them. Civilians are permitted to collect and care for the wounded and sick of whatever nationality, and shall not be Medical units enjoy protected status so long as they are not used to commit acts harmful to the enemy, such as sheltering able-bodied combatants, storing arms or ammunition, or being used as military observation posts. Otherwise, their protection ceases and they become legitimate military targets. This is why strict controls must be established to safeguard the protected status of medical units and transport. To enhance the protection of medical units and medical transport, they should be clearly marked with the red cross, red crescent or red crystal emblem, of the largest size possible. The emblem is the visible sign of protection conferred by the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols. APPLICABLE INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW"}
{"text": "\n## 2.6\n\n \n## Responsibility of States\n\n As with any international agreement, the governments of States have a distinct responsibility whenever they become party to a treaty. • The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols are both contracts with other States and commitments towards humankind by which governments have agreed to certain rules that regulate the conduct of armed hostilities and the protection of persons who are not (or are no longer) taking part in hostilities, what is known as “law in war”, or jus in bello. Its provisions apply to the warring parties regardless of the reasons for the conflict and whether or not the cause upheld by either party is considered to be just, or not. • On becoming party to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, States agree to respect and ensure respect for their obligations in all circumstances (common Art. 1). • Reciprocity is not considered to be a prerequisite to a country adhering to and applying these rules, but it exists in reality and practice. It is in everyone’s interest that everyone apply the law of his or her own accord. • States are responsible for protecting those who do not participate or are no longer participating in hostilities. • During peacetime, States are to promote IHL and train the members of their armed forces to respect IHL. • At all times, States must take all measures necessary for the prevention and • On becoming party to the Geneva Conventions, States undertake to enact any legislation necessary to punish persons guilty of grave breaches of them, and are also bound to prosecute in their own courts any person suspected of having done so, or to hand over that person to another State for judgment. In other words, perpetrators of grave breaches, i.e. war criminals, must be prosecuted at all times and in all places, and States are responsible for ensuring that this is done. • A number of independent mechanisms have been set up, each within its mandate and competency, to promote better compliance with IHL, including the ICRC, the International Fact-finding Commission, regional and United Nations bodies, and the International Criminal Court (Rome Statute of 1998). Their adequacy and sufficiency in meeting the task remains a challenge to humanity. • Generally speaking, a State's criminal laws apply only to crimes committed on its territory or by its own nationals. International humanitarian law goes further in Figure 2.10 All too often the red cross emblem is used to indicate any health service without regard to its privileged legal status, which confers protection. WAR SURGERY that it requires States to seek out and punish any person who has committed a grave breach, irrespective of his nationality or the place where the offence was committed. This principle of universal jurisdiction is essential to guarantee that grave breaches are effectively repressed. Such prosecutions may be brought either by the national courts of the various States or by an international authority. In this connection, the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda were set up by the United Nations Security Council in 1993 and 1994, respectively, to try those accused of war crimes committed during the conflicts in those countries. • Lastly, the international community has created a permanent International Criminal Court (Rome Statute of 1998), which is competent to try war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. • The United Nations Security Council is the main body responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security. To this end, it may decide on measures, including coercive ones, against any State threatening or breaching international peace (Chapters VI and VII of the United Nations Charter). The rules that outlaw war, with some exceptions, are know as \"the law on the use of force\" or the jus ad bellum . This is different from the jus in bello , or IHL, which is the law applicable in times of armed conflict. • \"New\" or \"anarchic\" conflicts lead to the partial, and sometimes total, weakening or breakdown of State structures. In such situations, armed groups take advantage of the political vacuum in an attempt to grab power. It is not because a State’s structures have been weakened or are non-existent that there is a legal vacuum with regard to international law. The law, and its obligations, remain. Admittedly, humanitarian rules are harder to apply in these types of conflict. The lack of discipline among belligerents, the arming of the civilian population as weapons flood the territory, and the increasingly blurred distinction between fighters and civilians often cause confrontations to take an extremely brutal turn – in which there is little room for respect for IHL. As a result, this is the type of situation in which particular efforts are needed to make people aware of humanitarian law. Better knowledge of the rules of law will not solve the underlying problem which led to the conflict, but it is likely to attenuate its Insofar as a \"right – or even a duty – to intervene\" is tantamount to justifying armed intervention undertaken for humanitarian reasons, this is a matter not for humanitarian law but for the rules on the legality of the use of armed force in international relations, i.e. of jus ad bellum, according to the Charter of the United Nations.

{"text": "\n## 2.7\n\n \n## Reality check: some people do not follow the rules\n\n Given what the law dictates, what is the reality on the battlefield? Whether in conflict situations or in peacetime, and whether national or international law is applicable, laws are violated and crimes committed. There are many examples of violations of IHL: surrounding a military objective with medical units so that it will not be targeted; hiding weapons in a hospital; transporting able-bodied combatants in an ambulance; using an aircraft displaying the emblem for reconnaissance missions; not respecting the non-combatant status of sick and wounded soldiers – on the contrary, all too often their survival is seen as an invitation by some to \"finish the job\", and atrocities are the result. All too often hospitals and medical personnel are the target of attack, or are prevented from doing their duty of caring for the sick and wounded, which is perceived by some as giving “succour and aid to the enemy”. All these violations have three things in common: they seriously weaken the system of protection embodied in IHL, they divert people and objects displaying the red cross, red crescent or red crystal from their humanitarian purpose, and they put lives in danger by fostering mistrust. Figure 2.12 Unfortunately, hospitals are not immune to attack: this photo shows a blatant contravention of IHL. Red Cross and Red Crescent personnel are not immune to this lack of respect for IHL. Mussolini's air force bombed a Swedish Red Cross field hospital during the invasion of Abyssinia on 30 December 1935, and 28 people were killed and 50 wounded. More recently, masked gunmen entered the residence of the ICRC hospital in the village of Novye Atagi, Chechnya (southern Russia), in December 1996 and assassinated five nurses and the construction engineer in cold blood. The authors of this text have all too often been threatened, prevented from reaching and treating the victims, or seen their hospital attacked or bombed. The world over, colleagues, both civilian and military, are time and again made to suffer \"simply\" because they want to fulfil their Humanitarian action is based on a fundamentally \"optimistic philosophy\", wrote Jean Pictet.²  But this optimism in no way detracts from the \"philosophy's\" realism. It is aware that humanitarian work is difficult. Its greatest enemies may well be neither weapons nor disaster, but selfishness, indifference and discouragement. One should not despair, however. Rather one should see this as an incentive to redouble efforts to educate those involved in armed conflict. Medical ethics go hand in hand with IHL and the Fundamental Principle of impartiality: the sick and wounded are entitled to treatment, whatever their origin or political persuasion. Jean Pictet (1914 – 2002) was Director-General and Honorary Vice-President of the ICRC. He was responsible for the preparatory works that led to the 1949 revision of the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols of 1977, and his writings formed the basis of the Fundamental Charter of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, adopted in 1965.

{"text": "\n## All medical personnel should not only comply with   medical ethics and IHL but should also disseminate their meaning to military and civilian authorities, ordinary  soldiers and citizens.\n\n Medical practitioners have a particularly important part to play: they have responsibilities with regard to individual patients but also towards society at large. They must convince combatants of the need to respect IHL, to refrain from attacking the medical facilities and personnel of the enemy and allow them to perform their humanitarian task. While the underlying philosophy of the Movement is not rooted in the principle of reciprocity, in practice medical professionals can only expect to benefit from the “protection” offered by the Geneva Conventions – in a general atmosphere of respect for the Fundamental Principles – if their colleagues practising on the \"other\" side also benefit from the same protection. They must inform those who bear weapons of their obligations and trust that colleagues in contact with the opposing side are doing the same. This has proved true in the past, and soldiers have often respected the principle of protection afforded to the sick and wounded and medical and religious personnel."}
{"text": "\n## The neutrality of a National Red Cross/ 2.8 Red Crescent Society\n\n Another major problem faced during armed conflicts of a non-international character, that is to say internal conflicts, is the question of neutrality, especially of a National Red Cross or Red Crescent Society. The requirement of non-discrimination is of particular concern to Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies, it is in fact a condition for their recognition. They must be open to all those who wish to become members and must permit all social, political and religious groups to be represented; this representativity is the guarantee of the Societies' ability to engage in exclusively humanitarian activities and to resist all partisan considerations. It is admittedly not always an easy task to apply the principle of neutrality, not least because everyone has personal convictions. When tension mounts and passions are aroused, every member of the Red Cross or Red Crescent must exercise great self- control and refrain from expressing his/her opinions in the discharge of his duties. Volunteers are not asked to be neutral – everyone is entitled to an opinion – but to act neutrally. That is an important distinction. The next difficulty is the fact that the parties to the conflict often take a dim view of neutral behaviour. In countries where an internal conflict is taking place, the armed forces fail to understand why the National Society does not condemn the activities of those they regard as “bandits”, much less why it wants to provide assistance to any of their number no longer able to fight. As for the opposition, they are critical of the Society's connections with the authorities. Anyone trying to work on both sides to help non-combatants is considered at best naïve, at worst a traitor. The extremely polarized nature of many struggles is such that not taking a stand is a hostile act in itself. This is why the Red Cross and Red Crescent’s neutrality and impartiality must be explained. As one National Society first aider put it: “The best argument I have is to tell one of the parties to the conflict that if I take its side and ignore the victims on the other side, I will never again be able to bring help to its own wounded members”. It would appear, indeed, that the principles of neutrality and impartiality are ideals to be attained, inner qualities that are rarely inborn but that most often require one to overcome one’s instincts. They demand from members of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies arduous and sustained efforts to overcome their own prejudices and preferences in order to be able to perform the purest act of impartiality, which is to give more help to the adversary who is the victim of great misfortune than to the friend whose suffering is less severe, or to care for the more severely wounded, even if guilty, before assisting the innocent whose injuries are slighter.

{"text": "\n## The role and mandate of the ICRC in situations 2.9\n\n Established in 1863, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is an impartial, neutral, and independent organization whose exclusively humanitarian mission is to protect the lives and dignity of the victims of war and internal violence and to provide them with assistance. The ICRC endeavours to prevent suffering by promoting and strengthening international humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles. The ICRC in a nutshell Neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian organization.  Works in situations of armed conflict. Entrusted with an international mandate under the Geneva Conventions. Protects and assists victims of conflict. Part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The ICRC has been named the \"guardian and promoter\" of IHL by the States party to the Geneva Conventions. It works during armed conflict to protect and assist the victims: the wounded and sick, prisoners of war and other detainees, and the civilian population. The ICRC does not take sides or determine right or wrong in a conflict. The neutrality of the ICRC, however, is not a widely appreciated principle. There are many who express indignation at its neutrality in the mistaken belief that neutrality betokens lack of commitment and courage. The ICRC, for its part, has great difficulty in getting the parties to a conflict to understand that the only thing it must grant equally to each is its willingness to serve, and that in other respects its activities are proportional to the needs,  and consequently unequal when distress is greater on one side than on the other. At the beginning of hostilities, the ICRC: • reminds the belligerents of their obligations according to IHL; • offers its services as a neutral intermediary for the accomplishment of humanitarian activities; • makes an assessment of the needs; • acts in favour of victims according to the needs. The protection role the ICRC plays consists in acting in defence of people who are not, or no longer, taking part in combat: the wounded or sick, detainees or prisoners of war, and civilians, including the inhabitants of territories administered or occupied by a hostile power. The ICRC approaches the competent authorities to ensure that these victims receive humane treatment. The ICRC has the right to have access to prisoners of war (Third Geneva Convention), and detained persons covered by the Fourth Geneva Convention, including the right to visit detention camps. The ICRC has an official policy of discretion. Only when it observes grave and repeated breaches of IHL and when its confidential representations have been in vain and it considers that the only means of helping the victims is to ask for the support of the international community, does it make public representations. This sometimes takes the form of an appeal to the States party to the Geneva Conventions, whose responsibility it is to respect and ensure respect for IHL. Such initiatives are nevertheless the exception rather than the rule. WAR SURGERY"}

As a neutral and independent institution, the ICRC is authorized by the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols to administer first aid and other care in the field to victims of armed conflict. Military authorities are required to permit the ICRC to collect and care for the wounded or sick of whatever nationality, even in invaded or occupied territories.

Misuse of the emblem is a serious problem. In peacetime, hospitals, clinics, doctors' offices, pharmacies, non-governmental organizations and commercial companies tend to use the emblem in order to benefit from its reputation, although they are not entitled to do so.

The establishment of such Societies was consistent with the aims of the original Geneva Convention of 1864. APPLICABLE INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW The National Societies' activities have developed steadily and diversified over the years. The Societies' concern, at first directed only at members of the armed forces, now extends to protection and assistance of all those, whether military or civilian, who are the victims of conflicts, in close cooperation with the ICRC, and of natural catastrophes, in close cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. National Societies have also developed many activities in peacetime as auxiliaries to the public authorities to alleviate suffering, improve health, National Society membership is open to everyone and services are provided on the sole criterion of need. National Societies must fulfil stringent conditions to achieve recognition by the ICRC and obtain International Federation membership. Among these conditions: respect for the Fundamental Principles, and recognition by their home government as a voluntary aid society, auxiliary to the public authorities. Each National Red Cross/Red Crescent Society has its own particular characteristics, and its activities cover a wide range depending on the needs of the country and on the Society’s operational capabilities. The one activity that all National Societies share is the provision and teaching of first aid."}

{"text": "\n##  Blunt injury in war\n\n Blunt trauma is common in war. Severe injury due to blunt trauma may be more difficult to detect than in cases of penetrating trauma, and X-ray diagnosis and other more sophisticated technologies are more valuable for patient assessment. Military vehicles often drive at high speed over difficult terrain where safe roads do not exist. In addition, the environment of any accident may be hostile (presence of enemy forces, minefields, etc.). The collapse of bombed buildings will cause blunt and crush injuries to anyone inside. Explosions and anti-tank mines A bomb or shell explosion can throw people against objects. A car, bus or lorry carrying passengers may drive over an anti-tank mine. The explosion of the mine overturns or destroys the vehicle and people are thrown out and onto the ground, thus suffering blunt injuries."}

{"text": "\n## 3.1.2 Penetrating wounds caused by weapons of war\n\n A moving projectile has kinetic energy. When the projectile enters the human body, it releases energy to the tissues thus causing a wound. There are two types of wounding projectiles: bullets and metallic fragments (or splinters, shards, and shrapnel)²."}
{"text": "\n## Fragment wounds\n\n Exploding bombs, shells, rockets and grenades, submunitions (cluster bomblets) and some landmines, produce metal fragments from the weapon casing (primary projectiles). In the past these fragments were usually irregular in size and shape. In many modern weapons, however, the inner lining of the casing is scored, creating weak points that break off easily on explosion. This generates a controlled fragmentation of large numbers of pre-formed fragments that are regular in size and shape, and usually less than 1 g in weight. In other, usually improvised bombs and explosive devices, nails, bolts, steel pellets or other metallic debris surround the explosive material. Different types of shells and explosives. The word \"shrapnel\" is derived from the name of Major-General Henry Shrapnel (1761–1842), an English officer, who designed a new type of artillery shell. The term originally referred only to the metal balls dispersed when a shrapnel shell bursts, but is often used to describe metal fragments intentionally included in explosive devices. For shells, bombs or other munitions, the technical term for these particles is fragments, splinters or shards, fragments being the preferred name in scientific documents and the term that is used in this manual WAR SURGERY Fragments are shot off at a very high speed, which decreases rapidly with the distance travelled because of their non-aerodynamic character. The farther the victim is from the explosion, the more superficial the wounds. At very close range, multiple high- energy fragments combined with the blast effect create mutilating injuries and are often fatal. Explosions may cause stones or bricks to break up, shatter glass panes, or the force of the blast wind may transport other debris, also producing penetrating fragments (secondary projectiles), as described in Section 3.1.4. Fragment wounds are usually multiple and the wound tract is always widest at the entry. There may or may not be an exit wound."}
{"text": "\n## Bullet wounds\n\n Handguns and military assault rifles shoot bullets at high speed. Bullet wounds seen in the injured are usually single with a small entry; multiple bullet injuries are more likely to kill. There may be no exit wound but, if there is, the size is variable. The amount of tissue damage depends on a number of factors. According to international humanitarian law – both customary and conventional – the use of bullets that expand or flatten easily in the human body is prohibited during armed conflict. The bullets used should not cause superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering. This fundamental rule is based on the general principles of international humanitarian law, according to which “… it is sufficient to disable the greatest possible number of men\" and “That this object would be exceeded by the employment of arms which uselessly aggravate the suffering of disabled men or render their death inevitable\". 3 Because of various ballistic effects, however, some bullets do break up into fragments in the body.

Unexploded ordnance is often left on the battlefield and has similar injuring effects as fragmentation mines (the lethal remnants of war consisting of cluster bomblets, bombs and shells that did not explode when fired).

The severity of the wound depends on the amount of explosive in the mine compared to the body mass (Figure 3.4)."}
{"text": "\n## Pattern 2\n\n A person touches the tripwire attached to a fragmentation mine, which provokes its detonation.

{"text": "\n##  Explosive blast injuries  3.1.4\n\n The detonation of high-energy explosives creates a travelling pressure blast wave in the air, (or in water for underwater explosions). The wave causes rapid and large changes in the outside atmospheric pressure: the positive pressure shock wave is followed by a negative pressure phase (Figure 3.5). Immediately behind the pressure wave is a mass movement of air: the blast wind. As the blast wave passes any unprotected person it affects all parts of the body, especially those normally containing air. A victim of blast may not have any external injury. A single, large explosion may injure many people at the same time. Explosions  in a closed space (building, bus, etc.) are more fatal than those out in the open."}
{"text": "\n## Categorization of blast injuries\n\n  Blast injuries are commonly categorized into four types."}
{"text": "\n## Primary\n\n These are direct pressure effects. Rupture of the tympanic membrane is the most common injury. Rupture of the lung alveoli and their capillaries (“blast lung”) is the most lethal injury amongst survivors."}
{"text": "\n## Secondary\n\n These injuries include missile wounds. Fragments may arise from the bomb casing or contents (primary missiles). Home-made bombs (improvised explosive devices, known as IED) may be packed with nuts and bolts, screws and ball bearings. In addition, the blast wind may mobilize various objects (secondary missiles) that then cause penetrating wounds."}
{"text": "\n## Tertiary\n\n These effects are directly due to the blast wind. It can cause total body disintegration in the immediate vicinity of the explosion; traumatic amputations and evisceration further away. The wind can make buildings collapse or throw people against objects. Trauma may be blunt, crush or penetrating."}
{"text": "\n## Quaternary\n\n Miscellaneous types of harm due to burns, asphyxia from carbon monoxide or toxic gases, or the inhalation of dust, smoke or contaminants. The various injuries caused by major blasts cover a whole spectrum of trauma and many patients suffer several injuries from a variety of effects: i.e. multiple injuries from one single weapon system."}
{"text": "\n## Other situations of blast injuries\n\n The blast wave travels more rapidly and much further in water than in air. Blast injuries in water occur at greater distances and can be more severe. Moreover, underwater explosions tend to cause pure primary blast injury. A \"fuel air explosive\"  – the liquid explosive material is dispersed in the air like an aerosol and then ignited – also tends to bring about pure primary blast injury and quaternary effects due to the consumption of all oxygen in the nearby air. The blast effect of a marine mine exploding below an icy surface, or the \"deck slap\" of a ship hit by a torpedo, produces a shock wave that can severely fracture the bones of anyone on deck or inside the ship. Similarly, some anti-tank mines send a blast wave through the floor of the vehicle causing closed fractures of the foot and leg. The foot appears like a “bag of bones” inside intact skin, which was described in World War I as \"pied de mine\": a mine foot. Anti-personnel blast mines have a local blast effect,  vaporizing the tissues of the contact foot, as described previously.  For further information on blast injuries, see Volume 2.

{"text": "\n## 3.1.5\n\n \n## Burns\n\n A large explosion may cause flash burns or the carbonization of tissues. Bombing may start secondary fires in buildings and an anti-tank mine may ignite the petrol tank of a vehicle. Burns are common amongst the crews of tanks, ships and aircraft hit by missiles. Some types of anti-personnel blast mines provoke burning as well as traumatic amputation of the limb. Certain weapons cause specific burns: napalm and phosphorus bombs, magnesium flares and decoys."}
{"text": "\n## 3.1.6\n\n \n## Non-conventional weapons\n\n International humanitarian law prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons. Nonetheless, this absolute prohibition cannot entirely exclude that a State or a non- State armed group resort to using them. A bomb surrounded by radioactive material – the so-called “dirty bomb” – is not a nclear bomb. The explosion is caused by conventional means but, depending on the force of the explosion, radioactive material may be spread over a wide area. The bombing of nuclear medicine and other laboratory facilities, or nuclear power plants, may also release radioactive material into the atmosphere. The reader should refer to standard military texts and those of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) for chemical agents, and relevant documents of the World Health Organization (WHO) for biological agents.

{"text": "\n## 3.2.1\n\n \n## Introduction\n\n Blast and penetrating missile wounds occur in times of armed conflict and whenever the weapons of war are used in peacetime. Weapons cause specific but variable patterns of injury. While standard surgical techniques will suffice to treat simple wounds, the management of war wounds produced by high-energy weapons is based on an understanding of the mechanisms by which projectiles cause injury: wound ballistics. Only by understanding certain physical phenomena can the surgeon appreciate the different varieties of wounds seen in armed conflict and the difference between these wounds and the trauma that is seen in everyday civilian practice. Although the study of ballistics may be \"interesting\" in its own right, the clinician does not always know what weapon inflicted the injury; and never knows the energy available at point of impact. One can only estimate the transfer of energy in the tissues from the extent of tissue damage. The study of ballistics gives us an understanding of the basic mechanisms at work during wounding. The importance of this knowledge lies in the fact that projectile injuries should be neither under- nor over-treated. The clinical assessment of the actual wound is the most important factor determining management, and an understanding of ballistics allows the surgeon to better understand the pathology and assess the injuries that he sees, rather than explain every wound and determine 5 Lindsey D.

{"text": "\n## Basic definitions\n\n Ballistics is the part of the science of mechanics that studies the motion and behaviour of a projectile, and its effects on a target."}
{"text": "\n## Internal ballistics\n\n Internal ballistics deals with the processes that occur inside a gun barrel when a shot is fired: gas pressures on combustion of the propellant powder, the energy and heat released, and the course of the projectile in the barrel, are just some of its concerns."}
{"text": "\n## External ballistics\n\n External ballistics describes the projectile trajectory once it has left the barrel. The influences affecting the flight include gravity, air resistance and crosswind deflection, stability of the projectile (spin and yaw), as well as any contact prior to the projectile reaching the target, known as ricochet."}
{"text": "\n## Terminal ballistics\n\n Terminal ballistics describes what happens when the projectile hits the target, as well as any counter-effects produced by the target on the projectile. If the target is biological tissues, terminal ballistics is called wound ballistics and describes the effects on the tissues."}
{"text": "\n## Internal ballistics 3.2.2\n\n \n## Bullets: fundamental concepts\n\n Figure 3.6 shows the main components of a bullet cartridge. The primer is struck by a mechanism in the gun to produce a small detonation and flame that sets off the powder in the case. This causes a very rapid burn with the production of a large volume of rapidly expanding gas, which pushes the bullet out of the barrel of the gun. The velocity with which the bullet leaves the barrel is called the muzzle velocity."}
{"text": "\n## Bullet construction\n\n Bullets are classified according to a number of parameters; one is their manufacture: internal structure and composition (Figure 3.7). They vary according to their calibre and mass. Millitary bullets Hunting bullets b d c Figure 3.7 Bullets according to construction. a. 303 British Mark II produced in Dum Dum, India, 1896 (see footnote number 7). b. Full metal jacket (FMJ): military-issue bullets have a soft core (lead) with a full metal jacket of copper. c. Hard core bullet: the lead has been replaced by steel or tungsten for better penetrating power. d. Tracer bullet: contains a pyrotechnical substance at the tail-end that burns up in identify and pinpoint the target. e. Semi-jacketed bullet (SJ): part of the point is not jacketed, thus exposing the lead inside. This is supposed to be used only for hunting; its use by combatants during armed conflict is illegal. f. Semi-jacketed hollow-point (SJ-HP): also a hunting bullet with a hollow nose tip; also illegal during armed conflict. MECHANISMS OF INJURY Apart from the hunting bullets mentioned in Figure 3.7, special rifles and their ammunition exist for hunting: shotguns whose shells give off multiple lead or steel shots (pellets) available in diameters from 2 to 9 mm (Figure 3.8). Hunting bullets are not supposed to be used by combatants in armed conflict. These bullets are constructed in such a way as to kill rather than wound. The idea is to be more \"humane\" when hunting wild animals and to have a \"rapid and clean kill\". Nonetheless, the surgeon will be faced with wounds caused by such weapons either because of accidents, criminal activity, or because combatants have illegally used them during cmbat. The international legal limits placed on bullets used by the military do not apply to domestic use during peacetime, and the civilian surgeon may at times face more devastating gunshot wounds than the military surgeon on the battlefield."}
{"text": "\n## Muzzle velocities\n\n Firearms are classically divided into two categories: high-velocity (rifles) and low- velocity (handguns).The latter fire relatively heavy bullets at low muzzle velocities of 150 – 200 m/s. A typical military assault rifle fires a smaller bullet at 700 – 950 m/s. This, however, says nothing about the actual velocity when the bullet reaches the target. 9 mm Luger pistol 350 m/s .38 Special handgun 20 m/s .44 Magnum handgun 40 m/s 7.62 x 51 mm NATO rifle 830 m/s 5.56 x 45 mm M16 rifle 960 m/s 7.62 x 39 mm AK-47 Kalashnikov rifle 720 m/s 5.45 x 39 mm AK-74 Kalashnikov rifle 900 m/s 12 gauge shotgun 420 m/s Table 3.1 Some examples of muzzle velocity from different firearms."}
{"text": "\n## The gun barrel\n\n A bullet is a long cylindrical projectile that only flies with stability if a high spin around its longitudinal axis is attained, thus giving it a gyroscopic effect. To achieve this spin, gun barrels are constructed with interior spiral grooves (twists). This is a “rifled” barrel, used in all handguns and high-velocity rifles (Figure 3.9). The barrels of shotguns are smooth on the inside; they are not “rifled”. This limits their accuracy and distance of fire (Figure 3.10)."}
{"text": "\n## Design of firing\n\n Another classification of firearms is according to their design of firing. A weapon operated with a single hand is a \"handgun\". If the barrel and cartridge chamber are in one piece, this is a \"pistol\". If several chambers rotate behind the barrel, it is called a \"revolver\". If both hands are required to operate the weapon, it is referred to as a \"rifle\" or \"shotgun\". Firing capacity defines how individual shots are fired. For a single-shot weapon, every shot is loaded individually. A repeating weapon includes a magazine that holds a series of cartridges which load manually one after the other. If the loading movement is repeated automatically after every shot, but every shot is fired individually, this is a semi-automatic weapon. If the automatic loading of cartridges allows several shots to be fired with one pull of the trigger, it is known as an automatic weapon. In modern military usage, most weapons are automatic rifles and sub-machine guns or semi-automatic pistols. Load of shot Shell casing Felt wad Powder Primer Shotgun shell and load of shot.

{"text": "\n## External ballistics 3.2.3\n\n \n## Flight in air\n\n Once shot off, several variables affecting the projectile in flight tend to influence its stability, accuracy of targeting, or velocity. The most important variables include the following. • Spin around its own longitudinal axis, giving it gyroscopic stability. • Distance travelled and the effect of gravity, including the shooting angle – is the bullet shot upwards or is the trajectory flat? • Air drag: friction is responsible for 10% of total area drag, while 90% is due to pressure effects; faster bullets are retarded proportionately more – rifle bullets are aerodynamically shaped to decrease air drag; this is not the case with shotgun cartridges or metal fragments. • Crosswind deflection. • Raindrops hitting the bullet. • Bullet hitting an obstacle before hitting the target. A rifle bullet in flight does not travel in a simple straightforward motion. Because it is a spinning gyroscope, the bullet “wobbles” and undergoes some very complicated movements (nutation, precession), the most important being yaw: the nose of the bullet moves up and down, away from the line of flight, and describes an angle with the target surface at impact (Figure 3.11). This influences the wounding potential of the bullet, as an important degree of yaw will destabilize the motion of the bullet inside the target."}
{"text": "\n## Ricochet\n\n A bullet may hit an obstacle during its flight. This may be a branch of a tree, a belt buckle, a concrete wall or the ground, or a soldier's helmet or flak jacket. This causes a ricochet; the bullet is given a small \"push\" that destabilizes it (Figure 3.12). There is an increase in the deviation of the nose of the bullet (yaw); the bullet may even tumble, rotating around itself. Such a large yaw angle at point of impact, as mentioned above, will have important consequences for the wounding potential of the bullet in the target. In addition, if the “push” is great enough, the bullet can be deformed or even broken up into fragments before hitting the target."}
{"text": "\n## 3.2.4 Summary\n\n There are, therefore, quite a number of variables involved in determining the characteristics of a projectile before it hits the target and these will influence its behaviour in the target and the efficiency in creating wounds. They include: • velocity at moment of impact and any residual velocity if there is an exit; • mass, shape, internal structure and composition of the projectile; • type of weapon, handgun or rifle; • stability of the projectile in flight; • any yaw at moment of impact.

{"text": "\n## Role of kinetic energy\n\n Any moving object has kinetic energy, whether it is a hand-wielded knife or club, a bullet fired from a gun, or a fragment given off by the explosion of a shell. This energy is described by the well-known formula:"}
{"text": "\n## E x = 1 ⁄ 2 m v 2\n\n This defines the total kinetic energy that the object possesses, but does not define the kinetic energy expended when the projectile passes into and through a target. For a bullet or fragment that does not change its mass, this is calculated from the difference in velocity between entry and exit. m (v, 2 – v, 2 ) If there is no exit, then ν , = 0, and all the kinetic energy has been transferred. If the bullet breaks up into fragments, then the mass (m) also changes, and E × EXP is modified. Total kinetic energy is the potential for causing damage; transferred kinetic energy is the capacity to cause damage. Actual tissue damage, however, depends on the efficiency of this energy transfer, which is determined by many other variables, as will be shown. Weapons according to E, Yet another classification of weapons is based on the amount of kinetic energy available for transfer. • Low energy: knife or hand-energized missiles. • Medium energy: handguns. • High energy: military or hunting rifles, with a muzzle velocity above 600 m/s or a large mass of projectile. For metal fragments given off by an explosion the initial velocity is very high; this decreases rapidly with distance. The wounding potential depends on the mass of the Many researchers have performed different experiments to describe the effect of projectiles on tissues. Targets have included human cadavers, various animals (pigs, dogs, goats) and tissue simulants. Tissue simulants are specially-prepared blocks of gelatine or glycerine soap, which have a density and/or viscosity close to that of muscle tissue. Soap is plastic and any deformation remains unchanged, representing the maximum effects. Gelatine is elastic and deformations disappear almost entirely; they are studied with high-speed cameras. If the stress on gelatine exceeds the limit of its elasticity then it will crack and tear, showing fracture lines. Compared to human cadavers and animals, tissue simulants have the advantage of allowing repetitions of the experiment, changing only one variable at a time. These laboratory experiments are all approximations, however, of what happens in a live hman being. Surgeons working for the ICRC have collaborated over many years with the ballistics laboratory of the Swiss Federal Department of Defence. 6 This laboratory uses gelatine and glycerine soap for its ballistics experiments. Its results have been confirmed by comparison with clinical cases treated by ICRC surgeons in various war zones throughout the world. 6 See footnote 1. WAR SURGERY Following these laboratory studies, five categories describe the behaviour of projectiles: non-deforming and deforming bullets, be they from rifles or handguns, and fragments."}
{"text": "\n## Non-deforming rifle bullet: 3.3.3 full metal jacket (FMJ) military bullet\n\n When a standard military bullet hits a soft object while in stable flight, it produces a “shooting channel” that presents three distinctive phases: narrow channel; primary temporary cavity; and terminal narrow channel (Figure 3.13). Phase 1 Straight narrow channel with a diameter about 1.5 times the calibre of the bullet. The greater the velocity, the wider the channel. Different types of bullets have a different length of narrow channel, typically 15 – 25 cm. Phase 2 The channel opens into the \"primary temporary cavity\". The reported diameter of this cavity is anywhere between 10 and 15 times the calibre of the bullet.  Figure 3.14 shows the motion of the bullet in a simulant. It starts to yaw, and tumbles, turning a full 270°, and then advances with its tail end forward. The whole lateral surface of the bullet comes into contact with the medium, which greatly decelerates the bullet and subjects it to an important stress. The slowing of the bullet involves a release of kinetic energy, which, in turn, causes the rapid and massive displacement of gelatine radially outwards, producing a cavity behind the projectile; there is a slight delay in the production of the cavity because  of the inertia of the gelatine mass. There is an almost complete vacuum in this cavity that quickly sucks in air from the entry hole, and from the exit hole if there is one. The cavity collapses after a few milliseconds, only to reform again, with a smaller volume. The cavitation continues until all the transferred energy is used up: the cavity pulsates! In water or gelatine, there are up to 7 – 8 pulsations, in biological tissues usually 3 – 4. The diameter of this cavity depends upon the elastic properties of the medium, as well as the amount of kinetic energy transferred. Fissures radiating from the shooting channel indicate that the shearing effect of the cavity has exceeded the elasticity of the gelatine. Figure 3.13 Non-deforming rifle bullet (FMJ) in soap."}

{"text": "\n## Phase 3\n\n The tumbling slows down and the bullet continues in a sideways position at a considerably reduced speed. In some cases, a narrow straight channel is observed; in others, the tumbling seems to continue but backwards, the bullet again assuming a lateral position, and a second cavity occurs. This does not reach the size of the primary temporary cavity. The bullet then creeps forward and finally stops, always with the tail end facing forwards. In an elastic medium such as glycerine, what remains in the shooting channel at the end of the process, and all temporary effects, is called the \"permanent channel\". References to these basic definitions of phases of the shooting channel will be made throughout this chapter."}
{"text": "\n## Please note:\n\n These three phases are found with all FMJ rifle bullets, yet each bullet has a specific shooting channel. The narrow channel of the 7.62 mm AK-47 is long (15 – 20 cm), while the 5.45 mm AK-74 produces a narrow channel of less than 5 cm before cavitation begins."}
{"text": "\n## Tumbling – yaw – in the target medium\n\n Given a long enough shooting channel, all FMJ rifle bullets tumble. How early the tumbling motion begins determines the length of the narrow channel, and the onset  of cavitation. This depends on the stability of the bullet – yaw – at the point of impact. The less stable the bullet in flight, the greater the yaw, which rapidly brings a larger bullet surface into contact with the medium, leading to early tumbling and a short narrow channel. How early FMJ bullets tumble is also a function of their manufacture  (mass, centre of gravity, etc.) and shooting distance."}
{"text": "\n## Fragmentation of FMJ bullets\n\n It is during phase 2 – the temporary cavity – that certain bullets deform or even break apart because of the enormous stress exerted on them. This occurs when the bullet- medium interface is at its maximum, the cavity is widest, and the transfer of kinetic energy is highest (Figures 3.15 and 3.16). If the projectile acts on the target medium, this is a good example of the medium acting on the projectile. This fragmentation occurs only at short shooting distances, up to 30 – 100 m, depending on the bullet’s Flake of ejected lead م Main body of bullet / Rear part of bullet  / The bullet flattens on its sides, bends in the middle and, finally, the jacket splits and the lead inside spills out (Figure 3.17). This gives the “shower of lead” picture often seen on X-rays (Figures 3.35, 4.5 and 10.5). If the bullet breaks, the smaller fragment typically deviates downwards. The fragmentation depends on the construction of the bullet and the velocity; with impact velocities below 600 m/s, no FMJ deforms or breaks apart. If the bullet does fragment then the primary temporary cavity is larger than is the case with an intact bullet. This represents a much larger transfer of kinetic energy and has important clinical repercussions. Distance The sketch shows the position of the bullet and the extent of the shooting channel at different phases. The graph represents the transfer of kinetic energy along the bullet track: bullet fragmentation occurs at the peak of energy transfer.

{"text": "\n## Deforming rifle bullets: dum-dum7 3.3.4\n\n Some bullets (e.g. hunting bullets) are constructed to always deform, for example by flattening: hollow-nosed, semi-jacketed (SJ), soft-pointed, etc. (Figure 3.7 e and f). These are usually grouped under the term \"dum-dum\" bullets and are illegal for military use according to international law. Deforming bullets are made to change their shape readily (\"mushrooming\"), thus increasing their cross section area, but without losing mass. The spent bullet weighs as much as the original. They are used mainly in handguns with a muzzle velocity below 450 m/s, and are available for domestic use (special police forces and criminals). Fragmenting bullets, on the other hand, break up and lose mass, and create a \"wall\" of particles, thus increasing the total effective area of cross section. They are used for hunting. Figure 3.18 demonstrates a semi-jacketed rifle bullet mushrooming immediately on impact with a soft medium. The increased cross section causes a greater bullet- medium interaction; the bullet slows down quickly, releasing kinetic energy very early. The narrow channel almost completely disappears and the temporary cavity occurs right after impact. At first, the cavity is almost cylindrical; it then decreases conically. 40 cm The principal difference between a full metal jacket and semi-jacketed bullet is at what depth of penetration the maximum energy transfer occurs in the shooting channel. The volume of the cavities is the same in both examples in Figure 3.19 indicating equal transfer of kinetic energy. Penetration depth Penetration depth The Indian Ordnance Department of the British Army developed a bullet for its colonial troops in 1897 at an 7 ammunition factory in the town of Dum Dum, north-east of Calcutta (Kolkata) because the previous one was judged to be ineffectual and caused insignificant injuries. The bullet had a round nose with a full metal jacket of copper-nickel covering a lead core, with the exception of 1 mm at its tip where the lead was bare The bullet was used against the Afridi Afghans in 1897 – 98, and again against the Mahdi Army at Omdurman, Sudan, in 1898 with devastating effect. The bullet was judged to be \"inhumane\" according to the Declaration of St Petersburg of 1868 and was banned by the Hague Convention of 1899. Projectiles causing unnecessary injuries (\"maux superflus\") were not allowed. As an example, the Conventions mentioned projectiles whose metal jacket did not fully cover the lead core. Since then, all projectiles possessing the same qualities (deformation by expanding or flattening easily) have received the collective name of dum-dum."}

On impact, the biggest cross section comes into contact with the target surface, immediately transferring a maximum of kinetic energy. No yaw or tumbling occurs in the target. 40 cm The shooting channel always has the largest cavity diameter at the entry, and is larger than the diameter of the fragment.

The tissue structure of the human body is far too complex for a laboratory model to duplicate injuries. Tissue simulants have the disadvantage of being homogeneous media; living tissue is not, as described later. The laboratory results must be compared to clinical cases for confirmation and this has been the procedure adopted by the ICRC and by other wound ballistics experts including the Armasuisse laboratory. In the real world of clinical practice there are so many variables involved that one cannot be predictive; the surgeon cannot say with certainty that such and such a bullet will always result in a specific wound.

In biological tissues, the \"permanent wound cavity\" of the shooting channel is the definitive tissue damage after all temporary effects have been taken into account. This is the wound channel that the surgeon sees and is the final result of the crush, laceration and stretch of the tissues. 8"}
{"text": "\n## Crush and laceration injury\n\n A projectile causes physical compression and forcing apart of tissues along the shooting channel – crushing and laceration. This is the immediate physical effect of a penetrating foreign body; the bullet damages tissues with which it comes into direct contact, cutting through tissues as would a knife. This tissue damage is permanent and found in the final wound. This is the principal effect caused by low- and medium- energy weapons, such as handgun bullets. 8 Much confusion has been created in surgical literature by authors calling the immediate crush damage of the phase 1 narrow shooting channel the \"permanent cavity\", as distinct from the \"temporary cavity\" where stretch damage occurs. In this manual, in accordance with the Armasuisse laboratory, the permanent wound cavity is the channel that remains at the end of the wounding process and constitutes the sum of crush, laceration and stretch injury. MECHANISMS OF INJURY At higher energies, when a bullet tumbles or deforms, a larger area of tissue is exposed to its effective cross section and suffers crush. The track left behind by crush is not equal along its length, but increases with bullet yaw in the tissues."}
{"text": "\n## Stretch injury\n\n Tissues have an elastic tensile strength that resists stretching. When a certain limit is reached, capillaries are ruptured and contusion of the tissues occurs. Beyond a critical limit, the tissues themselves are torn, just as laboratory gelatine shows fracture lines. The tissue damage from stretch may be permanent or only temporary. Tissue stretch occurs during cavitation, which takes place in all projectile wounds, whatever the energy, type or motion of the projectile, and at all points along the entire shooting channel. There is even a minor cavitation effect during the phase 1 narrow channel. The volume of the cavity is determined by the amount of energy dissipated and the tissue elasticity-resistance. This cavitation stretch performs work on tissues that have already been injured by crush and laceration, thus adding to the local immediate damage. In low- or medium-energy projectiles wounds, it is minimal. When a bullet tumbles (or deforms or fragments), the release of kinetic energy is much greater and is superimposed on bigger tissue crush; the large phase 2 temporary cavity is the result: a momentary massive displacement of tissue in all directions away from the track of the bullet. As in gelatine, the cavity pulsates: an elastic acceleration followed by a deceleration of the surrounding tissues: a shearing action. The near vacuum in the cavity sucks in air, contaminants and foreign bodies (textile strands from the clothing, dust, etc.), and bacteria, through the entry and any exit wound. In high-energy wounds the volume of the temporary cavity can be up to 25 times that of the permanent cavity left behind, and anywhere between 10 and 15 times the diameter of the bullet. Although this volume is proportional to the kinetic energy dissipated, and will affect the amount of tissue damage, other factors related to the tissues can be even more important in determining the actual extent of injury."}
{"text": "\n## 3.4.3 Tissue factors\n\n Resistance to crush, laceration and stretch differs widely among different types of tissues and according to anatomic structures. Tissue elasticity and heterogeneity are important factors in determining much of the bullet–tissue interaction."}
{"text": "\n## Tissue elasticity\n\n Elastic tissues tolerate stretch well, but may still suffer severe crush. The lung and skin have excellent tolerance, and leave relatively little residual damage after stretch. Skeletal muscle and the bowel wall of empty intestines have good tolerance. The brain, liver, spleen, and kidney are non-elastic, and shatter when stretched. Fluid- filled organs (heart, full bladder, full stomach and intestines) react badly owing to the incompressibility of the fluid contents; they may even “explode”. Nerves and tendons are mobile and blood vessels elastic; they are usually pushed out of the way by the cavitation. Cortical bone is dense and rigid and resists stretch. However, if the cavitation accelerates a large enough muscle mass with sufficient energy the bone is bent beyond its tensile strength and breaks; it may even be shattered violently, especially the diaphysis of a long bone. This phenomenon is an example of a fracture without a direct hit by a bullet. The same mechanism takes place during fracture from a blunt injury, except that the energy transfer bending the bone occurs from the outside."}
{"text": "\n## Tissue heterogeneity\n\n Apart from these considerations of tissue elasticity, there is the particular local anatomy to consider. A block of gelatine approximates skeletal muscle in its elasticity and density, but it is homogeneous.

Not only does each anatomic element have a different elastic tensile strength, but the mixture of elements has its own interactive properties. The various interactions of projectile, soft-tissue organs and bony fragments can become very complicated."}
{"text": "\n## Bound together and boundaries\n\n How tightly tissues are bound together, and to nearby structures such as fascia of varying thickness, also affects the amount of permanent damage a cavity stretch can leave behind. If one side of a structure is fixed and the other side has free movement, a shearing force develops. Fascial planes may also serve as channels for the dissipation  of energy – path of least resistance – to more remote tissues. Boundaries limiting the pulsation of a temporary cavity can be very significant. They include not only fascia and aponeuroses, but also hollow, fluid-filled organs: the brain in the rigid cranium, the heart, the full urinary bladder. An empty stomach will be simply transfixed by a stable bullet. The same bullet will cause a full stomach to “explode”. A graphic laboratory example of boundary effect is found in Figures 3.26.1 and 3.26.2. The two pictures show the results with a high-energy bullet cavity. The apple literally explodes after passage of the bullet. Note that the cavitation effect always follows the passage of the bullet; it is not simultaneous. Clinically, these effects can create apparent paradoxes. For example, a heavy and slow bullet can cause a more severe wound in highly elastic tissue, such as lung, than a lighter, faster bullet with more kinetic energy. The heavier, slower bullet produces more crush. The faster, lighter one uses up more energy in creating the temporary cavity, which leaves little residual damage. However, the faster and lighter bullet will create more damage in less elastic tissue (liver, brain), which cannot accommodate stretch as well."}

Most of the damage in the majority of ballistic wounds is due to direct crush and laceration. A number of macroscopic and microscopic changes occur. Severe vasoconstriction blanches the skin around the entry wound for 3 – 4 hours owing to the stretch. This is followed by a hyperaemic reaction that lasts up to 72 hours. 9 Fackler ML, Breteau DVM et al. Open wound drainage versus wound excision in treating the modern assault rifle round.

This has obvious consequences for wound management and the extent of surgery necessary (see Chapter 10 ). Bacteria are also seen within the permanent cavity.

{"text": "\n## The case of bone\n\n The direct impact of a bullet on bone is different according to where this occurs in the shooting channel. Three clinical situations arise, corresponding to the phases of the shooting channel. In the first case, the stable bullet of phase 1 causes a small \"drill- hole\" fracture. A small cavitation occurs, and the bone then collapses on itself. The final hole is smaller than the calibre of the bullet (Figure 3.29.2). In the second case, the bone is broken into multiple fragments owing to a higher release of kinetic energy from the larger cross section of the tumbling bullet during phase 2 (Figure 3.33). Each bone fragment creates its own local crush and laceration damage; the muscle is cut up in between the fragments. Afterwards, the temporary cavitation acts on this shredded muscle with lowered tensile strength; the cavity is greater and the final remaining wound channel is larger. The bone fragments always remain within the temporary cavity; they do not produce a new second wound outside the cavity. Detached pieces of muscle and the bone fragments are found inside the final wound, which is usually very severe. This is of obvious clinical relevance to the management of these wounds.

{"text": "\n## Disruption of the bullet and secondary fragments\n\n At impact velocities above 700 m/s, standard FMJ bullets tend to fragment in tissues at short shooting distances (30 – 100 m). Some of these fragmented pieces make their own track of crushed and lacerated tissue. Tissue disruption from bullet fragmentation is then synergistic: the tissues are multiply perforated by the metallic fragments, thus weakening the tissue's cohesiveness, before being subjected to cavitation stretch. The injury is severe. The same phenomenon occurs with shotgun Clinically, an X-ray showing a \"shower of lead\" from a fragmented bullet should alert the surgeon to the likelihood of a large transfer of kinetic energy to the tissues and consequent severe damage (Figures 3.35, 4.5 and 10.5). Other secondary missiles are objects to which the bullet imparts sufficient motion through the transfer of kinetic energy. These may include foreign bodies such as a belt buckle, a small stone, the metallic contents of a pocket, or the contents of flak jackets – or autologous bodies including the teeth, dental fillings or dentures, and bone fragments (once an ICRC surgeon found a piece of a shattered mandible A projectile in flight is accompanied by a series of waves propagated at the speed of sound (330 m/s in air). When the projectile strikes a person, this sonic wave is propagated throughout the body at the speed of sound in tissue (4 times the speed of sound in air). This sonic shock wave may have high amplitude but is of very short duration, not enough to move or injure tissue. However, researchers have noted microscopic cell changes as well as stimulation of peripheral nerves, if the pressure generated reaches a certain threshold. The nerve stimulation occurs immediately, while the cell damage is apparent only after 6 hours. Occasional, short-lived neurapraxia appears to be the oly clinically relevant damage."}
{"text": "\n## 3.4.7  Pressure wave in tissues and blood vessels\n\n This pressure wave is part of the phenomenon of the temporary cavitation and should not be confused with the sonic shock wave. The outer boundary of the cavity consists of a \"front\" of compressed tissues, which creates a pressure wave at the limit of tissue compression. The wave develops fully only after the cavitation and decreases with distance. It is measured in milliseconds (1,000 times longer than the shock wave). The pressure wave can thus disrupt capillaries or provoke their thrombosis, rupture a full bowel or the liver, and cause retinal detachment and fractures, at a distance from the cavity. MECHANISMS OF INJURY Additionally, blood vessels contained in tissues are squeezed and emptied suddenly with tissue compression. This creates a hydraulic pressure wave in the column of blood that is propagated away from the site of cavitation. The clinical result of this pressure wave along the course of a blood vessel can be thrombosis or dissection of the intima or muscularis."}
{"text": "\n## 3.4.8 Fragment wounds\n\n Their non-aerodynamic shape means that fragments rapidly lose speed in air. If initial velocities are reported to be up to 2,000 m/s, the impact velocity in survivors is usually much lower. If the person is very close to the exploding device, the penetration is deep. If very far away, the casualty is only \"peppered\" superficially with multiple fragments. Fragments do not tumble in the tissues, as was demonstrated in the tissue simulants. Thus, most tissue damage is due to crush. At the end of the trajectory, the sharp edges of an irregular fragment will cut tissues. By contrast, a bullet tends to push aside tissues at the end of its track. The wound profile resembles a cone of tissue destruction , with the largest diameter at the entry since most energy is dissipated at the surface. The diameter of the entry wound can be anywhere between 2 and 10 times the calibre of the fragment, depending on the impact velocity, mass and shape (Figures 3.36.1 – 3.36.3). Large, slow fragments penetrate and crush tissues more; small, fast ones result in more stretch. This means that a large and slow fragment tends to cause the same type of wound whatever the tissues, while the wounds of small and fast fragments vary according to tissue elasticity. Nonetheless, in all fragment wounds the extent of tissue damage is always larger than the fragment.

The sharp and irregular surfaces of fragments carry pieces of skin and clothing material into the wounds. As with gunshot wounds, fragment wounds show different zones of tissue injury.

The uneven distribution of tissue damage in the concussion and contusion zones has been described as “jumping” or a “mosaic”. 11 This is probably because energy has been transferred both along (crush effect) and across (shear and stretch effect) muscle fibres.

Nothing can replace a good clinical examination of the patient and the wound. The extent of the crush and stretch is well represented by the grades of the Red Cross Wound Score (see Chapter 4). The injurious effects on the patient, however, involve even more than the local pathology. As with all trauma and many diseases, the physiological and psychological state of the victim must be taken into consideration as well. Fit young military personnel, well-trained for their role in warfare and mentally prepared for being wounded, and wounding and killing others, are not the same as civilians. Psychological status cannot be calculated by ballistics. Only these factors can explain the many anecdotes of a person being shot – even several times – and yet continuing to advance or fight in combat. 3 Chapter 4 RED CROSS WOUND SCORE AND CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM WAR SURGERY 4.1 4.1.1 4.1.2 4.1.3 4.1.4 4.2 4.2.1 4.2.2 4.3 4.3.1 4.3.2 4.4 4.5 4.6 RED CROSS WOUND SCORE AND CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM Applications of the RCWS and classification system 83 Assessment of and communication about war wounds in a standardized scheme 83 Establishing a scientific approach to war surgery 83 Surgical and hospital audit 83 Wound information from the field 83 Principles of the Red Cross Wound Score 84 Examples 86 Notes on wound scoring 87 Grading and typing of wounds 88 Wound Grade according to amount of tissue damage 88 Typing wounds according to the injured tissues 88 Wound classification 88 Clinical examples 89 Conclusions 91 RED CROSS WOUND SCORE"}
{"text": "\n## 4.1\n\n \n## Applications of the RCWS and classification system\n\n Surgeons from civilian practice usually have no previous experience of managing war wounds. Even experienced surgeons often do not find it possible to tell the true extent of tissue damage. As noted in Chapter 3, ballistics studies show that there is not a uniform pattern or degree of wounding. Preparation for war surgery involves an understanding of the translation of the kinetic energy of a wounding projectile into The severity of such wounds depends on the degree of tissue damage and the structure(s) that may have been injured: thus, the clinical significance of a wound depends on its size and site. The Red Cross Wound Score (RCWS) and classification system¹ is based on the features of the wound itself, and not on the weaponry or the presumed velocity or kinetic energy of the missile. Any wound classification system will aid the surgeon if it helps to assess the severity of the injury, influences surgical management, predicts outcome, and provides for an  accurate database that can be used in comparative studies. The RCWS goes a fair way to fulfilling these criteria."}
{"text": "\n## 4.1.1\n\n \n## Assessment of and communication about war wounds in a standardized scheme\n\n The Wound Score is a useful clinical tool to communicate the severity of the wound to staff and colleagues without having to remove the dressings. It is also an element to take into consideration for the purposes of triage."}
{"text": "\n## 4.1.2\n\n \n##  Establishing a scientific approach to war surgery\n\n The RCWS permits comparison of treatments and prognoses of similar wounds. An analogy can be made with the TNM (tumour, node, metastasis) staging of different cancers, allowing comparison of treatment regimes for a similar pathology. In the case of a gunshot wound to the thigh, treatment and prognosis will differ according to the amount of tissue damage, degree of bone comminution and whether there is injury to the femoral vessels. Other wound scoring systems are primarily devised for blunt trauma. The presence of a penetrating wound in these systems often indicates a “serious” wound, with little further nuance."}
{"text": "\n## 4.1.3\n\n \n## Surgical and hospital audit\n\n Wound Scores can be used to evaluate quality of care when combined with information on length of hospital stay, number of operations performed per patient or units of blood used, morbidity and mortality. An example relating to the adequacy of primary wound surgery is the number and cause of deaths associated with non-vital wounds, or the number of operations performed per patient for each Wound Grade."}
{"text": "\n## 4.1.4\n\n \n## Wound information from the field\n\n ICRC surgical teams treat thousands of war-wounded every year. Analysis of a larger number of scored wounds will eventually clarify the relationship between experimental laboratory wound ballistics and the clinical management of war wounds. Worthy of note is the fact that information gained in the field served as a scientific basis for the campaign to ban anti-personnel landmines, thus promoting new standards in international humanitarian law. This chapter is largely based on the brochure The Red Cross Wound Classification, Revised Edition, by Dr R. M. Coupland. The ICRC Master Surgeons Workshop held in Geneva in 2002 revised the original Wound Score (see Introduction).  WAR SURGERY The width of two fingers is approximately the length of a military rifle bullet. Gunshot wound: F1 fracture of the ulna. Gunshot wound: F2 fracture of the femur.

{"text": "\n## 4.2\n\n \n## Principles of the Red Cross Wound Score\n\n Wounds are given a six-figure Score according to several parameters. The Scores can then be translated into a classification system: • grading of the wound according to the severity of tissue injury and The RCWS is intended for quick and easy use in the field, its simplicity especially useful under conditions of stress. It is a simple clinical system that requires no extra equipment or sophisticated procedures.

{"text": "\n## 4.2.2 Notes on wound scoring\n\n 1. When it is impossible to differentiate between the entry and the exit wounds, put a (?) between the E and X Scores. 2. With multiple wounds, only the two most serious are scored. 3. If a wound cannot be scored (unclassifiable), U/C is written on the Score. This applies to a minority of wounds. 4. When one missile causes two separate wounds (e.g. through the arm and into the chest), the 2 separate Scores are joined by a bracket. 5. Include penetrating wounds only, not superficial tangential skin wounds; e.g. skin wound 20 cm long and 1 cm wide but without penetration deep to the fascia. 6. Estimation of the cavity: the width of two fingers is approximately the length of a bullet from a military assault rifle (Figure 4.1). If the permanent cavity of a wound admits two fingers before surgical excision, then something other than crush by a bullet travelling sidelong must have taken place, i.e. stretch and laceration by cavitation. A C1 wound is likely to present significant tissue damage whatever the cause. 7. Fracture severity: it is inevitable that some wounds fall between F1 and F2, but for simplicity this is not accurately defined here. A further refinement is given in Volume 2. An example of a clinically insignificant comminution (F1) is a wound with a comminuted fibula but with an intact tibia (Figure 4.2.3). 8. A vital injury implies a more dangerous wound involving a surgical task in addition to simple wound management (e.g. craniotomy, pleural drainage or thoracotomy, laparotomy). VH includes the popliteal and brachial vessels but not those more distal. The outcome of injuries to the head, thorax or abdomen, or causing massive peripheral haemorrhage, is only partly determined by the clinical size of the wounds as determined by the RCWS (see below). 9.   Metallic fragments: note the difference between an intact bullet (M1) and a fragmented bullet (M2), as shown in Figure 4.5. If the full metal jacket of a bullet has been disrupted and the lead interior has leaked out as fragments, this indicates a severe stress on the bullet and a large transfer of kinetic energy to the tissues (Figures 3.35 and 10.5). Note also the difference between multiple metallic fragments from a grenade or shell (Figure 4.6) – which are common and do not necessarily represent a large transfer of kinetic energy – and a disrupted and fragmented bullet, which does. If there are numerous metallic fragments, do not count them; only mark M = 2. 10. If X-rays are not available the RCWS is still valid. The F Score is judged clinically and the M parameter omitted, or included if fragments are found during surgical excision. X-rays should not be performed just to fill in the M and F Scores. 1. Traumatic amputation of limb (Figure 4.7): this injury is often seen with anti-personnel blast mines. The open end of the amputated limb equals a combined entry-exit, whose diameter represents the sum of E+X. It is equivalent to a cavity (C = 1), while the vaporized missing part of the limb qualifies as a severe fracture (F = 2). The level of traumatic amputation (above or below the knee or elbow) will determine if the Vital structure Score is 0 or H. Figure 4.5 Disrupted and fragmented bullet: M2. Multiple shell fragments: M2. Figure 4.7  WAR SURGERY 4.3 Grading and typing of wounds Once scored, the wound can be graded according to severity (E, X, C and F), and typed according to tissue type (F and V). The wound should be graded according to severity. Grade 1 E + X is less than 10 cm with Scores C 0 and F 0 or F 1. (Low energy transfer.) Grade 2 E + X is less than 10 cm with Scores C 1 or F 2. (High energy transfer.)"}
{"text": "\n## Grade 3\n\n E + X is 10 cm or more, with Scores C 1 or F 2. (Massive energy transfer.) These Grades represent the outcome of a simple clinical assessment that corresponds to the effective transfer of kinetic energy of projectiles to body tissues. Large wounds are more serious and require greater resources; this is particularly true of wounds to the limbs."}
{"text": "\n## 4.3.2  Typing wounds according to the injured tissues\n\n Once scored , the wound can be typed according to tissue structures. Type ST Soft-tissue wounds: F 0 and V 0.

Further refinement of the fracture type is possible, especially for assessing the extent of bone defect. This can be useful in a specialized study of war wounds with fractures (see Volume 2)."}
{"text": "\n## 4.5\n\n \n## Clinical examples\n\n Epidemiological studies from the ICRC surgical database of over 32,000 patients have shown that the Red Cross Wound Score gives excellent prognostic results for surgical workload and morbidity due to war wounds. As demonstrated in the statistical analysis in Chapter 5, the Wound Grade is highly relevant to the number of operations per patient. This is particularly the case for wounds to the extremities. Vital Wound Scores to the extremities (V = H) also give good measures for mortality and the One of the avowed weaknesses of the Classification concerns the prognostic mortality of vital central wounds. It is in the anatomic nature of the brain, heart and great vessels that even a very small wound from a projectile with low kinetic energy can be lethal if a vital centre is injured. The RCWS does classify such wounds as “potentially” lethal; that is why, by definition, they are categorized as “vital” injuries. However, a Grade 1 wound can be just as lethal as a Grade 3 wound depending on what particular structure is hit: medulla oblongata rather than temporal cortex;  ascending aorta rather than lung What is certain is that for most Grade 3 wounds to the head, thorax and abdomen, pre- hospital mortality is bound to be high. Without autopsies of those killed in action (KIA), analysis can only be made of the relatively few “survivors” who reach hospital; for them, wound Grade is not significant with respect to mortality (Tables 4.4 – 4.6). Thus, the outcome of injuries to the head, thorax and abdomen are not only, nor even mainly, determined by the clinical size of the wound as defined by the RCWS. The various factors affecting the mortality from vital wounds; e.g. for the abdomen, number of organs injured, degree of faecal contamination, intraoperative blood loss, delay in operative treatment, etc., will be discussed in Volume 2. Number Deaths % mortality Grade 1 75 14 18.7 Grade 2 21.4 70 15  Grade 3 3.3 Grade 1 Grade 2  Grade 3 Number Deaths % mortality 82 4.9 4 4.9 41 2 0 Table 4.4 Mortality from head and neck injuries (VN) : N = 154 (ICRC Kabul, 1990-92).

Nonetheless, as explained in Chapter 5, a distinction should be made in patient databases between superficial and penetrating wounds to the head, thorax and abdomen to allow for a better analysis of results of treatment. Using the RCWS enables this.  WAR SURGERY E1 x0 c0 f0 v0' m1 E3 x1 c1 F0 v0 m0 Two fragment wounds to the thigh. The surgeon is assessing the larger wound cavity.

{"text": "\n## Conclusions 4.6\n\n The Red Cross Wound Score enables medical staff to translate war wounds into surgical lesions rather than weaponry phenomena. It refines the heterogeneity of wounds and helps define them according to their clinical significance, and it is a good indicator of tissue damage due to the transfer of kinetic energy in penetrating wounds. The limitations of the scoring system are recognized; complete accuracy cannot be obtained. It should be emphasized that the RCWS is for rapid use under adverse conditions, including extreme stress, and uses no additional equipment or sophisticated technology. The simplicity and advantages of the RCWS outweigh any disadvantages that may occasionally be introduced by observer error. As with any classification system, the more experience gained in using the RCWS, the more accurate the results and the fewer the observer errors.

Questions of general methodology and definitions will begin the surgical study, and will be followed by a presentation of historical and ICRC experience and results. Relevant clinical conclusions will be emphasized throughout, as will recurring problems of methodology. For the purpose of this discussion the authors refer directly only to the ICRC's experience in armed conflict and the importance of epidemiological studies in determining ICRC surgical activities.

{"text": "\n## Historical perspective\n\n It is commonly said that contemporary warfare causes more civilian victims than military, and that the public health effects are greater than those caused by trauma. In all major conflicts over the last one hundred years, with few exceptions (World War I), civilians have become a direct target and accounted for one-half to two- thirds of the casualties. “Throughout history there have been many small local wars, often involving wholesale starvation and occasionally the elimination of whole populations  or tribes.\"  G.W. Odling-Smeel The heavy civilian toll in contemporary conflicts is therefore not new. Nevertheless, in certain recent conflicts – whether revolutionary wars of national liberation, civil wars, territorial and border disputes, or peasant uprisings – the destabilization of political, social, and economic infrastructures, the destruction of cultural symbols and institutions, and the psychological terrorizing of civilians have become explicit political and military goals. A number of reports have indicated that the indirect effects of social disruption have caused two to fifteen times more civilian deaths 1 Odling-Smee GW. Ibo civilian casualties in the Nigerian civil war. BM/ 1970; 2: 592 – 596.

{"text": "\n## Pathologies and the pathology of the health system\n\n Complex emergencies during armed conflict in poor countries tend to cause death by endemic communicable disease and malnutrition. In more developed countries, increased mortality rates due to trauma and chronic disease dominate. The lack of access to care, either because of poverty, the disorganization of the medical system, or for reasons of security, aggravates the problems. To pre-conflict poverty and fragile health services are added the problems of the collapse of medical supply and distribution, the targeting of hospitals and clinics in violation of medical neutrality, and the neglect or abandonment of preventive health programmes. In addition, health professionals are often amongst the first people to flee a conflict zone. Having to provide for war trauma also means a greater investment in curative services to the disadvantage of the preventive. The entire health system becomes organized around the conflict and there is an imbalance between the needs  of victims and the available public health services (Figure 5.1). Moreover, all too often, increased military spending in a country at war is to the detriment of social and health investments. Another recent development is the creation of a war economy controlled by criminalized military networks. The extraction of diamonds and other precious stones, oil, timber, and various minerals,  the trafficking of narcotics, and sheer banditry, take a further and severe social toll. A public health approach shows the full range of the humanitarian consequences of the use of anti-personnel landmines, especially during the post-conflict period. In addition to death and disability, there are the long-term socio-economic effects of disrupted economic activity through the loss of farmland, livestock, water resources, and industrial capacity because of the presence of landmines. Zwi A, Ugalde A. Towards an epidemiology of political violence in the third world. Soc Sci Med 1969: 28: 633 – 2 642. Cited in Lautze S, et al., 2004. 3 From Perrin P. War and Public Health: A Handbook. Geneva: ICRC; 1996. EPIDEMIOLOGY Landmines and other UXO (unexploded ordnance) are not the only weapons left over after war. Demobilized combatants with guns are not often successfully reintegrated into social and economic life: criminal violence replaces political violence; peace combined with high criminality offers little respite from war. And the social and economic costs continue to cast a shadow over everyday life. In addition, one must count the social costs of deliberate physical, psychological, and sexual abuse as methods of warfare. Torture and rape have profound and long-term consequences. Even among classical armies of industrialized countries, disease caused more deaths than combat until World War II. Mortality does not tell the whole story, however. Serious disease continues to affect modern armies, still accounting for high rates of non-availability of personnel for military duty. Of course, certain natural environments (jungle, high mountains) increase the incidence of non-battle pathology."}
{"text": "\n## 5.2.3 The burden of war-wounded civilians\n\n Although trauma may account for only a small number of all war-related deaths in a given civilian population, the relative proportions of mortality and morbidity due to disease and trauma vary over time and between different war zones; refugee camps are different again. In some conflicts, the burden of war trauma is greater than the public health consequences. This was the case in the wars in the former Yugoslavia (1991 – 99) in Lebanon (1975 – 90), and Rwanda (1994), among others. One must also take into consideration the relatively small population of certain countries; a limited number of deaths may represent a proportionately high death toll."}
{"text": "\n## In some conflicts, the burden of the war-wounded is greater than the consequences on public health.\n\n The type of combat may place civilians at greater risk and war casualties may overwhelm civilian medical services, even in situations where the public health effects are greater than the direct effects of trauma (Biafra 1967 – 70, Uganda 1987, Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1997 to the time of writing). Mortality data, however, do not reflect the extent and severity of war injuries. Morbidity and disability rates due to injuries are testimony to the long-term socio- economic burdens."}
{"text": "\n## Demographics of the victims\n\n Historical military casualty statistics concern young, fit and healthy men. In the past, women were not close to combat in most classical armies; more recently, however, various revolutionary guerrilla groups have had female combatants. When a civilian population finds itself in the midst of war, the demographic profile of casualties is closer to its population pyramid.

Missing and displaced persons, constraints of time, lack of access to populations, and dangerous security situations, all create formidable problems for a limited number of qualified personnel to conduct proper studies. Furthermore, the distinction between civilian and military during a civil war is not always obvious. The ratio of military to civilian wounded and sick may be very sensitive political and military information, easily exploited for propaganda purposes by the various antagonists. In an attempt to prevent this, should ICRC delegates determine that civilians are being expressly targeted by combatants, the organization undertakes specific démarches regarding the conduct of hostilities with the authorities concerned through its traditional confidential procedures. Many authors have recently written about the public health effects of armed conflict and complex emergencies.

{"text": "\n## 5.3.2 Preparation of the institution\n\n The institution involved – military sanitary services, public health ministry, ICRC or any other humanitarian agency – must also be prepared. The standardization of protocols and knowledge of the workload permits the establishment of ready-made kits of equipment, medicines and supplies that are easily deployed in an emergency situation as a rapid response to well-known needs. This facilitates the setting up of a surgical hospital to treat the victims of war. 5 Preparation also implies choosing the correct profile of surgeon required, and training him or her to understand the context, the pathology, and the functioning of the institution in which they will be working, as well as the prevailing clinical protocols. Knowing what kind of patient comes through the hospital door helps in planning a response: allocation of medical resources and personnel and the training of surgeons."}

Professional standards must be maintained, even when resources are limited. • The adequacy of the clinical protocols in use must be put to the test: changes must be made in response to poor or unexpected outcomes. Many surgeons will be seeing war pathology for the first time, under conditions that do not resemble their routine work circumstances. At times, a strict and rigid application of protocols is • The adequacy of the chain of casualty care must also be put to the test: hospital as well as pre-hospital data helps to assess the efficiency of first-aid measures in the field and that of the evacuation system.

They are not alone in this belief. Health professionals were instrumental in gathering the epidemiological data from clinical studies to make the humanitarian argument for the banning of blinding laser In the field, ICRC delegations in areas of armed conflict monitor the compliance of belligerents with IHL. This is an essential element of the mandate of the ICRC to protect and assist the victims of armed conflict and promote respect for the law of war. Epidemiological studies, in both hospital and pre-hospital settings, can help in determining certain abuses of IHL. For example, mortality statistics can help elucidate  the occurrence of executions of prisoners of war being passed off as killed in combat. The ICRC then undertakes a series of confidential démarches with the offending party  in order to promote observance of humanitarian norms. Other actors may do likewise, in compliance with their humanitarian responsibilities. 7 The ICRC warns, nonetheless, against the possibility of exploitation and manipulation  of statistical epidemiological studies for political purposes."}
{"text": "\n## 5.3.5  The surgeon and the specialized literature\n\n \"Statistics can be made to say whatever you want them to say\" is a well-worn cliché. It is therefore important for the surgeon reading the vast literature on war surgery to understand what is being said, what the shortcomings are, and what some of the traps and pitfalls are. Most of the war surgery literature consists of large retrospective studies written by military surgeons of industrialized countries; some of the exceptions are included in the Selected bibliography at the end of this volume. Most surgeons are not well trained in epidemiology or statistical methods, and civilian surgeons are usually not knowledgeable about military terminology. Thus, the surgeon facing the new experience of dealing with the war-wounded who wishes to read up on the topic will  often find a bewildering vocabulary and methodology. Added to the differences between war and civilian trauma are the disparities between the experience of ICRC interventions (and other humanitarian agencies) and ministry of public health structures on the one hand, and classical military medical services on  the other. The rest of this chapter deals with some of these differences and disparities. 6 Respectively, Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons 1995 (Protocol IV to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, 1980), and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, 1997, known as the Ottawa Convention 7  Burnham G, Lafta R, Doocy S, Roberts L.

{"text": "\n## 5.4.2\n\n \n## Problems of data collection\n\n Trauma registries are notoriously difficult to maintain during war. Fatigue and lack of time, a shortage of trained staff, and the personal danger that medical staff must often confront complicate the keeping of statistics. The administrative personnel and time and effort required to keep up full documentation and archives can appear to be a luxury when faced with the stress of caring for battle casualties. In an article on American casualties during the war in Viet Nam, based on data obtained from a statistical record filled out by physicians in Viet Nam at the time of discharge or transfer, the author made the following telling comment. “ Many of the physicians who filled out these forms recognized that they were frequently completed under stress, by command, and without enthusiasm, by  physicians who considered it another thankless task, and therefore the accuracy of some of the data may be Besides the problems of data collection mentioned with respect to public health statistics and the displacement of populations, other discrepancies and difficulties appear when dealing with a retrospective analysis of hospital-based data. • The quantity and quality of data from different hospitals are irregular. • Initial admission data, operating theatre observations, and ward medical records for individual patients do not always match. • The management of casualties at different points in a military chain of evacuation compounds reporting problems, particularly with respect to patient outcome. • Access to medical care for the wounded – especially civilians or combatants in a civil war or during irregular guerrilla warfare – is not always available or must be done “in secret”. • Patients may disappear from the hospital before completing their treatment • Families do not always bring their dead for registration. As mentioned before, one must also always consider the political and military sensitivity of trauma information; ICRC health personnel have on occasion been accused of being \"spies\"because they were asking a hospital director for admission statistics. 8 Hardaway RM III.

{"text": "\n## Who is being counted and where?\n\n Are casualties calculated at the point of wounding, at first-aid posts, first echelon or referral hospitals? The total number of wounded will depend on which level of the evacuation chain is counting, and what happens to them after injury. The wounded that arrive at hospitals – where most studies are made – are only a sample of the casualties; they do not represent the total reality of war. Many studies in the military literature, even when dealing with the same war, define the wounded differently. One example: for World War II, the United States Surgeon General's Statistical Health Report indicated 724,000 wounded and 228,000 battle- related deaths among American troops; a fatality rate of 23.9%. The Adjutant General’s Report gave the figure of 593,000 battle injuries and 235,000 deaths; a rate of 28.4%. The latter report excluded the lightly wounded. 9 Retrospective analyses do not always indicate which figure is being used. Studies do not always make clear if all superficial and light injuries are excluded or not from the calculations. To state the obvious: a scalp laceration is not the same as an open wound to the brain. The reader should note that non-penetrating head, chest, and abdominal injuries are not always clearly differentiated from penetrating ones. The use of the Red Cross Wound Score permits this distinction (see Chapter 4). Similarly, studies of the anatomic distribution of wounds, the wounding agent, and delay in evacuation do not always state specifically whether the authors are dealing with the survivors only, or with total combat casualties comprising the dead as well as 9 Carey ME.

{"text": "\n##  ICRC EXPERIENCE\n\n In Kisangani, a city of 600,000 inhabitants in the remote east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, major fighting broke out in June 2000. Hostilities lasted seven days. One week later, visiting ICRC delegates recorded that 4 hospitals and 62 clinics had registered 1,691 wounded; 369 were still hospitalized (over 90 % civilians, most military casualties had been evacuated). The remaining casualties were under ambulatory care. It was impossible to determine the number killed. Almost a month later, a total of 2,393 casualties had been registered and 248 were still hospitalized. The vast majority of these patients were so superficially wounded that, had they been living in a rural environment far from a health facility, they would never have presented. These are the civilian equivalent of In nine and half months in Beirut, in 1976, an ICRC field hospital treated 1,289 war-wounded on an outpatient basis and another 696 in hospital. Similarly, three months of urban warfare in Monrovia, Liberia in 2003 saw 2,588 patients triaged by an ICRC surgical team, but only 1,015 were admitted to hospital. These examples tell us a great deal about the sociology of medical care during armed conflict and the effects on statistical results. In urban warfare, all civilian city- dwellers who are injured, even with very minor wounds, will seek medical treatment and be registered as war-wounded. Everybody goes to the hospital! Their reasons for presenting at a hospital or clinic are many: the medical sophistication of an urban population used to seeking curative care; the need for reassurance and being in a \"safe\" haven; hopes of financial compensation for all those injured; and the search for simple psychological support for a traumatized civilian population. Although the presence in hospitals and clinics of so many superficially wounded patients may not represent the true extent of the surgical workload, the burden on the emergency department (triage and first aid), nursing care (wound dressings), and non-clinical work (administration, registration, laundry and kitchen) can be overwhelming. Statistical analysis is both difficult and tedious under such circumstances (e.g. Monrovia) or almost impossible (e.g. Kisangani). Holcomb JB, Stansbury LG, Champion HR, Wade C, Bellamy RF.

{"text": "\n## 5.4.5\n\n \n##  Clinical and operational consequences and IHL\n\n A number of clinical and operational elements are significant as regards IHL. 1. For armies, the total number of casualties – soldiers removed from active participation in combat or support – and the overall lethality of the battlefield as represented by the case fatality rate (CFR) are important in terms of medical planning and allocation of fighting resources. For civilian health structures, the total number of casualties is only one measure  of the social and economic burden of war and the humanitarian consequences of the disorganization of society. 2. Killed in action (KIA) helps to determine the lethality of weapons and the type of combat. IHL concerns itself with the lethality of weapons systems and the conduct of hostilities. 3. The KIA and died of wounds (DOW) help determine the efficiency of the evacuation chain, which is dependent on access to the wounded, appropriate pre-hospital care (field triage and initial treatment), and transport logistics (evacuation time and access to a hospital for the wounded). Access of health personnel to the wounded and access of the latter to medical facilities are supposed to be guaranteed, in accordance with the protection conferred upon these persons by IHL.  The adequacy of medical treatment depends on the efficiency of the evacuation 4. system, the wounding mechanism and pathology (burns, blast, penetrating wounds, anti-personnel mines, etc.), and hospital competency. DOW and hospital mortality are the main indicators. Again, IHL is interested in the medical consequences of weapons systems. These various indices of mortality are important. However, they say nothing 5. about the severity of injury in survivors – morbidity and disability – or surgical workload that may have a greater long-term effect on civilian populations  and health structures. The number of operations per patient, infection rates, amputation rates, and length of hospitalization better define the severity of injury and hospital burden of war-wounded. The humanitarian consequences of such effects are of direct concern to IHL."}

{"text": "\n## Warfare scenarios\n\n The type of warfare greatly influences the kinds of wounds the surgeon sees and the anatomic distribution of injuries, which obviously affects hospital workload. The widespread use of anti-personnel blast mines in guerrilla and counter-insurgency warfare results in many traumatic amputations of the legs. Close combat with assault rifles causes many gunshot wounds with severe single injuries; shelling and bombing from a distance produce multiple fragment wounds, many of which are superficial. Major contemporary wars have seen a shift from gunshot wounds to fragment  injuries in the majority of casualties. In intercommunal strife, combatants in some societies engage in \"traditional\" warfare using machetes and pangas ; slash wounds to the head, neck and shoulders predominate and, secondarily, injuries to the forearms when the victim attempts to protect him or herself. Elsewhere, the ready availability of small arms means that \"traditional\" combat and cattle raiding are now undertaken with the use of AK-47 Kalashnikov rifles. Weapons systems available to belligerents vary. Classical armies of industrialized countries use air bombardment as well as artillery and armour, and their infantry is often fitted out with personal protective equipment. Classical armies of low-income EPIDEMIOLOGY countries tend to rely on infantry and artillery. Rural guerrilla formations depend on ambush with personal firearms and landmines; urban querrilla warfare is largely street fighting with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and, sometimes, short-range mortars. The weapons systems available to combatants can also change during the course of a war. The intensity of fighting, being on the offensive or defensive, losing or winning a given battle, the size of the unit actually engaged, and the percentage of soldiers really exposed to combat, all affect various combat casualty statistics. The numbers and relative proportion of civilian and military wounded and dead depend to a large extent on combat strategy and operational tactics, geographical site of fighting, access to medical care, and who is winning or losing."}
{"text": "\n## 5.5.2 Definitions of weapon-systems: methodology\n\n Some confusion arises in surgical literature because of differing categories and definitions for wounding agents and mechanism of injury: there is no universally accepted standard. \"Landmines\" include both anti-tank (ATM) and anti-personnel (APM); the two are usually not differentiated. ATM may be the agent of wounding, but the mechanism of injury can be blast, blunt, burn, or penetrating fragment. APM may be either a blast or a fragmentation device. The severity of the injury differs with the mechanism and aetiology, but this cannot always be determined from the categories in a study. The category of \"fragment wounds\" often groups together injuries from shells, bombs, and grenades, together with APM. The differences are important in terms of surgical management, however. Small, superficial wounds from preformed grenade fragments often do not require surgery; this is never the case for APM fragments (see Chapter 10).

Some count the “wounds” and not the “wounded”, so that sites of injury exceed the number of patients. Many studies do not clearly define the counting method; in some reports only survivors are counted, while for others total combat casualties – KIA and WIA – are included. Again, the methodology is nt always specified. Anatomic regions are not standardized either. Different studies use different definitions for anatomic regions; there is again no universal standard. Some report only the “torso”; “pelvis and buttocks” are under a separate category from “abdomen” in some, and included in others. To be truly accurate, head, face, and neck categories should be clearly separated, which they rarely are. These latter wounds represent very different clinical problems – traumatic brain injury, asphyxia, haemorrhage – and degrees of lethality. Anatomic distribution furthermore only indicates a potential threat; crude statistics often include superficial wounds, which is not a true indication of hospital workload and threat to life and limb.

{"text": "\n## Peak 1: immediate deaths\n\n Most deaths occur at the moment of injury or within minutes. These are due to overwhelming trauma incompatible with life (severe brain injury, massive haemorrhage). In war, in addition to severe injuries to the head and torso (heart, liver, and major blood vessels), some casualties suffer total body disruption or incineration through burns. It is estimated that 70% of deaths occur within five minutes, and little to nothing can be done for these patients, which represent about 17 – 20% of the severely wounded."}
{"text": "\n## Peak 2: early deaths\n\n These occur after the first minutes until the first few hours after injury. This peak gave rise to the idea of the \"golden hour\"; if certain measures were implemented rapidly, the patient could be saved. In war trauma, there are three major causes of early death: • continuing exsanguinating haemorrhage; • inadequate/impaired airway due to survivable penetrating head injury; • compromised breathing due to tension pneumothorax. Many of these early deaths are avoidable within this \"golden hour\" if adequate first- aid measures in the field are implemented in time."}
{"text": "\n## Peak 3: late deaths\n\n These occur a few days to weeks after injury and are the result of subsequent complications of infection, multiple organ failure and coagulopathy, and uncontrollable increased intra-cranial pressure due to post-injury cerebral oedema (closed injury). Good and early first-aid measures can decrease infectious and other complications in the setting of armed conflict where wounds are dirty and contaminated from the very beginning. Inadequate early care affects morbidity (sepsis, disability) as well as mortality. The understanding of this trimodal distribution of deaths stimulated an improvement in emergency medical services and patient transport in civilian settings. Rapid evacuation times and early advanced life support in many industrialized countries, in a bid to reach the injured during the “golden hour”, have reduced these three peaks to a bimodal profile: immediate deaths and late. 20  Trunkey DD.

{"text": "\n## Applicability to the military war-wounded\n\n The military have found that the trimodal distribution is relevant to armed conflict. They have tended to underline three categories of patients corresponding to what can be done under various operational scenarios in the field. This has an important influence on field triage categories. 1. Unsalvageable injuries: i.e. KIA for whom nothing can be done (17 – 20%). 2. 3. Moderate to minor injuries (65 – 70 %). One result of improved pre-hospital care and evacuation is that some casualties become DOW (early deaths) instead of being KIA (immediate deaths) while a few others are saved. The most important field measures undertaken include stopping haemorrhage from controllable bleeding and maintaining a patent airway and breathing by simple procedures."}
{"text": "\n##  ICRC EXPERIENCE\n\n Not all penetrating head injuries are so severe as to be incompatible with life. However, precarious pre-hospital care and long and difficult evacuation routes can result in large numbers of survivors of head injuries (WIA) succumbing later (DOW) because of inadequate control of the airway, resulting in asphyxia or vomiting and aspiration. This was the case during one recent war in Africa involving a \"classical\" army. Large numbers of patients with salvageable head injuries were dying during a three-day evacuation in the back of lorries travelling over dirt roads in the bush. There was no possibility of monitoring endotracheal intubation. An ICRC surgeon advised performing a tracheotomy in a front-line field hospital before evacuation, the only way to ensure an adequate airway under the circumstances in these comatose patients. The mortality rate for these cases was halved by this simple procedure."}

{"text": "\n## Dead = KIA plus DOW\n\n - = 1:4"}
{"text": "\n## Survivors = WIA minus DOW\n\n Many factors can distort the specific results under given circumstances, including: • the inclusion of minor wounds in the calculations – the famous methodological problem; • the tactical situation (note the 40% fatality rate of the Markale market place bombing mentioned above; burn injuries in tank crews or on ships; a successful surprise ambush, etc.); • the lethality of particular weapons systems (anti-personnel landmines, napalm, etc.); • any delay in medical evacuation; and • the execution of wounded prisoners in contravention of the laws of war. Improvement in personal protective equipment (body armour), better pre-hospital care, and the early availability of more aggressive surgery and enhanced intensive care facilities has changed the ratio in recent conflicts. For US armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, the dead to survivor ratio has become 1:8. 22 Effective body armour has decreased fatal wounds to the chest and abdomen, but increased wounds to the head and neck in survivors.

Sea and air warfare are different. It has long been recognized that different weapons systems have different lethality. In general, and over a large number of casualties the following percentages appear. • Military rifle bullets: 30 – 40 % lethality; or one death in every 3 – 4 wounded. • Randomly-formed fragments: 20% for shells and 10% for grenades. • Preformed fragments: 15 % for shells and 5 % for grenades. • Blast injury has a fatality of about 22%. Tactical considerations for distinct individual battles can change these figures. A well-laid ambush with small arms can easily result in more than 40% of a small patrol being killed."}
{"text": "\n## The particular case of anti-personnel landmines\n\n All studies indicate the heavy surgical and nursing burden of injuries due to anti- personnel landmines, especially blast mines. Specific types of APM – bounding mines that jump up one metre in the air before exploding – invariably kill their victim: lethality lies close to 100%. Public health studies and ICRC surveys in poor countries where APM have been widely used in rural areas with little or no organized evacuation system and limited surgical facilities (Mozambique, Somalia, Cambodia, Afghanistan and Angola) indicate a case fatality rate of well over 50 % for traumatic amputations due to APM. It is difficult to exclude the non-weapon factors in these studies and mortality statistics. Suffice it to say that the lethality of weapons includes their actual use in field conditions, and their total socio-economic and humanitarian effects. This is important in terms of IHL and was one of the significant factors in determining countries to negotiate the 1997 Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on their Destruction. 2   Holcomb JB, et al., 2006.

{"text": "\n## 5.7.5\n\n \n## Conclusions of clinical relevance\n\n From this analysis and further extrapolations a number of conclusions can be drawn. 1. Wounds to the head and torso are the most lethal; they represent most of the mortality. The great majority of survivors have injuries to the limbs; they represent 2. Despite the fact that the head represents only 9% of exposed body surface area, it accounts for a disproportionate number (25 %) of all battle casualties. The lethality of penetrating head wounds is approximately 75% and they account for slightly less than 50% of combat deaths (KIA + DOW), and about 8% of survivors. 3. Head wounds kill either through devastating brain injury or through asphyxiation of the comatose patient who would otherwise survive the injury.  Death through closed head injury is relatively greater in the civilian setting than 4. during armed conflict. 5. Uncontrolled exsanguinating haemorrhage accounts for another 50% or so of deaths. Most of these (80%) present central injuries to the thorax and/or abdomen, which require surgical facilities for control. The lethality of chest wounds is about 70%. 6. The other 20% of haemorrhage deaths are due to bleeding from peripheral, compressible blood vessels (half in the neck and half in the limbs). Thus, about 10 % of all deaths are due to haemorrhage from the limbs. 7. Death rates through haemorrhagic shock are higher in armed conflict than in the civilian trauma setting. 8. Little can be done medically for most immediate deaths and there is a threshold percentage of killed-in-action no matter how sophisticated the medical services are.  Conclusions for improvement of patient outcome 1. Some immediate and early deaths can be prevented by personal protective armour covering the torso. 2. Many early deaths can be prevented by simple measures to: • control limb haemorrhage; • relieve airway obstruction, especially in comatose patients after head injury; • relieve tension pneumothorax. 3. Some early deaths due to haemorrhage, particularly of the abdomen, can be prevented by rapid evacuation to a surgical facility."}
{"text": "\n## 5.8 The lethality of context: delay to treatment\n\n \n## 5.8.1 Historical developments\n\n Possibly one of the most important developments in combat casualty care over the last half-century has been improved pre-hospital care and the timely evacuation of the wounded to a surgical facility. Lasting days during much of World War I, evacuations took an average of 10.5 hours during World War II; the use of helicopters by American troops in Korea lowered this to 6.3 hours, and an average of 2.8 hours in Viet Nam. Transfer of Israeli wounded during the 1982 war in Lebanon took an average of 2.3 hours. The use of helicopters has radically changed evacuation and pre-hospital care for the armies of industrialized countries, but requires air superiority to be truly effective. It has also revolutionized equivalent civilian trauma systems. This resource is seldom available in a low-income country. EPIDEMIOLOGY"}
{"text": "\n## 5.8.2\n\n \n## Forward projection of resources\n\n Delayed evacuation may still result from operational contingencies, tactical situations, and difficult geography. Consequently, many armies have projected forward their surgical capacities close to zones of actual combat in an attempt to reach wounded soldiers earlier and avoid the mortality and morbidity related to any delay. The aim is primarily to reduce the number of “early” deaths. Soviet deployment of “Special Surgical Teams” in forward locations in Afghanistan shortened time to reach surgery: 31% of wounded were in surgery within 1 hour and another 39 % within 2 hours. Cumulatively, 92 % were in surgery within 6 hours with this system. This compares with an overall average during the war of 88% operated within 12 hours, before and after the establishment, of the forward teams. During fighting in Croatia in 1991, a Yugoslav mobile field hospital was located 5 – 10 km from the front: 61 % of wounded were evacuated within 30 minutes and another 22 % between 30 and 60 minutes of being injured. US troops in Afghanistan and Iraq have also seconded \"Forward Surgical Teams\" and “Forward Resuscitative Surgery Suites” to the field; surgical care routinely begins within 1 – 4 hours following injury. Preliminary reports give a mean time of one and a half hours for evacuation of USA military wounded in Iraq to a forward surgical facility."}
{"text": "\n## Urban warfare: hospitals on front lines 5.8.3\n\n During urban warfare, fighting can take place literally in front of surgical facilities; more than once has a patient been wounded at the front door of a hospital. This was the case during much of the fighting in Beirut in the Lebanese civil war, often with evacuation times of only minutes. A French medical team in Sarajevo in 1992 – 96 (UNPROFOR – IFOR), serving military and civilian casualties, had evacuation times of 15 – 45 minutes. Comparable times were encountered by ICRC hospital teams in Kabul in 1992 and Monrovia, Liberia, in 2003. ICRC and Somali Red Crescent surgical teams working in the Keysaney Hospital in North Mogadishu have witnessed similar short evacuation times from 1992 up until the present time of writing. Although the vast majority of wounded patients arrive at the hospital within minutes under these circumstances, a few suffer considerable delay. Without an organized pre-hospital system and given an absolute absence of ambulances, civilians are often cut off from care facilities during street fighting and have to wait hours or even days for evacuation."}
{"text": "\n## 5.8.4 The paradox of early treatment: changing mortality ratios and rates\n\n There is an apparent paradox of early evacuation and treatment: an increase in the absolute numbers who survive, but also an increase in the DOW and hospital mortality rates. Medics reach a number of former KIA in time; more severely injured casualties enter the evacuation chain earlier, but since natural automatic triage that weeds out the more severely injured does not come into play, a higher percentage of injured now die of their wounds after they have received care. For US armed forces who died in World War II and Viet Nam, 88% were KIA and 12% DOW. In the conflicts in Iraq and in Afghanistan, the figures are 77 % and 23 %.²³ 23    Holcomb JB, et al., 2006.

Obviously, the wearing of body armour and the inclusion in statistics of minor or superficial, non-penetrating wounds to the head or trunk will distort the anatomic distribution of wounds, and the ratio. In most wars, with evacuation counted in hours, the ratio is approximately 0.5. In urban areas and other situations of rapid evacuation, it tends towards 1. With increasing delay of evacuation to over 24 hours, and even days and weeks, the ratio falls.

{"text": "\n## 5.9.2\n\n \n## Hospital mortality versus post-operative mortality\n\n A number of considerations must be taken into account if one wishes to use hospital mortality as an indication of the efficiency of patient management systems. In armed conflict, surgeons often face mass casualties. Some patients will be triaged into the “expectant” category, and given supportive treatment only, to die without pain and with dignity (see Chapter 9). These patients are recorded as DOW and are often included in hospital mortality figures. Other patients die shortly after arrival, or \"on-table\", in an extreme attempt to save life. With a slightly longer evacuation time, many such patients would be KIA, dying before reaching hospital, as mentioned previously. Nonetheless, they are registered as DOW and are again included in hospital mortality figures. Then there are the truly post-operative deaths; some from irreversible shock, others from irretrievable brain injury and, others still, from surgical complications, mostly sepsis, and additional medical pathologies. Gross statistics of hospital mortality do not always take into consideration these very different categories of patients."}

Post-operative mortality in ICRC hospitals varies from 2.2% in Quetta and 3.1% in Peshawar to 4.2% in Kao-i-Dang, 4.8% in Kabul, and 6.1% in the Monrovia battle,  where evacuation times were extremely short.

{"text": "\n## 5.10.1   Surgical audit: methodology\n\n Without control over the pre-hospital phase and the known inadequacies of data collection, the mortality rate is not a credible statistic in ICRC surgical programmes and hospitals. The same is true of most public civilian structures. Far more substantial is the workload and morbidity as represented by the number of operations and blood transfusions per patient and the duration of hospitalization. For statistical purposes, most patients, if well managed, undergo two operations: wound excision and delayed primary closure. There are a number of factors that explain this: • the ICRC does not have a series of operative echelons of treatment as do the military; all operations are performed in the same hospital (see Chapters 1 and 6); • rarely do ICRC surgeons perform planned serial debridements of war wounds, requiring more operations (see Chapter 10); • some patients require a third operation for skin grafting to close the wound, or even more if a burn complicates a penetrating wound (see Chapter 11); • others call for a single operation: (craniotomy, chest tube drainage, or laparotomy); • some patients call for no operation, if they have been admitted solely for observation – expectant triage category, paraplegic, etc. (see Chapter 9); • small superficial wounds are often treated conservatively with dressings and antibiotics, with the exception of those caused by anti-personnel landmines (see Chapter 10). These \"normal\" single and multiple operations tend to balance each other out. (Pure burn injuries are not included in this discussion.)"}

{"text": "\n## 5.11 Conclusions: lessons to be gained from a study of epidemiology\n\n From this brief overview of the epidemiology of the victims of war, a few conclusions affecting clinical work and humanitarian action may be drawn.  For a civilian population in a poor country, the public health effects of war are usually greater than the effects of direct trauma. In some conflicts, war injuries carry a greater burden and post-traumatic morbidity may have more profound long-term effects than mortality. This is especially the case in a post-conflict situation with widespread contamination by anti-personnel mines whose socio- economic repercussions are long-lasting.  The outcome of war surgery in a civilian context is influenced by: • the severity of the injury; • the general condition of the patient (malnutrition, chronic disease, concomitant endemic disease such as malaria, etc.); • early and appropriate first aid; • the time needed for transport to the hospital; • the quality of hospital treatment (resuscitation, surgery, post-operative care, physiotherapy and rehabilitation); • possibility of evacuation to a better-equipped hospital with more experienced staff. 3. In a civilian context, and especially in a poor country, pre-hospital care is the phase most open to improvement. Much can be done to prevent death and morbidity with early and efficient first aid and life support. An efficient first-aid and evacuation system can prevent deaths from controllable haemorrhage and compromised airway. As pre-hospital care improves, the \"killed in action\" or \"dead on arrival\" may diminish slightly, only to see the \"dead of wounds\" and hospital mortality rise; more casualties are saved, but the rates become distorted. This bias should be taken into account when judging the adequacy of care. Long and difficult evacuation of the wounded results in an automatic \"natural triage\" of the most severely injured. Hospital mortality rates decrease as a result. Figure 5.8 Number of operations per patient according to wapon, simplified. WAR SURGERY 4. Up to 40 – 50% of the civilians wounded during urban fighting do not need hospitalization. First-aid measures – plus a simple oral antibiotic and analgesic – are all that are required. Their presence constitutes a supplementary burden on hospital management. However, discharging them from hospital can prove problematic because of security concerns, socio-economic factors and 5. Wounds to the head and torso are the most lethal. Injuries to the soft tissues and the limbs constitute the majority of surgical workload. 6. Gunshot wounds carry a heavier burden than injuries due to fragments; but burns and anti-personnel landmine injuries represent the heaviest hospital workload and morbidity. 7. The Red Cross Wound Score allows a good appreciation of the severity of war wounds, and the surgical workload that they represent."}

{"text": "\n## ANNEX 5. A\n\n \n## ICRC surgical database\n\n The ICRC set up a centralized wound database and trauma registry in 1990, originally designed to give the organization an indication of the surgical workload  of its independent hospitals (i.e. hospitals that were established and run under ICRC administration). All war-wounded patients admitted to ICRC hospitals have routinely had a data form filled out on their death or discharge. Patients are not asked whether Age and sex, the cause and anatomic site of injury, and the time lapsed between injury and admission are recorded for each patient. Projectile injuries are scored according to the Red Cross Wound Classification System described in Chapter 4. The emphasis is on surgical workload as described by severity of injuries, number of operations per patient, number of blood transfusions required, and length of hospitalization. These independent ICRC hospitals have served the victims of a number of armed conflicts of very different types of combat. As at 31 December 2007, the database contained the records of 32,285 war-wounded patients. Not all are complete, however. Hospital Period of activity Nature of combat Jungle guerrilla warfare in Kao-i-Dang Hospital, Thailand 1979-92 Cambodia Mountain guerrilla warfare in Peshawar Hospital, Pakistan 1981 - 93 Afghanistan Mountain guerrilla warfare in Quetta Hospital, Pakistan 1983 - 96 Afghanistan Karteh-Seh Hospital, Kabul, 1988-92 Irregular warfare, mostly urban Afghanistan Mirweis Hospital, Kandahar, 1996 – 2001 Irregular warfare, mostly urban Afghanistan Irregular guerrilla warfare, mostly Butare Hospital, Rwanda 1995 rural Novye Atagi Hospital, Chechnya, Irregular guerrilla warfare, rural 1996 Russian Federation and urban Rural querrilla war in semi¬ Lopiding Hospital, Lokichokio, 1987 – 2006 desert, sahel and reed swamps of Kenya southern Sudan  The above-mentioned conflicts were different in nature. Time to treatment often included extremes – minutes to weeks. Logistic difficulties over great distances meant that the ICRC could rarely organize efficient and timely evacuation of the victims. Notable exceptions were the first-aid posts set up near the Afghan border with Pakistan and close to Kabul. The air medical evacuation programme for southern Sudan, coordinated with the United Nations Operation Lifeline Sudan, saw over 20,000 patients transferred to the ICRC hospital in Lokichokio, northern Kenya, but the distances and delays in notification of patients nevertheless seldom allowed timely evacuation. WAR SURGERY The ICRC has also set up other hospitals, and its surgical teams have worked in local public hospitals, but their patients are not included in the database. In addition to the surgical database, other major sources of data include the Somali Red Crescent- run Keysaney Hospital in Mogadishu (1992 – present), and the JFK Memorial Hospital, Monrovia, Liberia (2001 – 2004), operated jointly by the ICRC and the hospital’s Board When studying ICRC statistics from the database, the limits of a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data taken exclusively from hospital admissions must be recognized. The usual problems have been observed: • clerical errors, • missing patient files, • incomplete patient files (not all categories were filled in for all patients), • confusion as to the definition of classification categories, • lack of continuity due to the constant turnover of hospital personnel, • lack of properly trained administrative support staff to maintain a database. Nonetheless, ICRC statistics are offered throughout this manual as an example of non- military experience in different combat zones as an approximation of the reality of the battlefield, especially for non-combatant populations.

{"text": "\n## The links: what kind of care, and where?\n\n Modern armed conflict embraces classical war between conventional armies, urban combat between militias, and isolated and sporadic but fierce guerrilla attacks in remote rural areas. It may involve mass conflict or chronic irregular, low-intensity combat, or individual terrorist attacks. Civilians often represent the majority of victims (see Chapter 5). Field situations vary considerably, but basic medical problems for the wounded are universal. A system must be developed and adapted to deliver the best possible care in a timely manner, under all circumstances.  Modern armed conflict takes place in rural areas and cities. Civilian populations are increasingly at risk. Landmines and unexploded cluster munitions continue to cause victims after the conflict has ended.  Field situations vary; medical needs are universal. The system of evacuation and treatment of the sick and wounded – the chain of casualty care – like any chain, is as strong as its weakest link. It is measured not in kilometres but in hours and days. The setting up of such a system requires planning ahead of time: an assessment of the tactical circumstances must be made; an analysis of the physical limitations and human resources carried out; and the resulting plan implemented. Wounded patients are transferred along a chain of medical care, beginning with simple \"life- and limb-saving\" procedures and continuing to ever-greater levels of sophistication. The principle of echelons of care in a military system has been described in Chapter 1. In civilian practice patients also tend to follow a chain of evacuation and treatment although, in many countries, this is not very efficient."}

The protective quality of these emblems is a function of the training and degree of discipline of the combatant forces, and their adherence to internationally accepted norms of behaviour on the battlefield: the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols. This protection begins with the first aider in the field and continues through all the levels of treatment. Special measures must be taken to prevent further injury to any casualties and to protect them from the elements (see Chapter 7). WAR SURGERY"}
{"text": "\n## 6.1.2 Levels and locations of medical care\n\n The following list defines the generic places where the wounded receive different levels of medical care in the multiple-phase treatment of war wounds. 1. On the spot: first aid. 2. Collection point: first aid with/without resuscitation. 4. Surgical hospital: primary surgical treatment. Specialized centre: definitive surgical treatment including reconstructive 5. procedures; physiotherapy and rehabilitation, both physical and psychological. 6. Transport system for transfer from one echelon to another. Treatment on the spot may be self- or \"buddy\"-treatment, or practised by a military medic or first aider. First aid starts at the point of wounding, but can be given anywhere and everywhere along the evacuation line to the place of definitive treatment. First aid is the only possible treatment on the battlefield. The setting up of a collection point or clearing station may be a spontaneous response; alternatively, an established first-aid post (FAP), dispensary, or primary health centre might serve this purpose. Some FAP will be staffed by military stretcher- bearers and medics, others by Red Cross/Red Crescent volunteers, or other civilian personnel. The closer to the battlefield, the more prominent will be the role of military medical services. In purely civilian rural settings, village health workers, nurses or medical assistants are often the only health professionals available. Collecting the wounded at one specific location allows for the proper organization of field triage and their efficient evacuation. Besides basic first aid and trauma life support, resuscitative measures may be begun here. A health centre or rural hospital might represent the intermediate stage, where more sophisticated resuscitation and emergency surgery are available. The military might establish a forward surgical unit. Figure 6.1 Figure 6.2 Figure 6.3 National Society first aiders in the field. First-aid post on the Afghan-Pakistani border.

Three basic levels can be described."}
{"text": "\n## 6.2.1\n\n \n## Hospital A: rural hospital = basic trauma services\n\n A district hospital (Africa) or primary health centre (South Asia) without full-time specialist doctors, especially without a fully-trained general surgeon, is a typical example. These hospitals are usually staffed by general practitioners or medical assistants with some surgical training and equipped with a minimum of proper surgical facilities. Front-line hospitals with \"field surgeons\" ¹ exist in some military medical services and are the equivalent. Basic resuscitation and some simple but critical operations are usually performed here."}
{"text": "\n## 6.2.2\n\n \n## Hospital B: provincial hospital = advanced trauma services\n\n A regional hospital (Africa), district hospital (South Asia), or general hospital (Latin America) have a full-time general surgeon and proper operating theatre and sterilization facilities.

{"text": "\n## 6.2.4\n\n \n##  Hospital assessment\n\n ICRC programmes aim to maintain, and upgrade if possible, the competencies of these different levels of hospital care when necessary. The ICRC has developed an analytical tool for assessing the quality of hospital management and surgical work prior to providing assistance. This tool comprises a number of factors to be considered. There are factors external to the hospital, involving an analysis of the national and provincial health systems, and internal factors: hospital infrastructure, administration and functional organization, departments, available resources, medical personnel (number and expertise), non-medical support services, finances (see Annex 6. A: Initial assessment of a surgical hospital treating the war-wounded). ICRC field hospital, Lokichokio, Kenya.

The pie-charts above show the various factors that affect the functioning of a hospital dealing with the added burden of war-wounded patients compounded by the constraints of a weakened health system, and help identify dysfunctional areas.

{"text": "\n## 6.3.1\n\n \n## Command, control and communications: coordination\n\n A chain of command is necessary to make the various echelons function correctly. A central command or dispatch centre will assume overall coordination (e.g. decisions about transfer/evacuation destinations, engagement of resources, etc.), and be responsible for contacts with related command levels of various authorities (e.g. armed forces, police, headquarters of the National Red Cross/Red Crescent Society, civil defence and national rescue service, etc.). Circulation of information between the different levels is assured by some means of telecommunication – radio and mobile phones – if possible, or by other means (e.g. foot messengers) if not. Mobile telephone systems have a tendency to stop functioning – be turned off – during crises and armed conflict. The efficiency of the command and communication systems depends on strict observance of established procedures. THE CHAIN OF CASUALTY CARE"}
{"text": "\n## 6.4 Forward projection of resources\n\n Bringing more than basic first aid closer to the collection point is called \"forward projection of resources\". The availability of advanced procedures closer to the battlefield has many advantages. It allows quicker access to \"life- and limb-saving\" emergency measures, thus decreasing both mortality and morbidity. The need for potentially dangerous transport is reduced. The projection of resources applies particularly to treatment at the intermediate stage, but can be applied to any echelon in the chain. Forward projection of resources allows quicker access to life- and limb-saving measures. However, certain conditions must be met. A number of factors limit the possibility to project resources. 1. 2. Human resources and expertise (essential). Equipment (appropriate technology). 3. Supplies (appropriate). 4. Infrastructure (minimum requirements). 5. Possibility of onward evacuation. 6. When a front-line hospital is coming under bombardment, putting both patients and personnel at risk, there is little point in attempting more than first aid if evacuation to another facility is possible. On the other hand, a forward collection point may provide advanced treatment. Only a minimum of equipment is necessary for well-trained medics to perform endotracheal intubation or place a chest tube, and then quickly evacuate the patient. A secure building with adequate resources may be used as an intermediate stage where a forward surgical team may perform damage control and resuscitative surgical procedures. All of these possibilities will depend on meeting the criteria defined above; but especially on security and human expertise. Infrastructure, equipment and supplies must all meet minimum requirements, and be appropriate to the task under the prevailing conditions. The most important factors determining the forward projection of medical care for the war-wounded are security and human expertise. The appropriate choice of procedures to undertake for the injured outside a formal hospital setting will depend on the factors mentioned above, and will vary from country to country, and even from region to region within the same country. The organization of any chain of casualty care for the war-wounded – military or civilian – should rely on a large dose of common sense to determine what is practical and what can realistically be accomplished to assure the best results for the greatest number, while at the same time guaranteeing the safety of the injured and the health workers. What exactly can be done for the injured outside a formal hospital setting will depend on the particular circumstances and means available. There is no dogma to be followed blindly; situations are different and improvisation and adaptation the ky to success. WAR SURGERY On the spot Collection point Intermediate stage Who?

As mentioned in Chapter 1, there is more than one \"surgery\" for the care of the war- wounded. The exact number of levels of care and the path followed by casualties are determined on a case-by-case basis according to the sophistication of care and logistics available. In some armies or countries, the organization may be so efficient that a wounded soldier may expect to receive treatment virtually as sophisticated as the care available to him in peacetime. In developing countries, however, the healthcare system might already be weak before the conflict and may almost cease to function because of it. Water and electricity supplies can be unreliable, trained staff often flee the area, drugs and disposable equipment cannot be replaced, budgets and salaries are not paid, and Every combination of levels of care is possible: • the wounded from a modern industrialized army are transferred by helicopter from the scene of injury directly to a surgical hospital; • patients in low-income countries reach health facilities on foot or by oxcart, donkey, private motor vehicle, taxi or lorry; • during urban warfare, family and neighbours transport a casualty directly to the emergency room of a surgical hospital, which then serves as a collection point; • in the rural areas of a low-income country, the hospital is the only health structure functioning and serves as all levels in one – forward referral of patients to a more sophisticated level of care is not available; • rural health centres may flourish while surgical hospitals may exist only in large cities; • a collection point or intermediate stage in a secure building is upgraded with the necessary equipment and personnel to serve as a forward surgical hospital, with or without possibility of forward referral. In some contexts, the ICRC has resorted to deploying a Field Surgical Team that is not hospital based. This mobile team \"goes to the wounded\" rather than having the  wounded come to a hospital; the chain of casualty care is turned upside-down. This In armed conflicts, under international humanitarian law, civilians are permitted to collect and care for the wounded and sick of whatever nationality, and shall not be penalized for doing so. On the contrary, they must be aided in this work. Furthermore, IHL prescribes that the civilian population shall respect the wounded and sick, even if they belong to the enemy, and shall commit no act of violence against them. THE CHAIN OF CASUALTY CARE has been necessary where casualties have not had access to medical care for reasons  of personal security (Figures 1.4 and 6.8). Techniques will also differ according to context. For the military, there is a balance between the needs of the wounded soldier and the necessities of combat. Some armed forces may teach the use of the self-applied tourniquet, which purportedly allows a wounded soldier to continue shooting. This logic does not apply to civilian institutions, and the ICRC's first-aid manual 3 proscribes the use of a tourniquet in the field except in very rare circumstances."}

The best possible outcome for wounded people can only be achieved with proper planning and training. Plans must be realistic, flexible and reviewed regularly. Should a country be caught unawares at the outbreak of hostilities without having a pre-prepared plan, then the planning process must be accelerated and the necessary analysis take place immediately. All plans begin with a strategic assessment of the possible conflict scenarios. What may happen and where? What needs are foreseen? What resources exist? (see Annex 6. B: Strategic assessment of a conflict scenario). An analysis of the assessment will then answer the questions of what should be done,  where, and by whom to improve the care for the wounded. The reality check asks a few basic questions. Are the recommendations compatible with the context? Are they relevant? Practical? Reality checks are important; they influence planning, care, and training, and make certain that academic theory does not override simple pragmatism. The organization of a chain of casualty care and in particular the assignment of resources (physical and human) to the different echelons must take into consideration a number of factors: • the nature of the conflict, the tactical and geographic circumstances, and security concerns; • the size of the casualty load; • the quality of the casualty load, i.e. the types of injuries; • the relative and proportionate number of human resources (surgical capacity depends on the number of teams working and the rate of arrival of casualties); • the quality of human resources, i.e. expertise; • logistics and supplies; The ICRC Field Surgical Team in Darfur.

{"text": "\n## 6.7 The pyramid of ICRC surgical programmes\n\n ICRC delegates are often called upon to help organize a chain of casualty care. At times this will be in support of existing governmental or non-governmental structures. On occasion, the ICRC is required or asked to establish its own independently-run hospitals. The main reasons for doing so are either a question of protection – of the patients or the medical mission – or because of a dire shortage of local human resources. Unlike a military field hospital, an independent ICRC hospital is often responsible for all levels of medical care. It acts as a first-aid post, field hospital, base hospital, and referral centre. In this, an ICRC hospital resembles many provincial hospitals in non-industrialized countries ravaged by war. The level of care is a combination of advanced and comprehensive trauma services. Only general surgeons are present,  and no further referral of patients to a specialized centre is possible."}
{"text": "\n## An independent ICRC hospital comprises all echelons in one structure.\n\n In both instances – support to national structures or establishment of an ICRC hospital – a number of factors are taken into consideration to ensure the neutrality and independence of ICRC activities on the one hand, and the quality and professionalism of care on the other.

{"text": "\n## First aid: its crucial importance 7.1\n\n Optimal management of the injured involves a continuum of care from the point of wounding to the surgical hospital: the chain of casualty care. The surgeon wishes to receive patients who arrive in good condition and well-stabilized, in a timely manner, and according to priority for treatment. To understand how this is achieved, or not, there are a number of things that need to be known about first aid. In addition, the surgeon working in a conflict area may well be called upon to participate in the training of first aiders to achieve a more efficient chain of casualty care. First aid is the initial assistance given to an injured or sick person until the condition  of the person is stabilized or remedied, or professional medical help is made available. How first aid is applied varies according to the security environment, the number and condition of the wounded in a particular location, the resources that can be mobilized for care, transport, and access to surgical hospitals and the latter's capacity to receive Since its foundation, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has been, and continues to be, predominantly associated with the provision of first aid. It pioneered the concept of immediate response by first aiders and local communities  to the consequences of war, disasters and epidemics. The goals of a first aider in action are: • to preserve life through the support of vital functions; • to intervene securely and safely; • to limit the effect of injury and to prevent further injury; • to prevent complications and disability; • to alleviate suffering and to provide psychological/moral support; • to promote recovery; • to ensure proper handover of the injured and sick to healthcare professionals when needed. First aiders can also help mobilize their community to prepare for and respond to emergencies that happen in everyday life and during crises such as armed conflict. Experience has shown that one of the most important factors determining the outcome of the management of the war-wounded is the pre-hospital phase. First aid saves lives and decreases morbidity. It also results in easier surgery, thus decreasing the hospital surgical burden. Furthermore, up to 40 – 60 % of the civilians and soldiers wounded during armed conflict do not require hospitalization. First aid measures – plus a simple oral antibiotic and analgesic – constitute all the treatment they need. Military terminology calls them “returned to duty” (see Chapter 5)."}
{"text": "\n##  First aid, begun early, saves lives and can prevent many complications and much disability.\n\n The provision of first aid is one of the fundamental responsibilities of military medical services, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and, increasingly in contemporary armed conflict, of medical staff in both urban and rural public hospitals. The essential role of local communities in providing assistance on the spot should not be forgotten, as Henry Dunant, founder of the Red Cross and inspiration behind the Geneva Conventions, witnessed after the battle of Solferino on 24 June 1859.¹ 1 See Henry Dunant. A Memory of Solferino. ICRC: Geneva; 1986. WAR SURGERY Consequently, basic first aid, initial and refresher training, should be supported among: • the general population; • soldiers and members of security forces; • community healthcare workers; • military and other medical staff (nurses, doctors and surgeons). Commanders do not appreciate seeing their troop levels decrease when healthy uninjured soldiers are involved in transferring their own wounded because first-aid services are inadequate in the field. The fighting capacity is then doubly reduced. Advanced competencies can be added to the training curriculum of those specially dedicated to providing first-aid services in the field, such as military medics and the first-aid teams of the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, as a forward projection of resources."}
{"text": "\n## First aid in the chain of casualty care 7.2\n\n First aid starts at the point of wounding, but can be given anywhere and everywhere along the chain of casualty care to the place of definitive treatment. On-the-spot first aid, often performed on the actual battlefield, may be self- or buddy- first aid if combatants have received the proper training prior to deployment. Otherwise, it is practised by a military medic, civilian or Red Cross/Red Crescent first aider. It is common practice and convenient to bring all the wounded to one spot, depending on the tactical situation, to evaluate their condition, start first aid if it has not yet been given, and stabilize those for whom lifesaving measures have already been undertaken; and then to decide who needs to be evacuated for further treatment according to triage priorities. This is best served by a first-aid post (FAP)."}

{"text": "\n## First aiders: an important human resource\n\n Usually first aiders are organized in teams with proper supervision and equipment, such as those of the Red Cross or Red Crescent or of the military.

They take on many roles from the front lines to the healthcare facility; their Therefore, it is important to respect their knowledge, and appreciate their courage and dedication. They have important rights and duties according to international humanitarian law, and should be trained accordingly. They should also be trained in the methods and practice of triage. Not only is it important to welcome them when they bring in a casualty but also to give them feedback on the measures they have taken and on the evolution of the casualties they have already brought in, to ensure a proper handover of the patient and prepare for future work. The surgeon plays a vital role in this communication with first aiders."}

{"text": "\n## 7.4.1\n\n \n## Security first and always\n\n One of the specific characteristics of armed conflict, as mentioned, is the particularly hazardous situations encountered, more dangerous than during natural catastrophes or industrial accidents. The situation is made even worse because of the will of combatants to continue fighting and inflict harm after the initial damage has been done, and the increasing unwillingness of many combatants to recognize and obey the rules of armed conflict. First aiders are exposed and at great risk, or are at times even targeted in an ambush or a gun battle. All too often, when a bomb explodes or is dropped there is a rush of first-aid rescuers to the site; a second bomb goes off a short time later causing far more casualties than the first. Furthermore, the work space may be limited by an excited and angry crowd of bystanders and the casualties’ friends, relatives and"}
{"text": "\n## The point of wounding is, by definition, a very dangerous and chaotic place.\n\n This entails practical consequences for the first aider and imposes necessary constraints for the safety of patient and first aider alike. A wounded first aider needs help and cannot help others. The question of first-aid care under fire – for military personnel – will depend on the doctrine and training of each army. As previously stated, the sick and wounded benefit from protection and the first aider has rights and responsibilities according to international humanitarian law.

The challenge is how to deploy and organize the necessary first-aid personnel, material, and equipment in the field. For the military, this is also a challenge but has a different connotation.

The prevention of further injury thus involves removing casualties from the point of wounding, and putting patients and medical personnel in as safe a place as circumstances allow. Furthermore, conscious and walking wounded must be separated from the others as a matter of scene security management, as well as triage. Preventing aggravation of the injury: sheltering the casualties Shelter offers some protection from further injury in a combat environment, and also provides a shield from the elements. Exposure to the sun and heat, or cold and rain, are deleterious to the wellbeing and stabilization of the injured. It is also easier and more efficient to deliver medical care when working under more comfortable physical conditions."}

Casualties should be covered with a simple sheet or blanket, depending on the prevailing climate, without forgetting to put something under the patient since much body heat is dissipated into the ground.

Over a period of 10 days, 6 nurses and 3 Red Cross volunteers treated 244 war casualties and 228 sick patients, while a surgical team from Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) operated in the general hospital. Urban fighting often made it dangerous for patients to reach the hospital and they regularly stayed in the improvised FAP for 2 or 3 days prior to evacuation. In addition to basic first-aid treatment, intravenous fluid resuscitation, tetanus immunoglobulin, penicillin, and analgesia were given. Many patients survived 2 - 4 days, before being transferred to the hospital, and surgery. The MSF surgical team appreciated receiving patients who had dressed wounds and were \"well  hydrated\", ready for surgery. Security, however, was a major concern. Looting of the ICRC delegation by armed men occurred twice and several of the 4,500 civilians, who had taken refuge in the delegation premises, effectively turning it into a displaced persons camp,  were injured or killed by stray bullets.

A strategy for the efficient care and evacuation of the wounded must be established. Two well-known strategies are described by the expressions \"scoop-and-run\" and \"stay-and-treat\". These derive largely from the civilian practice of emergency medical services in industrialized countries and may not be particularly relevant in a context of armed conflict. In a peacetime environment, there is no impediment to patient transfer other than infrastructure and geography. The efficiency of evacuation is determined by the availability and coordination of transport, either by air (fixed wing with WAR SURGERY airports or helicopters and helipads), or by land (proper roads, necessary vehicles, etc.); and the distances involved. The context of armed conflict is not as simple. Scoop-and-run implies basic life-saving first-aid measures, then taking the patient immediately to a surgical hospital. This is appropriate if the distances are short, reliable transport is available, and the nearby hospital is adequately supplied and staffed. Keeping patients on the spot until patient stabilization prior to evacuation – stay and treat – is correct if distances are great, infrastructure and transport are less than adequate, and proper surgical facilities are more difficult to access. In a military context, the factors of ongoing combat and enemy activity must be added to those present during peacetime. Here, scoop-and-run implies air superiority if helicopters are used, safe and controlled roads for transport over land, and, in both situations, surgical facilities at a reasonable distance. These conditions are fulfilled for only a few armies in the world, and even then only under certain tactical situations. More common is the establishment of a collection point or clearing station: that is to say “stay-and-treat”. How much “treatment” occurs depends on the forward projection of resources. The performance of more advanced techniques in the field has been discussed in Chapter 6."}
{"text": "\n## 7.7.2\n\n \n## Mechanism of injury and the problem of the cervical spine\n\n The first aider, or other medical personnel, must immediately determine whether the casualty has suffered blunt or penetrating trauma. Blunt trauma above the level of the clavicles or causing unconsciousness requires immediate observation and immobilization of the cervical spine, while still giving priority to the airway. A penetrating wound to the brain causing unconsciousness requires no special care of the cervical spine. In the case of a penetrating missile wound to the neck hitting the cervical vertebrae, any damage to the spinal cord has already been done. Unstable cervical spine injury from a projectile results in permanent cord injury. The reported mortality is over 95 %. The first aider should be careful while handling the casualty, but cannot prevent damage that is already irreversible. A combination of blunt and penetrating neck injuries should be managed in the same way as blunt ones."}
{"text": "\n##  ICRC EXPERIENCE\n\n Here are two practical examples taken from ICRC experience to demonstrate the difference between blunt and penetrating trauma: A person wounded in a road-traffic crash with a fractured mandible and bleeding from the mouth that obstructs the airway also requires care of the cervical spine in case there is hidden injury. A bullet wound to the mandible – with bone fragments, haematoma, drooling saliva, and damaged soft tissue of the floor of the mouth – does not. If the patient is conscious, he will maintain a particular position – head thrust forward and looking down, blood and saliva flowing out – in order to maintain as patent an airway as possible. There is no use in placing a protective cervical collar on this patient and, if the first aider attempts to place the casualty in a reclining position, the wounded person will resist. A fall may result in both loss of consciousness and injury to the cervical spine.

Various studies show that far more soldiers die from catastrophic peripheral haemorrhage than from airway obstruction or respiratory inadequacy. Thus, the \"C\" which stands for Catastrophic bleeding, may be put first, simply because it is more common. Once catastrophic external haemorrhage, which is quite obvious, has been excluded – the great majority of cases – the first aider should resort immediately to the standard routine of ABCDE."}
{"text": "\n## 7.7.4 The tourniquet: when and how?\n\n The tourniquet is said to save lives, but endanger limbs. It is difficult to apply correctly and to maintain and supervise, and open to many complications if widely used when not necessary. Furthermore, the prolonged application of an improvised tourniquet is usually not effective and causes tissue damage by itself (Figures 7.3.1 and 7.3.2). There is little or no use for a tourniquet in civilian practice for the war-wounded. It may be applied as a last resort, when all else has failed, to temporarily control bleeding while packing the wound and applying a compressive bandage. It should then be removed. Figure 7.3.1 Figure 7.3.2 Improvised tourniquet: how harmful? Here a tourniquet was applied for Improvised tourniquet: how effective? more than six hours, resulting in a very high above the knee amputation. Improvised tourniquet: how harmful? Here a tourniquet was applied for more than six hours, resulting in a very high above the knee amputation. By far the most common and most effective technique for a first aider to control peripheral haemorrhage is direct pressure over the wound completed by a compressive bandage; or, if insufficient, pressure over the proximal artery in the axilla or groin, tamponade of the wound with dressings, and then a compressive bandage. The military might continue to use a tourniquet under certain tactical circumstances: to free the hands of the single medic when dealing with mass casualties; while performing first aid under direct fire, and especially at night. Some armies equip their soldiers with a pre-manufactured self-applicable tourniquet applied with one hand to allow a wounded soldier to continue participating in combat. The ICRC declines to pronounce on these tactical considerations, but warns against an all too easy abuse  of the tourniquet as has been seen in many wars in the past. The use of a tourniquet for crush injuries (people trapped under the rubble of a collapsed building whether due to an earthquake or bombardment) is justifiable, and due precautions should be taken to ensure rehydration/resuscitation and thereby avoid the complications of the otherwise inevitable myoglobinaemia.  For further information on crush injury, see Volume 2. New locally-active haemostatic powders and sponges to promote clotting in traumatic wounds are being tested by some armies; however direct pressure must still be applied. The ICRC has no experience with these and, like most others, eagerly awaits the published results of these field trials. Cost and availability will be factors to be taken into consideration for their use worldwide. Peripheral haemorrhage can be controlled by external pressure and a compressive bandage. WAR SURGERY"}
{"text": "\n## 7.7.5 Resuscitation or rehydration?\n\n The first aider can only implement simple procedures in the field. The administration of intravenous fluids requires a certain degree of medical knowledge and specific equipment that are beyond the normal scope and competencies of a first aider. He can be involved in the monitoring of a perfusion, however. The subject of pre-hospital i.v. fluids has given rise to considerable controversy. Maintaining adequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation is balanced off against the dilution of clotting factors and the dislodging of existing clots when the blood pressure goes up (\"popping the clot\"). The currently recommended \"hypotensive resuscitation\" involves giving fluids to a just palpable radial pulse – equivalent to a systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg – and no more (see Chapter 8). A great deal of this controversy concerns efficient civilian trauma systems where evacuation times are short, less than 2 hours. It is probable that only the war-wounded showing obvious clinical signs of shock require pre-hospital i.v. fluids. In addition, in many contemporary conflicts transfer to a hospital takes much longer – days or even weeks – where “popping the clot” is not really relevant. Rehydration – as part of resuscitation – may be a more appropriate term under these circumstances. If the wounded patient is conscious and not suffering from head trauma, the first aider can rehydrate with oral fluids (e.g. oral rehydration salts), especially if evacuation is delayed and transport long. This procedure is probably not employed nearly enough. Oral rehydration can probably be given with no detriment to the patient even in cases of abdominal trauma, and especially for severe burns."}

It easily translates into the Glasgow system when the patient arrives at the hospital and gives the surgeon a good appreciation of the evolution of the patient’s condition.

Palpation of every vertebra – like \"fingers playing on piano keys\" – aims to identify any induration or deformity. If there is any danger to the spinal cord, then the four-person log-roll technique should be used to move the patient onto a stretcher. The cervical spine can be immobilized initially by manually controlling the head before a neck collar/ Minerva splint is placed. Immobilization of the cervical spine must not increase the risk of airway obstruction, however. The importance of the mechanism of injury, blunt or penetrating, has already been mentioned. In all cases of suspected injury to the vertebral column, proper handling of the patient and immobilization techniques are of the utmost importance; the injury may already be there, but the first aider should act in such a way that he does not worsen the condition."}
{"text": "\n## 7.7.8 Evacuation: a risk to take\n\n Transportation of the wounded is always difficult, always takes longer than expected, adds to the trauma, and can be dangerous to the patient and those transporting the casualty: the famous \"mortality of the ambulance ride\". In situations of armed conflict, the danger of the ambulance ride is complicated by the risks of ongoing combat. Figures 7.5.1 and 7.5.2 Different means of patient evacuation: modern WAR SURGERY Speed is less important than safety of transport: ambulance crashes are notorious. All these parameters, aggravation of the patient's condition, use of resources and security, must be weighed against the likely benefits of moving the wounded. In an urban environment, it is normal for a first aider to bypass the neighbourhood clinic if the injury is serious, and to evacuate to a clinic for a minor wound in order not to overburden the hospitals. Unfortunately, city-dwellers often spontaneously rush patients to hospital no matter how slight the injury. Evacuation and transport may be difficult and dangerous during urban fighting even if distances are very short and transfer may be delayed while waiting for a calm period or ceasefire. There is also the confusion that reigns during street fighting and the highly-charged emotional atmosphere to contend with. Lack of discipline to perform good pre- hospital triage – and the “pressure” of bystanders – can result in chaos in the receiving hospital. The first wave of ambulances transports the dead and badly mutilated. The second wave of ambulances carries people who are shouting, hysterical, and frightened: the lucid and superficially injured. The third wave evacuates the seriously wounded who truly require emergency treatment; these patients lie still – they are usually haemorrhaging – without shouting to bring attention to themselves. In remote rural areas, if transportation takes many hours or even days, it is logical to project forward competencies by training local providers in more advanced skills. The principles of triage apply to the choice of which patients to evacuate first (see Chapter 9). Note that there is an important difference in the priority to treat and the priority to evacuate, especially if evacuation is prolonged. The recognition of injuries that are not survivable helps to spare the victim and would-be rescuers the agony and frustration of unsuccessful efforts to reach a higher level of care, and to provide better care for those who can survive. Delay in evacuation will contribute to an increase in pre-hospital mortality; the more severely injured suffer \"nature's triage\". As was seen in Chapter 5, longer and more difficult evacuation sorts out central injuries, with a consequent decline in hospital mortality: only those patients with a good chance of survival reach the hospital. This remains a major problem in the care of the war-wounded. 7 167 Chapter 8 HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM CARE 8 WAR SURGERY HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM CARE 8. 8.1 ACDE priorities 171 8.2 Initial examination 171 8.3 Airway 172 8.3.1 Opening the airway 173 8.3.2 Definitive patent airway 173 Definitive patent airway: endotracheal intubation 8.3.3 173 8.3.4 Definitive patent airway: surgical airway 174 8.4 Breathing and ventilation 175 8.4.1 Assisted ventilation 176 8.5 Circulation 177 8.5.1 Pericardial tamponade and pericardiocentesis 177 8.5.2 Haemorrhagic shock 178 8.5.3 Fluid replacement 179 181 8.5.4 Hypotensive resuscitation Adjuvant therapy 8.5.5 181 Blood transfusion where supplies are limited 8.6 181 8.6.1 Clinical use of blood in ICRC practice 182 Two unit rule 8.6.2 182 8.6.3 Fresh whole blood 183 8.6.4 A Autotransfusion 183 Total blood requirements: the ICRC’s experience 8.6.5 183 8.7 Disability 184 Environment/exposure 8.8 185 8.8.1 “Fatal triad” of coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia 185 8.9 Complete examination 185 Complementary diagnostic examinations and monitoring 8.9.1 187 HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM CARE"}

{"text": "\n## Please note:\n\n In certain countries a very definite separation must be made for emergency examination and treatment of male and female patients. This can be problematic in a mass casualty situation; nonetheless, the emergency department must be organized accordingly."}
{"text": "\n## 8.2 Initial examination\n\n The initial examination and emergency resuscitation are carried out simultaneously. 1. Is the patient dead or alive? 2. Is the casualty conscious or not? What is the mechanism of injury: penetrating or blunt? 3. 4. What are the life-threatening conditions, if any, according to the ABCDE algorithm? The natural reflex when faced with a wounded person is to look at the bleeding first. It must be understood that the greatest threat to life is an inadequate intake of air. Airway takes precedence over breathing and over circulation. With practice, the airway and breathing can be secured quickly enough to then allow the doctor to deal with any visible haemorrhage. (The situation in a hospital emergency room is different from one of “catastrophic haemorrhage” in the field, as discussed in Chapter 7 on first aid.) The ER doctor must learn to use the ABCDE scheme of thinking in a circular fashion. Determining if the patient is dead or alive already involves a rapid ABCDE WAR SURGERY examination. The dead have no air intake (A), no ventilation of the lungs (B), and no pulse (C); the pupils are dilated and do not react to light and there is no reaction to painful stimulus (D); there is no movement of the limbs and the body feels cold (E). When mastered, the ABCDE scheme of thinking allows the doctor to answer all the above questions in one integrated process. Most casualties are conscious, anxious or frightened, and in pain, and will tell you what happened and where “it hurts”: they are alive, conscious, and the act of speaking shows that the airway is free. These signs of life may seem obvious. Nonetheless, one should make a mental checklist and practice the routine of asking the series of initial questions in order to establish an organized and coherent method of examination. As mentioned in the previous chapter on first aid, blunt trauma above the level of the clavicles requires adequate care of the cervical spine, but not at the expense of a life-threatening airway problem. Simple measures include: manual stabilization in a neutral position with the head maintained in the axial line; semi-rigid collar; sandbags; taping; specialized backboard. The initial examination should include the diagnosis of any life-threatening A, B, or C problems and the number, location and extent of obvious wounds. These two elements together are important for establishing triage priorities (see Chapter 9). A more complete examination to locate all wounds should follow the initial ABCDE examination. It is important to determine the time since injury, estimate blood loss since injury, and the presence or absence of any allergies. In civilian casualties, past or pre-existing diseases and medications for chronic conditions should be taken into account. Young healthy combatants usually do not present such medical problems. In a hospital environment the casualty should be completely undressed to allow for a correct examination – again, certain cultural or religious constraints may apply. Vital signs should be taken, i.v. lines placed and blood samples withdrawn simultaneously for blood grouping and cross-matching, and a haematocrit or haemoglobin estimation to determine a baseline for future comparison. Other tests, such as electrolytes, blood gases, glucose, etc. may be performed depending on local standards and laboratory capacity."}
{"text": "\n## 8.3\n\n \n## Airway\n\n Airway obstruction is an emergency that requires an immediate response. Some injuries cause an immediate problem; others may result in delayed impairment of the airway. The following list presents the common conditions that cause airway problems. Head injury with decreased consciousness: Apart from the danger of aspiration of vomitus, blood, broken teeth, bone fragments or foreign bodies, the tongue and epiglottis may fall back and block the airway. Furthermore, Maxillo-facial injuries: Even if the patient can breathe adequately in the beginning, the development of oedema of the tongue, floor of the mouth and pharynx will obstruct air intake after several hours. Penetrating wounds to the larynx or upper trachea: If large enough, they will create a “traumatic tracheotomy”. Blunt injury to the larynx (by a rifle butt): Compressive haematoma in the neck: This may accumulate slowly compressing the hypopharynx or larynx from the outside. Burns to the face and neck or inhalation burns of the larynx and trachea: Whether due to ordinary fire and smoke or specific irritating chemical agents, these require close observation for delayed obstruction or respiratory failure due to oedema.

{"text": "\n## 8.3.1  Opening the airway\n\n As in first aid, the standard treatment for an actual or potential obstruction applies.  Basic steps for securing the airway 1. Open the mouth. 2.

To open and clean the mouth the standard manoeuvres are jaw thrust or chin lift: displace the tongue forward, and then finger-sweep the mouth while protecting the finger, aided by a suction apparatus if available. These techniques will cause some movement in the cervical spine. Manual in-line axial stabilization of the head during the manoeuvres will reduce such movement. Patency of the airway, nonetheless, takes precedence. To maintain the airway patent a number of devices can be used: • oropharyngeal airway (Guedel tube); • nasopharyngeal airway; • laryngeal mask airway; • combitube (double lumen tube inserted blindly into the trachea and oesophagus). All of these methods keep the airway open but cannot ensure protection against vomiting and aspiration of gastric contents. During the reception of mass casualties, the overwhelmed ER personnel may have to revert to a simpler method as a temporary procedure. Under these conditions , the lateral recovery position (lateral security, post-tonsillectomy or semi-prone position) will be the position of choice for most patients with an airway at risk until more secure procedures can be achieved.

{"text": "\n## Tension pneumothorax\n\n The diagnosis of a tension pneumothorax can be difficult on purely clinical grounds, except in the case of obvious respiratory distress; in this case no time should be wasted taking an X-ray (Figure 8.2). The condition requires an immediate wide-bore i.v. cannula to be inserted into the second or third intercostal space in the midclavicular line (needle thoracocentesis) attached to an improvised Heimlich one-way flutter valve as a temporary measure (Figure 8.3). A positive finding is indicated by the sudden rush of air as the needle enters the pleural cavity. The cannula should be long enough (8 cm) to fully penetrate the muscles of the chest wall (average thickness 4 – 6 cm). An intercostal chest tube (midclavicular or 5th intercostal space at the midaxillary line) should replace the needle thoracocentesis as soon as possible. Tension pneumo- thorax with respiratory distress: the only thing wrong with the X-ray film is that it was taken. The diagnosis should have been a clinical one. Figure 8.3 cannula is inserted at the upper edge of a rib. A finger from a surgical glove, with a 1 cm-long incision in the end, is tied around the cannula. Needle thoracocentesis may fail, however, even in the presence of a tension pneumothorax. A negative trial should not necessarily rule out its existence. A simple finger thoracostomy in the 5th intercostal space at the midaxillary line is a good alternative. A positive result, again, is indicated by the hiss of air rushing out; a chest tube is placed immediately. WAR SURGERY Figure 8.4.1 Simple, but massive, pneumothorax.

Common pathologies requiring such assistance include: • head injury; • large flail segment; • blast injury of lungs; • inhalation of toxic gases or smoke or flash burn to the tracheo-bronchial tree; • aspiration pneumonitis; and • other medical causes of respiratory insufficiency. Assisted ventilation may be manual: • mouth-to-mouth or -nose for infants (use a compress barrier); • mouth-to-mask; • bag-valve-mask; • bag-valve-endotracheal tube or surgical airway; or mechanical, provided by a ventilator. In hospital surroundings it is possible to administer supplemental oxygen, either by a central oxygen supply, compressed cylinders, or an oxygen extractor/concentrator. The ICRC usually operates in situations of limited resources, and mechanical ventilators are not standard equipment. Few patients can be maintained for any length of time using manual ventilation by nurses and doctors. Furthermore, in a mass casualty situation the principles of triage will apply and most patients requiring assisted ventilation will be Category IV; therefore, it will not be performed (see Chapter 9).

In addition to any blood loss, big soft-tissue wounds sequestrate a great deal of tissue oedema with further loss  of plasma and circulating volume. Dehydration complicates any previous fluid loss if evacuation is long and delayed. Neurogenic, anaphylactic, and cardiogenic shock may also occur; septic shock is a late complication. Injury to the spinal cord causing quadri- or paraplegia will result in neurogenic shock due to a disproportion between blood volume and dilated vascular bed.

{"text": "\n## 8.5.1 Pericardial tamponade and pericardiocentesis\n\n In the rare instance of constrictive haemopericardium with cardiac tamponade due to a penetrating missile wound to the heart, pericardiocentesis may be required if there is acute decompensation, to gain time until emergency thoracotomy can be performed. The procedure for pericardiocentesis is as follows. 1. A 20 ml syringe is attached to a long over-the-needle cannula (or alternatively a spinal anaesthesia needle).  The skin is punctured 1 – 2 cm to the left of the xiphisternal junction, 2. at a 45° angle, and the needle advanced through fascia and muscle. 3. (The inner trocar is now removed if using a spinal needle – but not if using the nedle of the cannula). The needle is gently advanced while aiming at the tip of the left scapula and 4. applying continuous suction on the syringe. 5. When the needle tip enters the pericardial sac, blood will immediately appear in the syringe. The needle is withdrawn if using a cannula, which is then advanced into the sac. 6. As much blood as possible is aspirated. If the tamponade has been relieved, the patient’s condition improves immediately; if the right ventricle has been entered, there is no change. 7. At the end of aspiration, the synthetic over-the-needle cannula can be left in place with a 3-way stopcock valve. (The spinal needle is gently withdrawn, millimetre-by-millimetre, if this technique is being used). 8. Should the tamponade return quickly, the stopcock can be re-opened and 9. The patient should immediately be taken to theatre! An emergency room thoracotomy should not be performed when the operating theatre is just down the corridor: it is as pointless as it is dangerous in most hospitals around the world. WAR SURGERY"}
{"text": "\n## 8.5.2 Haemorrhagic shock\n\n \n## Types of haemorrhage\n\n Haemorrhage may be arterial, venous or capillary and blood loss may be: • peripheral and obvious (blood clot the size of a fist or an open wound the size of a hand represents 500 ml); • peripheral and hidden: – closed fractures of long bones (tibia = 500 ml, femur = 1.5 litres); – open wound with small entry that is blocked by a piece of torn muscle; • central (chest, abdomen, pelvis and retroperitoneum) – significant bleeding into the chest should have been diagnosed during the breathing phase of the initial examination; a massive haemothorax can represent 2 – 3 litres of blood, a severe fracture of the pelvis 3 litres. Penetrating trauma causing central bleeding into a body cavity requires surgery of some sort, and severe internal haemorrhage may require urgent operation as part of the resuscitation process. Such patients have a high priority for surgery. Direct pressure and elevation of the limb will stop most cases of peripheral venous and capillary haemorrhage. Fractures should be splinted. If a bleeding blood vessel can be seen in the depths of a wound, and only if it is clearly visible, direct control may be obtained with haemostatic artery forceps. Otherwise, severe peripheral bleeding can usually be stopped by packing the wound. Digital pressure is applied to the artery proximal to the wound (pressure point), while the wound is carefully packed with small quantities of gauze compress at first, followed by a more bulky dressing, and finally a firm compressive elastic bandage in order to apply even pressure to achieve haemostasis. Alternatively, and if available, a pneumatic tourniquet can be used to temporarily control severe arterial haemorrhage while bringing the patient to the operating theatre. Once a wound has been packed and bleeding has been arrested, the dressing (or tourniquet) should not be removed until the patient has been resuscitated and is in the operating theatre, with blood ready for transfusion if available. The surgical team should be ready to arrest bleeding by rapid intervention to obtain access to and control of the major blood vessels. In the same manner of thinking, implanted bullets and fragments, or other foreign bodies in the wound, should only be removed as part of the operative procedure."}
{"text": "\n## Beware of removing packs from missile wounds, as the resultant bleeding can be torrential and difficult to control.\n\n \n## The body’s response and classes of shock\n\n Immediately after haemorrhage, the body initiates a number of homeostatic circulatory changes that aim to stop the bleeding as well as compensate and preserve perfusion of the vital organs. The circulating blood volume represents 7 – 8% of body weight in the adult (5 – 5.6 litres in the 70-kg male or 70 ml/kg body weight) and 9% in children (80 ml/kg body weight). Haemorrhage and the shock response are traditionally graded into 4 classes according to the volume of acute blood loss."}

{"text": "\n## 8.5.3\n\n \n## Fluid replacement\n\n The important point is to maintain adequate tissue perfusion until the haemorrhage is brought under control. Sufficient blood pressure to maintain this tissue perfusion is judged to be a systolic pressure of 90 mm Hg, equivalent to a palpable radial pulse. The great majority of war-wounded patients are relatively healthy young adults who suffer injuries to the extremities, and in whom the amount of blood loss is not lethal. They are haemodynamically stable (Class I blood loss) and the usefulness of oral fluids for their resuscitation – in the field and in hospital – is probably underestimated. Head, thoracic and abdominal injuries, however, even with Class I blood loss, should always have an intravenous line placed. In massive injury, with obviously gross blood loss, several wide-bore intravenous lines should be established. A venous cut-down may be required if shock is profound. Available sites include: median basilic or cephalic in the arm, greater saphenous in the groin, and the distal saphenous vein at the medial malleolus. A venous cut-down should be used for less than 24 hours, or until the patient is filled up with fluids and another i.v. line can be put in. The site of the wounds will influence where i.v. lines are placed. Modern practice has been to give a fluid challenge and monitor the response. The challenge has usually been with 2 l of isotonic crystalloid solution ² in 30 minutes, or 3 ml for every 1 ml of estimated blood lost as a general rule of thumb. (Except for very large estimates: 3,000 ml blood loss would require 9,000 ml Ringers lactate!). The fluid challenge for a child is calculated as 20 ml/kg body weight for the initial bolus of Ringers lactate. 2 Ringers lactate is the preferred resuscitation fluid in ICRC practice. WAR SURGERY"}
{"text": "\n## Monitoring of clinical response\n\n The estimation of blood loss is a very approximate measure, however. Rather than relying on this to guide resuscitation efforts, the doctor should observe the signs and symptoms of the clinical response to determine continuing fluid requirements. These include: • systolic blood pressure, • pulse pressure difference between systolic and diastolic, • capillary refill, • urine output, and • mental status. The most important simple parameter for the adequacy of fluid replacement is urine output : a urine flow of 0.5 – 1 ml/kg body weight/hour, and even greater in case of crush syndrome, should be aimed for. The clinical response to a fluid challenge can be summarized as follows."}
{"text": "\n## Rapid and stable response:\n\n The pulse falls below 100, the systolic blood pressure rises above 100, and the pulse pressure widens. Urine output is good. These measurements remain stable. No further fluid resuscitation is required; the i.v. line is maintained open, however. This is the usual result with Class II and some Class III blood loss."}
{"text": "\n## Transient unstable response:\n\n An initial positive response of the pulse, blood pressure, and pulse pressure is followed by a return to subnormal values. Urine output remains low. A further challenge with Ringers lactate or a plasma expander (dextran 70, colloid, etc.) is called for. A return to normal values indicates compensated Class III blood loss, but early surgery is still required. Continuing subnormal shock values indicate continuing blood loss; the patient should be prepared for emergency surgery."}
{"text": "\n## Please note:\n\n Not more than two units of colloid or dextran should be given in any 24-hour period; besides being more expensive, colloids are less effective than Ringers lactate in diffusing into the interstitial space and can help provoke coagulation defects and interfere with cross-matching."}
{"text": "\n## No response:\n\n The patient remains in shock, indicating Class IV blood loss of more than 40% blood volume, and requires emergency surgery – surgery as part of resuscitation – or is triaged to Category IV in a mass casualty situation (see Chapter 9); other, less common pathologies that become manifest with time have been overlooked. The airway and breathing should be re-assessed to diagnose a possible cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, or myocardial injury. Neurogenic shock and acute gastric dilatation should not be overlooked. Time since injury should also be taken into account to evaluate the evolution of the shock state. If grade IV shock is present less than 1 hour after injury, emergency operation is needed for resuscitation. If grade IV shock has developed in 4 hours, resuscitation is required before operation."}
{"text": "\n## Warning!\n\n Beware of resuscitation injury: \"shock lung\" or acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients who receive massive crystalloid infusions that overburden the heart and lungs. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM CARE"}
{"text": "\n## 8.5.4 Hypotensive resuscitation\n\n Giving all shocked patients a standard fluid challenge of 2 litres or more has been called into question. A rapid return to normal blood pressure before bleeding is controlled can be associated with hydraulic disruption of an effective blood clot (\"popping the clot\"), a dilution of clotting factors, and a lowering of blood viscosity that causes a decrease in resistance to flow around an incomplete clot. All of these factors may cause bleeding that has temporarily stopped to start again, especially if it is a non-compressible central haemorrhage. Thus, moderate resuscitation may be better than aggressive resuscitation; raising the systolic blood pressure to only 90 mm Hg rather than to over 100. This is known as \"hypotensive resuscitation\" and should be considered in Class III and IV blood loss. It should not be used in head trauma where any hypotension is deleterious, or in the very young or old. Therefore, in cases of massive haemorrhage, one must strive for a balance between death from shock after primary exsanguination or an increase in bleeding by prevention of clot formation or dislodging of formed and effective blood clot with secondary haemorrhage. In these extreme cases, surgery to stop haemorrhage is part of resuscitation: this should never be forgotten. Hypotensive resuscitation is widely used by ICRC surgeons today for patients who arrive quickly at a hospital. However, if evacuation is delayed (more than 6 – 12 hours), rebleeding is less likely. In addition, delayed evacuation will result in more profound shock because of plasma loss due to post-traumatic tissue oedema and general dehydration rather than pure blood loss. Excessive sweating, vomiting or diarrhoea, rough handling of the casualty during transport, and a lack of splinting of fractured limbs will aggravate the total fluid and electrolyte loss. More aggressive resuscitation is permissible under these circumstances and the patient should be fully hydrated prior to surgery."}
{"text": "\n## 8.5.5\n\n \n## Adjuvant therapy\n\n"}
{"text": "\n## Never give cold fluids by rapid intravenous infusion.\n\n No effort should be spared to prevent hypothermia in the shocked patient. Intravenous fluids should be warmed (see Section 8.8.1 and Chapter 18). Oxygen and small doses of i.v. analgesia are equally important. The best is morphine (5 mg i.v., repeated every 10 minutes as necessary). Morphine should not be given if there is any question of head injury or respiratory depression. A good alternative in this case would be tramadol. Analgesia in shock should be given  intravenously only. A naso-gastric tube to empty the stomach and prevent gastric dilatation should not be overlooked. Steroids or a \"vitamin C cocktail\" should not be administered in cases of haemorrhagic shock. Some clinical experiments have taken place using hypertonic saline for resuscitation. ICRC surgical teams have no experience in this and cannot comment."}
{"text": "\n## 8.6\n\n \n## Blood transfusion where supplies are limited\n\n Where blood supplies are scarce, what should the role of blood transfusion be? This scenario is a far cry from optimal conditions in which there are relatively few limits to blood or component administration, yet it is common. The aim of blood transfusion is to save life or to prevent significant morbidity, and not to restore a normal haemoglobin level. Blood is a rare and expensive commodity with serious risks attached to its administration and it should therefore be used with caution. The decision to give blood to a particular patient should be based primarily on the clinical state correlated with the laboratory findings, balanced against the WAR SURGERY risks and the shortage of supply. A better understanding of the physiology of oxygen transport, the shortage of donors and the increased risk of viral infections has led to a policy of accepting lower levels of haemoglobin than before, without overly detrimental effects to the patient. One should avoid a transfusion for reasons such as “accelerating the patient’s recovery”, increasing patient comfort, or providing a supplement to correct anaemia. (Certain medical conditions, such as small children with severe malaria are an exception to this last rule.) ICRC policy is to screen donated blood for hepatitis B and C, HIV, syphilis, and – in non- endemic areas – malaria. In countries where malaria is endemic, it is not uncommon for trauma patients to have a malarial attack 2 to 3 days post-operatively even without a blood transfusion; this is treated when it occurs. Where donors are scare, they are not excluded because of malaria. A blood transfusion can never be 100% safe. The ICRC seeks blood donors in the community. Family, friends and clan members are usually the source. In certain countries, the National Red Cross/Red Crescent Society plays an important role in the collection of blood. Culture and tradition in some societies may render blood collection extremely difficult; consequently, blood for transfusion is often in very short supply. Accordingly, and in keeping with the principles of triage, a maximum number of units of blood per intervention is set in ICRC practice. Today, this is usually about 4 units, and this figure should only be exceeded in cases of anti-personnel landmine injury with traumatic amputation and severe burn patients undergoing skin grafting. (Early tangential debridement with immediate skin grafting is not practised by ICRC teams, partly because of the risk of major blood loss.) ICRC practice has been to transfuse whole blood, as fresh as possible. Otherwise, whole blood is stored with CPD-A anticoagulant (citrate – phosphate – dextrose – adenine). Blood components are not available in ICRC surgical programmes as is the case in many rural public hospitals. In practice, this has not been considered a handicap."}
{"text": "\n## Clinical use of blood in ICRC practice 8.6.1\n\n • Blood should not be given during resuscitation until bleeding has been controlled. • Crystalloids and/or colloids are administered first: if the patient remains haemodynamically unstable and the haemoglobin is less than 6 g/dl, blood is administered. Haemoglobin less than 6 but in a stable patient is not an indication for transfusion. (However, there is a threshold haematocrit value of 5 – 10%, below which continued crystalloids or colloids can provoke cardiac arrest by \"washout anaemia\". 3) • In the non-resuscitation scenario (preparing the patient for a second operation), pre-operative transfusions are not administered where blood supplies are low, unless the patient is anaemic and symptomatic. • The blood supply and stocks determine whether a particular patient will receive • Consider autotransfusion where appropriate (see Section 8.6.4). If massive transfusion of stored blood is necessary, every second unit should be supplemented with one ampoule of sodium bicarbonate (44.3 mEq) and one ampoule of calcium chloride (10 g) by a separate i.v. line. As with crystalloid fluids, blood should be warmed to body temperature to avoid increasing hypothermia. This can be achieved through the use of locally-made water baths or the body heat of staff members."}
{"text": "\n## 8.6.2 Two unit rule\n\n It has been traditional practice to administer not less than 2 units of blood to any patient who requires transfusion.

No differentiation was made for blood transfusion given pre-operatively, peri-operatively, or immediately post-operatively: all were considered part of patient resuscitation given the difficulties and delay in obtaining blood. Guidelines at the time allocated a maximum of 6 units per patient (although this was exceeded in some cases) and a limiting haemoglobin level of 8 g/dl. Autotransfusion was not used in this series. A comparison was made of the number of units transfused according to time since injury for all wounded patients and separately for those with central injuries (head, neck, chest, and abdomen), and according to the cause of injury. Need for transfusion was greatest for patients arriving less than six hours after injury, steadily decreasing to those arriving after 72 hours. This was true for all patients. Surprisingly, patients with central injuries required less blood, on average, than those with peripheral wounds. The most remarkable results were associated with the cause of injury. Blood requirement for anti-personnel landmine injuries far exceeded that for bullets or fragments, (Table 8.3) and was the main reason for the high blood use in peripheral injuries.

WAR SURGERY Consequently, ICRC recommendations for a hospital undertaking total surgical care of the wounded from conventional warfare were amended as follows: • for every 100 war-wounded patients, the blood bank should expect to provide 45 units as a baseline; • baseline should be increased to 60 units, if the majority of patients are admitted within 6 hours of injury; • baseline should be increased to 100 units, if anti-personnel landmines are widely used in combat; • burn patients require greater transfusion capacities, even in the absence of early tangential excision with immediate grafting (not practised in ICRC hospitals); • Iong evacuation lines with much delay and no use of anti-personnel landmines in combat may negate the need for a blood bank, and blood for transfusion should be collected on an individual patient basis. These recommendations may have little relevance to a modern industrialized army with very early evacuation and resuscitation but may be quite relevant in conditions of limited resources."}

Although the GCS was originally intended for closed trauma to the head, and there are certain shortcomings when dealing with penetrating head trauma, nonetheless, it has been ICRC practice to use it.

With a core body temperature of 37° C, an ambient temperature of 32 – 34° C is considered neutral. Less than this and the body loses heat to the environment. After examination, the patient should be kept covered, even in a tropical climate."}
{"text": "\n## 8.8.1\n\n \n## “Fatal triad” of coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia\n\n Recently, the importance of the potentially \"fatal triad\" of hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy in trauma patients has become recognized. Hypothermia (core temperature less than 35° C) is probably the most potent factor in causing the vicious cycle of this syndrome. Every effort should be made to preserve heat in an injured patient, since rewarming consumes far more energy than maintaining normothermia. Warm inhaled O., warm i.v. fluids, and external rewarming to a maximum of 40 – 42° C should be the first step. More aggressive measures of \"central reheating\" such as rectal enema and gastric, bladder and peritoneal lavage (at 37° C) can be used. Post-traumatic coagulopathy is a well-recognized danger in patients suffering severe shock and submitted to aggressive resuscitation, especially if they have received massive amounts of i.v. fluids and blood transfusions with stored blood. It results from a combination of factors. Fresh whole blood transfusion is very useful in the absence of blood components, and probably in their presence as well (see Chapter 18)."}
{"text": "\n## 8.9 Complete examination\n\n At this stage it is even more important than in the pre-hospital setting to undress the patient and perform a thorough examination, from head to toe, front and back and sides. In some societies, this may contravene certain cultural and religious traditions (male doctor examining a female patient). Compromises must be found. In the more accommodating atmosphere of a hospital emergency room, a systematic approach should be used to thoroughly examine the scalp and head (mouth, nose, and ears), neck, thorax, abdomen, perineum (scrotum and urethra, rectum, and vagina), the back of the trunk and buttocks, and the extremities. The peripheral pulses, temperature and capillary refill are compared on both sides. Motor function of the main peripheral nerves is tested. The aim is to have a complete assessment of all injuries and a more accurate assessment of the organ-specific damage. The complete examination is best described as a thorough palpation. The entry wound may be exceedingly small and not seen. This is especially the case with fragment wounds to the head or perineum where body hair matted with blood can easily hide the wound (Figure 8.6). The entry wound must be identified by close palpation. Remember also that contusion/erythema can be better felt rather than seen in dark-skinned people. WAR SURGERY Figure 8.6 Small temporo- zygomatic entry wound hidden by One should attempt to identify the likely path through the body of the projectile. This may involve any structure between the entry and exit wounds, or the position of the projectile on X-ray if no exit exists. Remember that wounds to the chest, buttock, thigh or perineum may involve the abdominal cavity (Figures 8.7.1 – 8.7.3). Figure 8.7.1 Figure 8.7.2 Figure 8.7.3 Figure 8.7.1 Bullet wound to the pelvis: the entry is located on the right side. A defunctioning colostomy has ben performed. Figure 8.7.2 Any structure between entry and exit should be identified: here blood is seen in the rectum. A simple outline drawing of the body on the admission chart (homunculus), front and back, is useful for recording all injuries. Dressings on the limbs should not be removed if the casualty is haemodynamically unstable. Only once resuscitation has begun and the patient’s condition is under control is it safe to examine wounds to the extremities, preferably in the operating theatre. Fractures should nonetheless be immobilized if this has not already been done in the field. The ABCDE paradigm should be monitored for any change in condition of the patient. Resuscitation and stabilization are continued, while complementary examinations are performed. The extent of the latter will depend on the level of sophistication and competency of the particular hospital. A basic complement is a plain X-ray, one body cavity above and below any entry or exit wound. If no exit wound exists and no projectile is evident, further radiographs should be taken to locate its position. It may be difficult to differentiate a radio- opaque bullet from a normal anatomic radio-opacity such as the heart shadow (see Chapter 10 and Figures 8.4.2 and 14.9.1). The complete and definitive examination will involve each specialized body system. The signs, symptoms, and treatment will be described in the relevant chapters of Volume 2.

The use of central venous pressure lines in most circumstances where the ICRC works carries too high a risk of septicaemia. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage for abdominal injury is also not practised routinely. The minimal ICRC standards for emergency war surgery under precarious circumstances in hospital settings with limited resources include: • plain X-ray; • pulse oxymeter; • haemoglobin; • haematocrit; • total and differential white blood cell count; • platelet count; • coagulation time; • bleeding time; • fasting blood sugar; • blood smear for malaria (other blood parasites where applicable); • sickle-cell test (where applicable); • urine analysis: dipsticks, pregnancy tests; If more general surgery, as well as internal medicine and paediatrics, is widely practised in the ICRC hospital, then more elaborate laboratory analyses are added. In more precarious situations, as experienced by field surgical teams, none of the above is usually available.

{"text": "\n## The logic of triage 9.1.1\n\n  In daily, routine practice surgeons face patients one by one. They use all of the means, equipment, and supplies at hand to do the most they can for every patient; they try to do everything they possibly can for every single individual. The priority is high- In a single multiple-casualty incident means may be stretched to the limit, but one can still manage to do the best possible for all patients. With a massive influx of wounded, however, the hospital is overwhelmed; resources cannot meet the needs of all the casualties. This is when the logic of mass casualty triage comes into play. It is no longer possible to do everything for everyone. Medics must try to do what they can: the greatest good – but not necessarily everything – for the greatest number. This is another example of the change in professional \"software\" – the mindset – that  is called for in surgery for the victims of war."}
{"text": "\n## A change of mindset: from “everything for everyone” to “best for most”.\n\n The French term triage , which means to sort into groups according to quality, has been applied to the sorting of battle casualties since the time of Napoleon's surgeon of the Imperial Guard, Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey (circa 1812), who recognized the need to categorize wounded soldiers during an actual battle according to their priority for treatment. The experience of two world wars during the twentieth century, when tens of thousands were wounded during a single battle, demonstrated the importance of sorting casualties and determining priorities for evacuation and treatment. This concept of triage has now been extended to natural disasters and single mass- casualty incidents (terrorist bombings, industrial accidents, fires in social institutions, etc.) with considerable benefit, and its use is now generally accepted worldwide. Natural disaster triage, however, is not the same as war triage. An important natural disaster is a single mass-casualty event that overwhelms hospital services; the wounded suffer injuries at one time, but there is then a respite. The same can be said for other mass-casualty accidents. Armed conflict on the other hand can involve a continuing mass arrival of freshly wounded victims that may go on for weeks or months on end; there may be no respite until the end of hostilities. Nonetheless, many of the fundamental concepts underlying war triage apply to the disaster scenario. Establishing priorities for treatment amongst many casualties is the most difficult decision to be taken in all of medical practice. Patients with very severe wounds whose management consumes many resources and much time, and who have little chance of survival despite treatment, may have to wait or may only receive minimal care in the interest of being able to intervene effectively for the others. One must often choose to treat first the patients for whom the smallest surgery gives the biggest results; i.e. the wounded who, though seriously injured, stand a fair chance of \"good survival\"."}
{"text": "\n## The aim in a mass casualty situation is to do the “best for most”.\n\n Some armies have practised \"inverted\" or \"reverse\" triage: the least injured were treated first so as to make them able to return more quickly to the battlefield! It should be noted that this practice contradicts the principles of international humanitarian law. The practice of triage is not dogmatic. It is not a series of rules, but a logical approach and philosophy that must be adapted to each and every particular situation. WAR SURGERY"}
{"text": "\n## 9.1.2  Where to perform triage\n\n As mentioned in Chapter 1, one of the special characteristics of surgery in times of war is the staged management of patients in a chain of casualty care. The principles of triage are applied at every stage."}
{"text": "\n##  Triage takes place at every echelon of the chain of casualty care, including during evacuation.\n\n The organization of a casualty collection point and effective triage permits the orderly evacuation of the wounded, the most efficient use of stretchers, ambulances or other transport, and the optimal use of the personnel available. With the necessary training, rapid assessment of casualties can be carried out not only by doctors, but also by nurses, paramedical staff and first-aid workers. It should be possible to implement triage at any point along the chain of casualty care, in order to set priorities for first aid and evacuation of the wounded to the next echelon of treatment. More efficient lines of evacuation and shorter duration of transport, coupled with better pre-hospital care, ensure that a greater number of the severely injured will survive to reach a surgical hospital. The number of KIA decreases; however, the DOW rate often increases (see Chapter 5). In many low-income countries, however, civilian casualties often arrive at the hospital without having received first aid and without the help of an ambulance service. In this case the less seriously injured usually arrive first. The hospital then becomes the first triage station. Whatever the prior treatment or sorting, however, triage must be carried out again when casualties reach the hospital; the condition of patients changes and the priorities in the hospital may be different from those in the field. All patients arriving at the hospital during an influx of casualties go through the triage process. 1"}
{"text": "\n## A delicate balance 9.1.3\n\n To set priorities for patient management a number of factors must be taken into consideration to define the needs on the one hand, and the resources available on Triage is a dynamic equilibrium between needs and resources: • needs = number of wounded and types of wounds; • resources = facilities at hand and number of competent personnel available."}
{"text": "\n## Needs\n\n • How many patients are arriving? 10, 50 or 100? • Are they all suffering from penetrating injuries? Or are there many burn cases amongst them? The number of wounded and the different pathologies should be taken into account in the total workload. Penetrating wounds will require a great deal of surgery. Burn patients require relatively little immediate surgery, but a great deal of nursing care. For field triage, see Giannou C, Bernes E. First Aid in Armed Conflicts and Other Situations of Violence. Geneva: ICRC; HOSPITAL TRIAGE OF MASS CASUALTIES"}
{"text": "\n## Resources\n\n • How many surgeons and anaesthetists? • How many operating tables? • How many instrument boxes, and what is the efficiency of the sterilization system? • How many beds? etc. A hospital may have three fully-equipped operating theatres, but if there is only one surgeon then only one patient can be operated at a time. If there are three surgeons and three anaesthetists, but only one theatre, then the team must improvise extra operating facilities, if there are sufficient boxes of surgical instruments."}
{"text": "\n## ICRC EXPERIENCE\n\n During fighting in Kabul in 1992 with an influx of mass casualties, four surgical teams worked in the ICRC hospital, supplemented by Afghan general practitioners with some surgical experience. There were two operating theatres in different buildings with 4 tables that could function at the same time. One team operated in one building and one in the other; the third team performed triage; and the fourth was resting! All these factors – needs and resources – must be balanced out. No two triage situations are the same. It is this constantly changing equilibrium between needs and resources that will determine the priority for treatment among all the patients who reach the hospital. One cannot be dogmatic about which patient to operate first, since no two situations are the same. Only a full understanding of the logic and philosophy  of triage will help to establish efficient priorities that will result in the best treatment possible for the greatest number of victims."}
{"text": "\n## 9.2\n\n \n## Setting priorities: the ICRC triage system\n\n There are a number of triage category systems used throughout the world today. Some are more sophisticated than others and depend on injury severity scores and physiological parameters. There are two important factors to keep in mind when 1. It should be kept as simple as possible – a mass influx of wounded always creates confusion, tension and anxiety. 2. All members of the hospital team should understand the system being used. The ICRC uses a triage category system based upon several factors. • Physiological appreciation of life-threatening conditions according to the ABCDE protocol – in practice, severe haemorrhage will constitute the great majority of life- threatening injuries during armed conflict (see Chapters 5 and 8). • Anatomic factors, including the Red Cross Wound Score for penetrating injuries – in general, vital injuries (head, neck, thorax, abdomen and major peripheral vessels) will have priority, but the grade of injury must also be taken into consideration (see Chapter 4). • Mechanism of injury – especially anti-personnel landmine injuries and burns • Time since injury – important for determining degree of shock and response to resuscitation as well as limb ischaemia (see Chapter 5). • Epidemiology of the war-wounded – knowledge of the relative numbers of severe and superficial wounds (see Chapter 5). WAR SURGERY The ICRC triage categories² 9.2.1"}
{"text": "\n## Category l: Serious wounds – resuscitation and immediate surgery\n\n Patients who need lifesaving surgery and have a good chance of recovery. Some • airway – injuries or burns to the face and neck requiring tracheostomy; • breathing – tension pneumothorax, major haemothorax; • circulation – internal haemorrhage, wounds to major peripheral blood vessels, traumatic amputation."}
{"text": "\n## Category II: Second priority wounds – can wait for surgery \n\n Patients who require surgery but not on an urgent basis. In practice this applies to many casualties, including: • penetrating abdominal injury in haemodynamically stable patient, most probably injury to hollow organs only; • penetrating head injuries with GCS > 8, providing definitive airway control can be maintained – if a surgical airway is necessary, then Category I for tracheostomy oly; 3 • most compound fractures: in practice, a large number of the wounded; • major soft-tissue wounds: in practice, a large number of the wounded."}
{"text": "\n## Category III: Superficial wounds – ambulatory management\n\n Patients who do not require hospitalization and/or surgery because their wounds are so minor that they can be managed on an ambulatory basis. They are often called the \"walking-wounded\". In practice, this is a very large group including those presenting superficial wounds managed under local anaesthesia in the emergency room or with simple first-aid measures."}
{"text": "\n## Category IV: Severe wounds – supportive treatment\n\n Patients with injuries so severe that they are unlikely to survive or would have a very poor quality of survival. These include the moribund, or patients with multiple major injuries whose management could be considered wasteful of scarce resources in a • penetrating head wound with GCS < 8; • quadriplegia; • major blood loss and no blood available. 2 The system of triage categories employed by the ICRC was revised by the Master Surgeons Workshop held in Geneva in 2002 (see Introduction) 3  always possible. A surgical airway avoids many problems, and should replace an endotracheal tube if the patient remains intubated for several days in any case HOSPITAL TRIAGE OF MASS CASUALTIES"}
{"text": "\n## 9.2.2 Notes on triage categories\n\n The number of casualties who require urgent treatment may exceed the surgical capacity available. A second triage within Category I is then necessary (see Section 9.3.2). On the other hand, when evacuation time to the hospital is longer than 12 hours, few patients may fall into Category I. Many surgeons believe that all penetrating brain wounds are a Category I emergency; others believe that they are all hopeless Category IV. The use of the GCS helps to differentiate those patients who will probably survive, even with some delay in operation (Category II in the experience of ICRC surgical teams) from those whose condition is definitely a Category IV. This, evidently, provided the airway is patent. The Category III superficially wounded may be so numerous, frightened, in pain and excited, that their uncontrolled presence in the emergency room/triage area creates great confusion. In urban contexts, they tend to be the very first evacuated to hospital, to the detriment of the more seriously wounded. The categories are not rigid; patients waiting for surgery may change category and a single patient may fall into two categories, such as one with severe maxillo-facial injury who requires an immediate tracheostomy and basic haemostasis (Category I), while the debridement and primary reconstruction of the patient’s face, which may take many hours, can wait (Category II). There is one exception to these categories: when an excited, and often drunk, combatant holds a gun to your head and demands that you treat his wounded comrade first. This patient immediately becomes top priority."}
{"text": "\n## ICRC EXPERIENCE\n\n Two examples of the epidemiology of triage patients recorded in recent years. Fighting in Kisangani, Democratic Republic of the Congo, June 2000 Four hospitals and 62 clinics registered a total of 2,393 wounded. Only 25 % required hospital care, and even less a surgical operation. The vast majority were Category III and could have been treated as ambulatory cases; many were hospitalized for several days nonetheless.  Combat in Monrovia, Liberia, June – August 2003 2,567 patients were triaged in the JFK Memorial Hospital, but only 1,015 were deemed to require hospital admission (40%), only 718 of whom (71%) underwent operation. Of those admitted, some did not require any operation (paraplegia), while for many others there was simply not enough time or human resources available. Many patients who were originally placed in Category II – and given antibiotics, dressings and analgesia – eventually became Category III, with and without sequelae. The equilibrium – between needs and resources – is a dynamic one; change is constant, no two triage situations are the same. WAR SURGERY"}
{"text": "\n## 9.3\n\n How to perform triage"}
{"text": "\n## Triage is a dynamic process: it requires a continuous  reassessment of patients.\n\n Patients may change triage category: their condition may deteriorate, or improve over time and with pre-operative resuscitation. As a result, a continuous reassessment of Triage is a multiple-step process: \"sift and sort\", then re-examine, re-examine, re-examine. \"Sift\" involves placing the patient in a general Category; \"sort\" then decides priority within that Category."}
{"text": "\n## 9.3.1\n\n \n## \"Sift\"\n\n On reception of the casualties in the hospital, the triage officer must perform a rapid examination of each patient – a maximum of 30 seconds – checking the whole body, including the back. Field dressings should be changed by the nursing team as part of the examination; except for obviously large and severe wounds whose dressings are removed only in theatre. Severity of injury and probability of survival are the keys to decision-making. Clinical experience with the war-wounded – not training or reading books – is the most important preparation for this task. To sift, the triage officer first looks for life-threatening conditions based on: • airway, breathing, circulation; • important physiological clues (mental status, character and rate of pulse, ease of respiration); • anatomic site of wounds (head, chest, abdomen); • severity of obvious wounds according to the RCWS (amputation of limb, etc.). Based on clinical judgement alone, a first decision is made, to \"sift\" the casualty into a Category. The Category does not depend on how many patients arrive with serious wounds."}
{"text": "\n##  Every wounded patient must be examined and   categorized immediately.\n\n The idea is to quickly recognize the two extremes of injury, which, together, comprise a very large number of casualties: the very minor (Category III) and the very serious (Category IV); and to identify and separate out the dead. As little time as possible is spent on these Category III and IV patients and they must quickly be removed from the triage area to specially designated areas. Figure 9.1 Triage officer assisted by an administrative clerk. The triage officer concentrates on the critically and seriously injured (Categories I and II): • patients who require resuscitation and immediate surgery as part of the resuscitation process; • those who need continuing resuscitation; and • patients who will tolerate some delay before receiving surgical attention. The triage officer should not perform treatment , with one exception: if the patient is not breathing, the mouth should be opened and cleaned and the person put in the lateral recovery position, before the next patient is dealt with. An \"administrative team\" consisting of a nurse and a clerk supports the triage officer for purposes of documentation, including all personal details of each patient, the securing of their identity papers and valuables, and the signing of any necessary consent forms. Other supporting personnel present at the entrance or in the triage area include those responsible for hospital security and crowd control. Initial treatment is started by a dedicated team, and patients should be transferred as quickly as possible out of the triage area to theatre or the ward designated for their triage Category in order to make room for new arrivals. Resuscitation, as necessary, is continued in these assigned areas. HOSPITAL TRIAGE OF MASS CASUALTIES  The use of X-rays should be limited ; it is seldom essential under these circumstances and the triage officer should not wait for an X-ray to decide on the triage Category. An identifying tabard or armband stating \"triage officer\" is useful; if, inevitably, the triage officer must move away from the triage area this can be handed over to the deputy/replacement."}
{"text": "\n## 9.3.2\n\n \n## \"Sort\"\n\n After \"sifting\" casualties into the general Categories, a second examination is performed: \"sorting\". No two triage situations are equal and, therefore, according to the number of competent personnel available, the triage officer or a second physician-in-charge continues the reassessment of patients within the Category I cohort. \"Sorting\" decides which of the Category I patients to send to theatre first: priority amongst the priorities . The others, while waiting, remain under close observation and continued resuscitation. This re-examination may reveal patients with an \"emergent\" condition who should receive priority over the stable: e.g. one of two Category I patients with penetrating abdominal wounds becomes haemodynamically unstable because of continuing internal haemorrhage, while the other has a stable pulse and blood pressure because bleeding has stopped. The surgical teams should begin operating on Category I patients immediately. Since the number of casualties cannot be foreseen, it is not possible to wait for all patients to arrive and be triaged before deciding which should be taken to the operating"}
{"text": "\n## When in doubt about priority amongst Category I patients, put in chest tubes and send in a laparotomy; get going! \n\n The triage officer must keep in close contact with the operating theatre, to reassess continuously the priorities of the operating list. The time that patients are waiting for surgery can be profitably used for completing X-rays and laboratory analyses, if necessary, but should not interfere with resuscitation efforts. The same logic applies to the patients in the other Categories. Either the triage officer or the person in charge of the department re-examines the patients in Category II. Priorities are set for the operating list among the Category II patients. Reassessments may result in changing a patient’s Category. The condition of a patient originally triaged into Category III because he had no obviously serious wound may suddenly deteriorate and become Category I or II. If a second-in-charge is continuing the reassessments, a system must be available to transfer patients from one Category area to another. Referring back to the triage officer for every decision will only result in overburdening him. Usually the hardest part of triage is having to accept that some patients may only receive analgesics and be removed to a quiet place where they can die in comfort and with dignity. After treatment of priority patients has been completed, a repeat examination of Category IV patients, if still alive, may allow the triage officer to contemplate surgery for them at this stage."}
{"text": "\n## 9.3.3  Avoid undertriage and overtriage\n\n In undertriage the assessment underestimates the severity of injury and the patient is not given sufficient priority. Overtriage overestimates the injury, and a patient is assigned to a higher Category than necessary. This will divert resources from the truly seriously injured and overburden the critical care services. Repeated re-examinations will correct these errors. WAR SURGERY It may be necessary to transfer minimal care patients to other sites for convalescence, even outside the surgical hospital. If this is done, care should be taken to identify patients for follow-up treatment and administration of medication, and to exercise some control over their whereabouts. Documentation is important: patients can easily get lost."}
{"text": "\n## 9.3.4 Avoid confusion and disagreements within the team\n\n \n## Triage decisions must be respected.\n\n There is no time or place for disagreements during a triage of mass casualties. The decisions of the triage officer must be \"dictatorial\". The post-triage evaluation session is the place for “democratic” discussion and constructive criticism. In spite of training, practising and planning, the unexpected will happen. The hospital team – led by the team leader, triage officer, head nurse – will at times have to improvise and invent new protocols and procedures to meet new circumstances. One should not be dogmatic, but rather understand the philosophy and logic of the triage process, and adapt to new situations in accordance with that logic."}
{"text": "\n## 9.4\n\n \n## Triage documentation\n\n Good records are essential and no effort should be spared to record important aspects  of the wounds, treatment, and the patient’s triage category. Each casualty should be appropriately identified, numbered, and assigned a medical chart. Large plastic bags, labelled with the patient's number, are used for clothing; smaller labelled plastic bags are used to collect patients’ valuables. They are stored separately and the valuables put in a safe place. Some system must be devised for indicating the patient’s triage Category. This could be colour-coded tags tied around a hand or foot, or hung around the neck. These are easily removed and changed should the patient's triage Category change. Writing an \"indelible\" number on the forehead or chest only creates confusion with a change in Category. The patient's medical chart should include basic information and be in telegraphic style: clear, concise, yet complete. It should include at least the following information: • name, age, sex, time of injury, cause of injury, any first aid given; • time of admission to hospital; • vital signs: BP, pulse, respiration rate, neurological status; • diagnosis: using a diagram (homunculus) is very useful; • triage Category; • complete pre-operative orders. See Annex 9. A: Sample triage card. This basic information is particularly important if patients are being transferred to another facility. A list of admitted or treated patients is necessary so that people who come looking for their relatives or friends may be informed. The local authorities may require information about the number of admissions and deaths. The media must be dealt with. These issues are addressed by the triage team leader, or replacement.

The ordinary operating list and other routine activities should be suspended until the situation is resolved. This kind of organization does not require money or special technology; only time, effort, discipline and motivation. Any disaster plan should be an extension of the normal hospital routines, and the roles allocated to individual staff remain as close as possible to their familiar daily work. The plan should not be a complete change in the system. Introducing many new procedures will only add to the confusion."}
{"text": "\n##  A simple emergency plan: personnel, space, infrastructure,\n\n \n## 9.6\n\n"}
{"text": "\n## Personnel\n\n There are three key leadership functions in a disaster triage scenario: triage team leader, triage officer, head nurse."}
{"text": "\n## 9.6.1\n\n \n## Triage team leader\n\n The triage team leader is the coordinator. He is usually designated to announce the onset of the hospital triage plan; he then coordinates the work of the different units and services, and makes sure that all departments are informed. The triage team leader maintains an overview of the situation, including a constant reassessment to determine the need for additional staff, supplies, and ward areas. In addition, he must be aware of events outside the hospital, maintaining contact with relevant authorities  in order to anticipate any new arrival of casualties due to continuing combat."}
{"text": "\n## 9.6.2\n\n \n##  Triage officer\n\n The triage officer performs the actual clinical triage, assigning a category to each and every patient on entry. There has been much discussion about who should perform triage: surgeon or anaesthetist? Again, there is no strict rule. Each hospital team must decide according to its circumstances. The logic of triage demands that the most experienced and respected person willing and able to take on the responsibility should do so. This person must know how to organize the emergency room/triage area and have a good understanding of the functioning and capacity of the hospital. Even more importantly, the hospital team must be able to live with the decisions taken by the triage officer. Staff members, relatives, and military commanders might try to influence the triage decisions; nevertheless, these should be made on purely medical grounds. This can be especially difficult in a public hospital where friends and family members of the hospital staff may be among the victims. Deciding priority of treatment solely on the basis of medical need and resources available when the injured include close relatives of the personnel may be a heart-wrenching decision. HOSPITAL TRIAGE OF MASS CASUALTIES The hospital staff must be able to continue their work and live with the triage decisions for the rest of their lives. As a consequence, the experience of the triage officer and the respect with which the personnel hold the triage officer must be beyond reproach."}
{"text": "\n## Triage Officer\n\n  No task in medicine requires greater understanding, skill, and judgement than the categorization of casualties and the establishment of priorities for treatment."}
{"text": "\n## 9.6.3 Head nurse\n\n The head nurse organizes the nursing and paramedical personnel (laboratory, pharmacy, etc.) and non-medical support staff (trolley orderlies/stretcher-bearers, kitchen, laundry, cleaning, etc.). This is largely a coordination function. Any clinical role or supervision by the head nurse will depend on the particular circumstances of the hospital involved."}
{"text": "\n## 9.6.4 The team\n\n Whether one person fills more than one leadership function will depend on the availability of competent personnel. The triage team leader may be the same as the triage officer in a small hospital; in a larger facility, this coordination function is probably best assigned to someone else, for instance an administrative officer or the head nurse. In a very large hospital, three different people should assume the three functions."}
{"text": "\n##  ICRC EXPERIENCE\n\n \n## What is the reality in the field?\n\n In many small rural hospitals, the only surgeon is also the director. This one person often becomes the triage team leader and triage officer. After performing triage, the surgeon and the only anaesthesia nurse go to the operating theatre. A new influx of casualties arrives. Who then performs triage? Who continues the necessary coordination tasks? Either a general practitioner or the head nurse. This should be decided upon beforehand and be part of the hospital’s disaster plan. The ICRC supports the Somali Red Crescent Society in running the Keysaney Hospital in north Mogadishu, where triage has been routinely practised from 1992 until the time of writing. The triage officer in the emergency room is an experienced female nurse, \"because she is the only one who can organize things\"."}
{"text": "\n## 9.6.5 Triage groups/nursing teams\n\n Such teams should be formed for the triage area, with responsibility for the following tasks. 1. Setting up intravenous lines and taking blood for grouping and cross-matching.  Administration of tetanus prophylaxis, antibiotics, analgesics and other 2. medication as prescribed. Dressing wounds and splinting fractures. 3. Bladder catheterization, if indicated. 4.  Arranging for an orderly flow of categorized casualties to the operating theatre or 5. to designated areas for continuing resuscitation, delayed, or minimal treatment. The disaster plan may be nominative, designating by name the triage officer and triage groups: who is in charge of setting up i.v. lines, dressing wounds, giving analgesics and antibiotics, etc. (Figure 9.5); or it may designate the function (ER doctor 1, ER nurse 3) regardless of who is on the roster that day. This depends on the staffing system, and availability of personnel, of the particular hospital. Example of a nominative disaster/triage plan in a small rural hospital. WAR SURGERY"}
{"text": "\n## 9.6.6\n\n \n## Surgeons and theatre personnel\n\n These members of staff should have prepared the operating theatre and be ready and waiting for the casualties. The surgeon in theatre will see patients he or she has not previously examined and who may not have a known name or signed consent form. Outside the mass casualty situation this would be regarded as negligent practice, and so another “mental adjustment” is required."}
{"text": "\n## 9.6.7\n\n \n## Rest and relief\n\n Early consideration should be given to the rest and relief of staff. Triage is not an everyday routine activity. The shift system may need to be changed in order to deal with the increased workload: 2 twelve-hour shifts instead of 3 eight-hour ones, for example. During a crisis the hospital team will be under severe emotional and physical stress. All staff members will need to pace themselves in order to perform efficiently and maintain a professional attitude. As mentioned before, during armed conflict there may be a mass arrival of new casualties every day for weeks on end. It is not possible to foresee how long the influx will last."}
{"text": "\n## ICRC EXPERIENCE\n\n At the beginning of the fighting in Monrovia in 2003, the surgical team worked 48 hours non-stop, without sleep: they were not able to continue operating. Subsequently, a strict 18-hour operating schedule was instituted: the team was able to maintain this schedule for three months. A triage situation is tiring for everyone. Some, out of a misplaced sense of professional duty, find it difficult to accept that they need to rest; rest must be insisted upon. Working for extended periods without sleep only results in hospital staff no longer being able to adequately treat the new patients who continue to arrive."}
{"text": "\n## 9.7\n\n \n## Space\n\n During an influx of mass casualties the various hospital departments must be re-arranged according to the pre-decided plan. Besides the original hospital site, any alternative sites (building, underground shelter, etc.) must be included in the plan, should the hospital require evacuation for reasons of security. The equivalent in cases of natural disaster is the destruction of the hospital premises and/or its access routes (earthquake, landslide, tsunami, etc.). Figure 9.6.1 Alternative triage department in an unused building: empty. Figure 9.6.2 The same premises: full. The same premises: full. The usual emergency reception/admissions room may not be large enough to accommodate a large influx of wounded. A large and extendable area capable of serving as a triage department should be pre-selected. The area should be cleared of all inpatients,  and be large enough to permit easy movement of casualties and medical personnel. HOSPITAL TRIAGE OF MASS CASUALTIES In certain contexts, for religious and cultural reasons, it may be necessary to have separate male and female areas for incoming mass casualties. This must be taken into account during planning. Once triaged, patients should be transferred out of the triage department to the operating theatre or designated wards. Different units or wards should be identified for the different triage categories. Category I patients, requiring resuscitation and immediate surgery, might be put in a pre-operative intensive care unit near the operating theatre while waiting for an operating table to free up. Resuscitation with i.v. fluids can continue here under close supervision. The Category II cohort of patients who require surgery but not on an urgent basis can be grouped in a special ward where they can receive treatment (antibiotics, analgesics, i.v. fluids, dressings) under observation while awaiting surgery. Category III patients suffering superficial wounds could be sent to the outpatient department or an area for convalescence outside the surgical hospital. This group is composed of many patients who are lucid, frightened (because of the shooting and shelling), panicky, and often in pain. Organization and basic staffing of this space are important in order to identify and isolate such patients, give them rapid treatment, and then discharge them. Finally, a quiet, secluded room should be made available for Category IV patients with very severe wounds who should be left to die peacefully with dignity. An i.v. line should be put up and analgesics given if appropriate. Some provisions should be made for the well-regulated visit of friends and relatives to all seriously-injured patients. This comes under the necessary security measures to be implemented (see Section 9.13)."}
{"text": "\n## 9.8\n\n \n## Equipment and supplies\n\n A large number of stretchers or trolleys are needed at the hospital entrance during triage, to accommodate the casualties left by incoming ambulances. Blankets and sheets are required in the triage area, as are lines on which to hang infusions. Complete sets of supplies for triage should be prepared and stored in boxes or trunks Triage boxes should include: • disposable latex or plastic gloves; • venepuncture equipment; • i.v. fluids; • dressings, bandages, scissors; • catheters, naso-gastric tubes, etc.; • drugs which are likely to be needed. Needless to say, these triage boxes should be inspected regularly for the expiration date of their components. The drugs will probably need to be stored separately. Stocks should include the appropriate antibiotics and analgesics, as well as tetanus toxoid and anti-tetanus serum. A reasonable stock of items that will be required for the management of extra cases in the wards should be maintained. There should be adequate numbers of bed blocks for elevation of the foot of the bed, supplies of i.v. bottle holders, and supplies of dressings, plaster of Paris, splints and traction apparatus. Again, depending on the particular circumstances of the hospital, the pharmacy may hold designated emergency triage stocks or not. The re-supply of the hospital may be disrupted because combat has interrupted the ordinary lines of supply. Standard documentation charts and patient folders, each with a unique number, should be prepared and maintained in readiness. Each folder should include a triage/ admission form, a fluid balance chart, and laboratory and X-ray request forms. WAR SURGERY"}
{"text": "\n## 9.9\n\n \n## Infrastructure\n\n Plans must be made to ensure adequate supplies of water, sufficient electricity, proper sanitation, and the disposal of waste. This may include special reserves of fuel for electric generators. Spare parts are also important to keep in stock; things tend to The designation of roles, responsibilities and tasks is not limited to the medical personnel. Technicians and maintenance workers to run the generators and ensure the water supply must be put on a special shift system so as to be available at all times. Hospital personnel, patients and their relatives, and volunteers must all eat. Hospital linen must be washed and theatre linen re-sterilized. The kitchen, cafeteria and laundry staff and facilities must all be included in the disaster plan. Relatives are a great nuisance in the triage area but their energies can be harnessed for the general good. They may be directed to give blood and engaged as volunteer stretcher- bearers, carriers of water, cleaners and kitchen staff, etc."}
{"text": "\n## 9.11 Training\n\n The hospital team should regularly practise different triage scenarios, on its own and as part of any national disaster or conflict-preparedness plan. Volunteers from the National Red Cross or Red Crescent Society, and their first aiders, may be mobilized to work in the hospital and/or play the role of the injured. Clinical protocols and guidelines for triage and patient management must be standardized and understood by all doctors and nurses. This helps to avoid confusion  and disagreements under tense and tiring circumstances. After every triage incident and when feasible, a general meeting of the staff should be held to discuss what went well and what went wrong. This evaluation permits the fine-tuning of the triage plan, to improve it for the next mass influx. Some individuals or even the whole team may have found the experience very stressful. An open, frank discussion about what happened and why certain decisions were made can be very beneficial, and even therapeutic."}
{"text": "\n## 9.12  Communication\n\n If the hospital is part of an integrated health system, then a means of coordination and communication with other health facilities may make it possible to transfer the wounded from the overwhelmed hospital to another which has received comparatively few patients. Alternatively, other health facilities may be able to  provide help in the form of additional personnel. The plan should include the means to contact staff who are off duty, bearing in mind that if combat is occurring in the area, hospital personnel may have difficulty in getting to work. Mobile telephone systems tend to stop functioning (or are stopped by certain authorities) during urban fighting or troubles. In an age of immediate mass communication contact with the media is inevitable, and what is happening in the hospital can be easily exploited for political purposes. The patients, hospital and staff are all protected under IHL. Obviously, military and governmental civilian hospitals are not “politically” neutral and cannot be expected to be. However, hospital personnel must act and speak publicly in accordance with their \"medical\" neutrality and impartiality. An \"official spokesperson\" for the hospital should be duly selected. HOSPITAL TRIAGE OF MASS CASUALTIES"}
{"text": "\n## Security 9.13\n\n Last, but certainly not least, is the safety and security of the hospital premises, patients and staff. When armed conflict results in mass casualties every wounded person transported to the hospital is accompanied, as a general rule, by two to four friends, relatives, comrades-in-arms, or bystanders who have helped in the evacuation or transport. Curious onlookers may try to enter the hospital as well. The civilian population may be in a state of panic and consider the hospital a safe place. This well-known phenomenon is called the \"convergence reaction\". People's fear and excitement add to the confusion and danger, especially if many in the crowd happen to be armed. Limiting the number of people entering the hospital reduces the confusion considerably. One major factor which creates the convergence reaction and confusion is the lack of proper pre-hospital triage, as is often seen in an urban context. As mentioned in Chapter 7, the waves of ambulances transporting casualties evacuate the dead and badly mutilated first, the superficially injured, who are shouting to call attention to themselves, second, and the seriously wounded who require emergency surgery last. Security must be ensured by having guards posted at the gate of the hospital. Only wounded persons, possibly accompanied by a close relative according to local cultural traditions, should be allowed to enter. All weapons must be left outside the gate. Access to the triage area should be blocked off, and a guard posted here as well to keep other patients and onlookers from mingling with new casualties. The large numbers of relatives and friends who inevitably rush to the hospital must be prevented from crowding the premises and impeding the work of the medical staff. A system for well-regulated visits by patients’ friends and relatives must be set up to reduce the possibility of “friction” occurring. Under certain circumstances, board and lodging close to the hospital compound must also be organized and provided. Whether the guards are armed or not will depend on the circumstances of the country concerned. IHL does not prohibit armed guards if their purpose is to maintain order and protect patients and personnel. In extreme circumstances, the hospital can organize a “security lock” 4 at the hospital or triage area entrance. This forced channel allows for better crowd control, especially of armed men."}
{"text": "\n## ICRC EXPERIENCE\n\n The ICRC hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, used commercial, steel containers with doors cut into the ends at the hospital entrance in 1992 to create a “tunnel” that allowed the filtering of all who entered. The width of the door was calculated to allow for the passage of a carried stretcher only. The ICRC – Somali Red Crescent Hospital in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1992 was located in a converted prison. A first set of guarded gates led to a triage area with a large tent. A second set of gates separated the triage tent from the hospital  compound itself, permitting controlled entry to the hospital. The ICRC hospital team working in the JFK Memorial Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, in 2003 set up a so-called \"triage tent\" just outside the fence and gate entrance  to the hospital. No medical triage was actually performed there, it was more of a “disarmament tent”. The tent provided a space for disarming any combatants, stripping the wounded of their soiled clothing, weapons and ammunition, and performing basic first aid. The wounded were then carried into the triage Monrovia \"triage tent\" in front of the hospital. Figure 9.7.2 \"Triage tent\" seen from the outside. Figure 9.7.3 Volunteers inside \"triage tent\" before the action. Volunteers after the action. A lock is a short section of a canal with gates at each end which can be opened or closed to change the water level, used for raising and lowering boats going through the canal. This permits control of the movement between areas at different water levels. By analogy, a security lock permits the control of people's movements between different hospital areas.

{"text": "\n## Introduction 10.1\n\n There are many factors that determine the final outcome of the management of war- wounded patients: • the actual injury – the clinical significance of the wound is a function of the severity of tissue damage and the anatomic structures involved i.e. size and site; • the general condition of the patient – nutritional status, dehydration, concomitant diseases, host resistance, etc. ; • pre-hospital care: protection, shelter, first aid, triage, evacuation time; • resuscitation, especially in the presence of haemorrhagic shock; • hospital triage; • surgery; • post-operative nursing care; • physiotherapy and rehabilitation. However, the single most important act that the surgeon performs for the great majority of casualties is wound excision or debridement. 1 The basic principles of trauma wound management have been known for a considerable period of time. Ibn Sinna commented on this (Figure 10.1), as did Alexander Fleming one thousand years later. “The severity of these [war] wound infections is merely the result of the very extensive destruction of the tissues by the projectile, thus furnishing an admirable culture medium for the bacteria out of reach of the natural  protective forces of the body, and if it were possible for the  surgeon to remove completely this dead tissue I am quite sure the infections would sink into insignificance.\" Alexander Fleming 1 Often, ICRC health personnel have witnessed inexperienced medical staff in a low- income country dealing with severely war-wounded patients for the first time. Their initial reaction is to try to stop the bleeding by “closing the holes”. If suture material is available, they stitch the wounds shut without excising dead tissue; if not, they plug the wounds with gauze compresses. Soon, infection develops. This is treated by a frequent change of dressing and antibiotic anarchy, wasting already insufficient hospital supplies. The end of the story may be a slow recovery with a major disability, or, more frequently, major complications often leading to the death of the patient accompanied by a deep sense of frustration among the medical staff. The basic management of war wounds is an art based on sound scientific principles. A good knowledge of wound ballistics helps the surgeon assess more accurately the extent of tissue damage and of the necessary surgery; it will not explain every wound or prescribe specific treatment for every patient. In only a few cases will knowledge of the specific causative weapon be of any clinical use. Wound ballistics teaches us that the cavitation effect of projectiles conveys pathogenic organisms, pieces of dirty skin and clothing and dust into the depths of  the wound. Anti-personnel blast mines drive pieces of the shoe or bones of the foot, \"Débridement\" is a French term originally used to mean the removal of a constriction, or to unbridle, and thus to promote drainage and relieve tension by incision. The English word \"excision\" means to cut away or cut out. A confusion of terminology occurred at the Inter-Allied Surgical Conference for the Study of War Wounds held in Paris in 1917, and the historic French expression came to mean a wound excision – the removal of dead tissue – for English-speaking surgeons. A further misunderstanding may be caused by the fact that excision, when used with reference to cancer surgery, tends to mean \"excision en bloc\" with a wide margin of healthy, surrounding tissue. In this book, the expressions \"excision\" and \"debridement\" are used interchangeably and are understood to mean the cutting away of dead or devitalized tissue. lbn Sinna – Avicenna (980 – 1036 CE), Persian physician and philosopher, author of Qanun fi al-Tib (The Laws of Medicine) Alexander Fleming (1881 – 1955), British physician, discoverer of penicillin.

Although the wounds are contaminated, infection does not set in for the first 6 – 8 hours. Ideally, therefore, war wounds should be debrided within six hours; this is not often the case. War wounds are dirty and contaminated, from the moment of injury. Whatever the weapon, a thorough examination of the patient and the wound(s) is essential. Examine the patient: • initial examination and resuscitation; • complete examination to identify all open wounds and any closed injuries. Examine the wounds and damaged organs: • to operate or not to operate; • to establish priorities if more than one surgical procedure is required; • to plan the operation. The treatment of mismanaged and neglected wounds is dealt with in Chapter 12. Exit woun Figure 10.4 Entry and exit thoraco-abdominal wounds: think anatomy!"}
{"text": "\n##  Complete examination 10.2\n\n All wounds involve soft tissues, and many of them will be complicated by damage to other structures. War wounds are often multiple and the pathology often multiple: a bomb explosion can simultaneously cause primary blast injury, penetrating metallic fragments, blunt trauma and burns. Close and complete examination of the patient is important to determine the site and size of all wounds present, in order to determine which wounds require surgery and to best plan the sequence As mentioned in Chapter 8 the surgeon should try to identify the path of any projectile. The wound may perforate the body part through-and-through, or the projectile may be retained without an exit. Entry and exit wounds may be at the same or different levels. The surgeon should visualize the anatomic structures that lie along the probable projectile trajectory, which may include a vital cavity: brain, thorax, or abdomen. The surgeon must think “anatomy”. The examination may reveal a tense, tender swelling in a through-and-through wound to the calf, which indicates haematoma and severe muscle damage; by contrast, the same exit and entry wounds with soft and relaxed tissues signify minimum injury. The surgeon must think “pathology”. Fractures and peripheral vascular and nerve damage should be identified. If there has been delay in evacuation, a bruit or vascular murmur may be heard and a \"thrill\" felt, signifying a pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula. Peripheral motor function and sensation are tested. Neurapraxia is more common than a severed nerve. Most wounds involving vital organs should already have been identified during the initial examination for airway, breathing and circulation. Nonetheless, the full- body palpation of a complete examination may reveal the small entry wound of a tiny fragment that has penetrated the meninges, pleura or peritoneum without immediately affecting the vital functions. A full assessment may require X-rays as well – with the exception of through-and- through soft-tissue wounds, which do not require them. One body region above and below any entry or exit wound should be filmed. Deformation or fragmentation of a SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF WAR WOUNDS bullet, showing the characteristic “shower of lead particles”, is a good indication of severe tissue damage. (Figures 10.5, 3.35 and 4.5). Many foreign materials, it should be noted, are not radio-opaque: pieces of shoe or clothing, mud, leaves and grass, plastic fragments from some landmines, for instance. On the other hand, it may be difficult to differenciate a projectile from the normal radio-opacity of some anatomic features (Figures 8.4.2 and 14.9.1). Major bone comminution also implies severe soft-tissue damage. Having radiography helps, but is not an absolute necessity for Note that the presence of air in tissues on X-ray does not necessarily mean the gas of clostridial myositis. The temporary cavity associated with high velocity missiles often leaves behind palpable and radiographic intrafascial and intramuscular air in healthy tissue some distance from the wound. This usually indicates severe tissue damage. The diagnosis of gas gangrene is a clinical one and the radiograph is not pathognomonic: vide Figures 10.6 and 13.2. More sophisticated diagnostic means can be used, of course, depending on the equipment and professional expertise of the hospital in question."}
{"text": "\n## 10.3 Preparation of the patient\n\n Not only are war wounds dirty and contaminated but battlefields are dirty places as well. The wounded do not have access to basic sanitary facilities and every precaution should be taken to meet fundamental hygiene standards. The majority of casualties have wounds to the limbs and are haemodynamically stable. All stable patients should be put through a warm shower upon admission; dressings are changed as necessary for examination and triage. Only critical cases go straight to the operating theatre. In the operating theatre, the surgeon should prepare the patient's position – in coordination with the anaesthetist and nursing staff – for the sequence of the operation before starting. A pneumatic tourniquet is very useful for limb wounds, especially before removal of a field dressing on an obviously serious injury. In the case of multiple soft-tissue wounds, those on the posterior aspect of the trunk and limbs should be dealt with before those on the anterior aspect, unless there is clinical evidence of a vascular injury. Many wounds to the back have been \"forgotten\" after much work on anteriorly situated wounds, and it is easier for the anaesthetist to finish off the operation with the patient supine. Under anaesthesia, dressings and splints are carefully removed. The skin over a large surrounding area, including the whole circumference of the limb or torso, is cleansed with soap and water and a brush, shaved, dried, and then painted with povidone iodine. The wound is irrigated copiously. Sterile sheets are put in place. Drapes with holes should only be used for the smallest and most superficial wounds. Most wounds will have to be extended and the operative field enlarged as a result. The wound is then thoroughly irrigated again to remove surface dirt and debris.

{"text": "\n## The best instrument for wound exploration is the surgeon’s (protected) finger.\n\n The surgical work required to treat a wound depends on its site and size: i.e. the location and amount of tissue damage. Knowledge of ballistics allows only for an understanding of wounding possibilities, but knowing that certain weapons have greater wounding potential does not help the surgeon in this assessment. With the exception of anti-personnel blast mines, even knowing which weapon was used is often of no practical use. Many wounds are the result of full metal jacket bullets that ricochet, creating large injuries similar to a dum-dum bullet (see Chapter 3). The most significant component of tissue damage is the permanent wound cavity, yet energy loss by the projectile and tissue disruption along the track is not uniform, resulting in a “mosaic of tissue damage”. Injury can also occur well beyond this, owing to stretch and shear during temporary cavitation: late ischaemic necrosis in the wall of hollow organs; or intimal detachment and vascular thrombosis of vessels that still look intact from the outside. The time between injury and treatment and the possible beginning of sepsis, must also be taken into account."}

It is important neither to under-treat – causing sepsis and even death – nor to over-treat – resulting in excess loss of normal tissue and increased disability. This art does have a scientific basis, nonetheless. The Red Cross Wound Score classifies penetrating weapon wounds into different categories according to the degree of tissue damage (Grade) and the structures injured (Type). This Score helps determine the extent of surgery necessary. Careful examination is important because not all wounds require surgical excision."}
{"text": "\n## 10.5  Surgical treatment\n\n The surgical treatment of a major wound is performed in two stages: • wound debridement , leaving the lesion wide open, without any suturing of skin or deep structures; • delayed primary closure 4 – 5 days later. The surgical treatment of most war wounds is a staged process involving two main procedures, the first being wound debridement or excision. The resulting wound is left unsutured. The open wound then undergoes delayed primary closure (DPC) after 4 – 7 days, once the exudative phase of trauma inflammation has subsided and the proliferative phase begun. In practice, DPC is usually performed after 4 – 5 days. Closure may be by simple direct suture or require sophisticated techniques of grafting and reconstruction (see Chapter 11).

{"text": "\n## 10.5.1   Technique of wound debridement\n\n Basic principles of wound debridement Stop haemorrhage. 1. Make adequate skin incisions and fasciotomies. 2. Remove dead and severely contaminated tissues to prevent/control 3. infection. Leave the wound open – unsutured. 4. Re-establish physiological function. 5. Handle gently and treat the tissues with respect, as always. 6. Control of haemorrhage is the first priority. In a large wound with heavy bleeding, blind clamping in the depths of a blood-filled cavity is mentioned only to be condemned. Direct local pressure should be exerted while proximal and distal control of the vessels by standard surgical exposure is performed. For management of vascular injuries, see Volume 2. After haemorrhage, the greatest danger to the patient is sepsis. Surgical infection requires a culture medium, which in the case of weapon wounds is a mixture of dead muscle, haematoma, bone fragments, dirty skin, foreign material (pieces of cloth or shoe, mud, gravel, leaves, dust, the missile, etc.), and, at times, extrinsic bone (bone fragments which come from the wound in another part of the body or another person and whose penetration, as secondary missiles, then creates a new wound). Injury caused by extrinsic bone fragments is seen with bomb explosions and APM. Wound debridement is the process whereby this dead and damaged tissue, grossly contaminated with bacteria and debris, is completely cut away. This leaves an area of healthy tissue with a good blood supply and capable of combating residual surface contamination, provided the wound is not closed. Excess excision of healthy tissue, however, will increase the potential for deformity and disability. Good vascularisation and oxygenation of the wound requires relief of tension within the wound and good drainage of the inflammatory exudate. This is provided by adequate incision of the skin and fascia, and leaving the wound unsutured."}
{"text": "\n## Wound debridement involves incision and excision.\n\n A basic instrument set is all that is needed in the vast majority of cases: scalpel, Metzenbaum (tissue) and Mayo (suture) scissors, toothed dissection forceps, non- toothed anatomic forceps, bone curette, six haemostats, and retractors. Diathermy is For the young surgeon, or one without experience of war wounds, it is best to excise the wound layer-by-anatomic-layer, proceeding from superficial tissues to deeper ones in order to best visualize the anatomy and pathology.

Only skin that is grossly pulped should be cut away. Usually no more than 2 – 3 mm of the skin edge need be removed at both entry and exit sites. This is followed by as generous an incision as necessary of healthy skin in order to gain access to the depths of the wound (Figure 10.9.2). Small entry and exit wounds may hide considerable internal injury. The most common error is to attempt to make a wound excision through a small entry or exit wound. In limbs, the incision should be made in the longitudinal axis, but not over subcutaneous bone, and at flexion creases it should curve in the usual way. The commonest mistake is to attempt a wound excision through small entry or exit holes or to make incisions"}

Large amounts of damaged muscle may lie underneath a small hole in the fascia; therefore, the muscular compartment should be opened up by a large incision of the deep fascia parallel to the muscle fibres along the entire length of the skin incision (Figure 10.9.3). This essential step allows wide and deep retraction to expose the depths of the wound. It may be necessary to add transverse cuts to the deep fascia to improve access. Post-traumatic oedema of the wound can easily cause compartment syndrome, compromising the local circulation with resultant necrosis of the muscles. The fascial incision is left open to allow oedematous and congested muscle to swell without tension, so as to avoid interference with the blood supply and to promote drainage of the inflammatory exudate and haematoma."}

Consequently, it is not always necessary to “cut until it bleeds”. The surgeon must therefore take into account the time since wounding. • However, minimal excision is often followed by necrosis of the muscle when the wound is looked at several days later. What is irreversible is not always  immediately apparent. The wound evolves and these changes demonstrate the different stages in the \"life-history\" of the wound 5 and should be well understood by the surgeon. • The surgeon should also understand that shock or the use of a tourniquet can change the colour or the capacity of muscle to bleed and that contractility is affected by hypothermia and paralysing anaesthetic agents. The criteria of the 4 Cs are very subjective and a function of the surgeon’s experience, but are nonetheless the best clinical measure available. The colour and consistency – texture – of the muscle should be noted. To test for contractility, 2 cm³ lumps of muscle should be picked up and pinched with a forceps and, if they do not contract, excised using scissors or knife. Note if the cut edge of the muscle lump bleeds. Cutting away lumps larger than 2 cm³ may result in the inadvertent removal of healthy tissue. Meticulous technique is the key. 5 Pearson W.

Fragments of bone with no attachment to periosteum or muscle are already sequestrated and should be discarded, but any bone still attached should be retained. Exposed medullary bone should be curetted back to firm marrow. Any bone left in situ must be cleaned of dead muscle and foreign material, dirty bone ends are trimmed by a bone-nibbling forceps ( rongeur ). Bone defect is not important at this stage, the wound is of paramount importance, and every attempt should be made to avoid infection, whose development will only lead to greater bone loss. The danger of non-union from the removal of multiple bone fragments is overrated. Figure 10.10.1 Figure 10.10.2 Figure 10.10.3 Patient Y: wound track opened up.

ICRC practice is to use the simplest form of bone immobilization at the first debridement; this is usually a plaster of Paris (POP) posterior slab or some form of skeletal traction. Seldom is external fixation required at this stage and internal fixation is proscribed in ICRC practice. More definitive bone immobilization is decided during delayed primary closure of the wound.

The surgeon should pay particular attention to the possibility of a vascular injury near severely comminuted fractures with multiple fragments. All nerves must be preserved as far as possible. Large nerves are resistant to section, although they may suffer neurapraxia. They are often the only structure left traversing a wound cavity. If they are found to be damaged, the site and degree of damage should be recorded. A non-absorbable suture may be placed in the proximal and distal ends and pulled together to facilitate their identification at a future operation. Exploration of the implicated nerve should be attempted during wound debridement only if it does not involve opening up healthy tissue planes. Tendons should be trimmed and only grossly destroyed fibres removed. Severed tendons, if important and requiring later repair, should be marked with a non- absorbable suture as with nerves. SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF WAR WOUNDS No attempt should be made at primary tendon or nerve repair, as success is unlikely in these grossly contaminated wounds. The failure of immediate repair will only make subsequent efforts that much more difficult. Also, repairs take time and energy at the “wrong time of the day”; they are best dealt with as planned elective procedures. Nerves and tendons should nonetheless be protected from extended exposure, by covering them with muscle or skin flaps or wet dressings.

{"text": "\n## Retained bullets and fragments 10.6\n\n Obviously, if the surgeon comes across a projectile during wound debridement then it should be removed, but healthy tissue should not be dissected in an attempt to find one. Otherwise, there are two conditions that require immediate removal of bullets and fragments, and these are related to specific proven risks and complications. 1. Projectile situated in a synovial joint – the piece of metal will cause pain, disability and progressive destruction of the joint cartilage though a mechanical action, and possible toxicity if made of lead: it should be removed as part of the wound debridement of the acute injury (Figures 10.11.1 and 10.11.2). 2. Risk that the projectile may cause erosion of an important structure (usually a major blood vessel) with the possibility of major haemorrhage or embolization (Figures 10.12.1 and 10.12.2). Should the surgeon suspect a pseudoaneurysm or an arterio-venous fistula then an operation to treat these pathologies involves the removal of the foreign body. Whether this removal is performed as an acute or planned elective procedure will depend on the exact anatomic location and endangered structure, the haemodynamic stability of the patient, the availability of diagnostic and operative equipment, and especially the expertise of the surgeon . The risks of a major procedure (removal of a bullet in the mediastinum, brain, etc.) whose morbidity may be quite high (especially in inexperienced hands) must be weighed against the benefits where the overall incidence of complications is low: for further indications and details, see Chapter 14.

{"text": "\n## Final look and haemostasis 10.7\n\n The edges of the wound should be retracted and blood clot, dirt and missile fragments removed from the sides and depths. Gentle and copious irrigation under low pressure, preferably with normal saline at this point, will wash out any residual debris and clot and dilute any bacterial load. A plastic bottle with holes cut into the top squeezed manually with both hands provides sufficient pressure; depending on the size of the wound cavity, one to three litres of saline is used. Very large and complicated fractures may require more until the wound “looks” clean. All the structures in the wound cavity should now be visualized and identified  (Figure 10.13). The surgeon should carefully explore the wound with the finger to identify any foreign bodies or unexpected extensions of the wound. • Do not open fresh planes in healthy tissue. • Do not explore unnecessarily for metallic fragments. • Remove fragments of clothing, in-driven dirt and vegetation. After removal of the pneumatic tourniquet, bleeding should be controlled by pressure with gauze and by fine absorbable ligatures. Electric cautery (diathermy) is best avoided as it leaves dead burnt tissue behind, which is more harmful than the foreign body of an absorbable knot. The wound should be left wide open (Figure 10.14). There is no use in \"putting in a few sutures” to partially close the wound, “just to bring the edges together a bit”. This will defeat the purpose of allowing for extensive wound decompression and drainage and, after the development of reactive oedema, a loose stitch becomes tight. In addition, although the wound may look clean, it is not sterile. Bacteria and microscopic debris still exist in the wound and will only be expelled with the post-traumatic inflammatory exudate if drainage is adequate. Should a drain be put in place? If the wound is relatively shallow and left wide open, there is no need for a drain. If there are deep pockets in the wound, which cannot be fully opened up because of anatomical constraints, then a soft penrose or corrugated rubber drain may be required. Counter-drainage through a stab wound in a dependent part might be more useful. These procedures are not new . They are the rules of all septic surgery to be found in all standard surgical reference texts. “Never close infected wounds. Do not close contaminated wounds or clean wounds that are more than 6 hours old. Systematically perform wound toilet and debridement and saline irrigation until the wound is  completely clean. Perform delayed primary closure as a second procedure.\""}

Some superficial Grade 1 soft-tissue wounds will require only simple local wound toilet. This will suffice with many low-energy small fragment wounds where the potential culture medium is so small that the body’s normal defence mechanisms can deal with it. They can be cleansed with soap, water, and a disinfectant and a simple dry dressing applied; the small wound is left open to heal by secondary intention. This is especially the case if antibiotics can be administered early (see Chapter 13). This ICRC experience has been confirmed by others. 6 Excision of entry and exit wounds under local anaesthesia may be necessary to promote free drainage in other superficial Grade 1 wounds. This may be accompanied by syringe injection of normal saline for irrigation of the wound track with/without a drain. Some such wounds, however, will require a full surgical exploration and excision, particularly in the one well-known instance where the type of weapon is of utmost importance: anti-personnel blast mines. Even small puncture wounds from landmines can be loaded with mud and grass or the mine casing, all of which must be removed (Figure 10.16).

{"text": "\n## 10.8.2   Serial debridement\n\n For some large wounds the line of demarcation between dead tissue and damaged, but viable, tissue is not clear. The life-history of a wound is such that apparently clean and living tissue may become necrotic after a few days, especially if there has been a delay between injury and debridement; and if the surgeon is not experienced in this type of surgery. The idea here is to debride obviously dead tissue; otherwise excise conservatively, and then re-examine the wound in theatre after 48 hours. This method is called a \"serial debridement\", i.e. a wound excision over several sessions,  and it should be planned as such. The surgeon should make a conscious decision that, \"in this patient, because I am not certain of the viability of the remaining tissues and  excessive excision of normal tissue would cause deformity or compromise function, l shall perform a second debridement later\" (Figure 10.17). In armies with very efficient means of evacuation and sufficient human resources, serial debridement may be the preferred method of treatment and takes place at different hospitals with different operating surgeons along the chain of casualty care. Serial debridement cannot be considered a standard method of treatment in a situation of mass casualties and poor or no evacuation capacity. It requires sufficient personnel and resources to handle the number of wounded and to allow for a second look and follow-up. More often, the surgical workload is so great, or the tactical situation such, that serial debridement is not possible. The surgeon must treat each wound excision as a definitive one. In this instance, if in doubt about tissue viability, it is wiser to excise. Figure 10.15.1 Superficial \"peppering\" by grenade fragments.

Only in the presence of severe contamination, or if in doubt, might it be wiser to leave these wounds open. In maxillo-facial wounds, the oral mucosa is an exception in all respects and every attempt should be made to close it primarily. Machete or panga wounds, especially to the face or scalp, are not incised wounds, but rather a mixture of crush and laceration. Dirty connecting tissue is found to underlie an overhanging edge of skin and galea aponeurotica. If less than 6 hours since wounding, immediate primary closure, after full debridement, with a subcutaneous drain is permissible. If more than 6 hours old, it is better to leave the wound open for delayed primary closure after 2 – 4 days. In penetrating brain injury, it is best to close the dura.

Each dressing change constitutes trauma to the healing granulation tissue and exposes it to cross-infection. A good look at the patient instead will suffice: the wound is doing quite well if the patient is smiling, eating, and sitting comfortably in bed.

This should not be underestimated in the context of a poor, war-ravaged country. In all cases where there is an extensive soft-tissue wound, even in the absence of a fracture, the entire limb should be immobilized to provide rest. This can be achieved The normal catabolic response to trauma must be overcome and patients offered a good nutritious diet. In a poor country, many wounded patients will arrive at hospital suffering from malnutrition. This will only compromise the body’s ability to heal and resist infection.

The muscle is adherent to the gauze and, as the dressing is gently peeled away, the muscle contracts and bleeds slightly. The surface is a bright red and oozes blood. This wound is ready for DPC.

If the wound is infected, the dressing slides off with no resistance whatsoever because there is a film of pus between it and the wound surface, which may contain areas of necrotic tissue as well as pus. The surface is a dull- or greyish-red and does not bleed. The dressing gives off the “bad-bad smell” of wound sepsis. Such an infected wound, or one containing residual contamination or devitalized tissue, requires further surgical excision – redebridement – and is then left open again. Closure is postponed. This failed attempt at DPC is not to be confused with “serial debridement” (see Chapter 10)."}
{"text": "\n## 1.1.1   Methods of delayed primary closure\n\n This is usually accomplished by direct suture: simple approximation of the deep structures and skin with minimal mobilization of the skin edges, and without tension (Figure 11.2). If there is tension in the suture line, the skin edges will become necrotic and the wound will break down. Small wounds may be closed using adhesive tape to approximate the edges."}
{"text": "\n## The wound should not be closed under tension.\n\n Significant tissue loss prevents approximation of the deep structures and skin. Rotation skin flaps might be useful in some anatomic locations. If bone is exposed, a musculocutaneous flap may be necessary. Larger areas require skin grafting (Figure 11.1.5)."}
{"text": "\n##  Adequate primary surgical excision is vital for  uncomplicated wound closure by DPC.\n\n \n## 11.1.2   Dead space\n\n As with all wounds, the obliteration of dead space is an accepted principle of DPC management. This may be technically difficult when there has been extensive loss of deep tissue. Absorbable sutures are used to approximate deep structures, but, here again, undue tension should be avoided as it will only result in local tissue ischaemia that decreases local resistance to the development of infection and impedes healing. lt is not necessary to suture fascia or subcutaneous tissues. Drains should be avoided whenever possible in DPC. Drains may act as retrograde conduits for skin bacterial flora and contaminants to gain entrance into the wound, and they impair the resistance of tissue to infection; a drain constitutes an additional foreign body in the wound. Drains should never be placed in wounds without dead space; they should only be used for those with significant dead space and where there is associated oozing of blood. Within 24 hours, the oozing has usually stopped and the drain should be removed. If used, a drain should be placed dependently and, if possible, be of the suction catheter variety. Otherwise, a simple soft penrose drain will suffice."}
{"text": "\n##  Avoid drains whenever possible in DPC. If used, remove within 24 hours.\n\n After DPC, the wound should be covered with some layers of dry gauze which can be left until the time of suture removal. If signs of infection develop after closure, the patient is taken back to theatre where the wound is inspected, sutures removed, and the wound re-opened for drainage and redebridement if necessary. Avoid performing this procedure in the ward, where proper inspection and drainage are difficult, as it only favours the development of cross-infection. DELAYED PRIMARY CLOSURE AND SKIN GRAFTING"}
{"text": "\n## Skin grafting 11.2\n\n  If the wound cannot be closed by direct suture or rotational flaps because of skin loss, a skin graft can be applied, sometimes combined with partial direct suture. Free skin grafts may be partial-thickness (epidermis and part of the dermis) or full- thickness (including all the dermis). Partial-thickness grafts, also called split-skin grafts (SSG), vary in thickness depending upon how much of the dermis is incorporated. The thicker the graft, the less it will contract and the more it will resemble normal skin in colour and texture; but the risk of the graft failing is greater. Conversely, thinner grafts are hardy and take more readily, but contract and distort more than thick ones and have a poorer functional and aesthetic result."}
{"text": "\n## Thin partial-thickness grafts\n\n These are used for large areas and when the development of a contracture or quality of skin cover is not important.

However, the recipient area must be very healthy with good vascularity. Full-thickness grafts These are best for a good cosmetic result in the face, or to cover a sensitive functional"}
{"text": "\n## 1.2.2 Requisites for skin grafting\n\n Skin grafts can cover any wound with enough vascularity to produce granulation tissue. This does not imply that fully mature granulation tissue must be present prior to skin grafting, and early grafting for DPC, when the wound is first opened on the fifth day post-debridement, is often used (Figure 11.1.5). Early SSG has advantages and disadvantages: the wound is closed preventing any infection from developing, which is particularly important in large wounds; but the quality of resultant skin is less and there is greater tissue fibrosis and contraction. Most full-thickness grafts are also performed early. On the other hand, a deep wound, or one over a flexion crease, may be dressed while waiting for more granulation-tissue to grow in, and then grafted at a later date. However, excessive granulation tissue should be scraped clear prior to graft application. A limb with a wound over a flexion crease should be splinted in the extension position with a plaster back slab to avoid contracture while waiting for closure. Tissues which cannot take skin grafts include avascular areas, such as hyaline cartilage, exposed tendon without paratenon, and exposed bone cortex without periosteum. These cases will require some form of skin or musculocutaneous flap for closure. In the case of exposed bone cortex, an alternative may be the drilling of multiple small holes in the cortex to let granulation tissue grow through from the inner cancellous bone. Split-skin grafts (thin and thick) are taken from an area which can produce a broad area of skin. The common donor sites are the thighs, back, and arms and forearms (Figure 11.3). Figure 11.3 Figure 11.3 Donor sites for partial-thickness grafts. WAR SURGERY Figure 11.4 A dermatome: various models, with disposable blades, are available – the thickness of the split skin graft harvested is controlled by the screw at the right end of the instrument; the setting is then locked using the screw at the left end. Split-skin grafts should be taken using a dermatome, such as a Humby knife (Figure 11.4). A free hand knife, such as a De Silva knife which incorporates a razor blade, or scalpel, can be used if a dermatome is not available or if the area to be harvested is small. The principles for the use of all hand knives are the same. The blades are disposable and are fitted into the knife. A calibration control is adjusted to set the depth of split skin required. Once this has been adjusted, a locking nut is tightened at the opposite end of the knife. It is important to check the gap between the blade and the knife before use, by holding the instrument to the light and visually checking the gap. The gap should be even throughout its length. Electric and pneumatic knives are also available but are not standard in ICRC practice."}
{"text": "\n## The gap between the knife and the blade must be visually  checked before use.\n\n \n## Harvesting the SSG\n\n The area of skin to be removed is washed with soap and water and shaved if necessary; povidone iodine is applied. Intradermal saline or, better still, dilute adrenaline solution (1:500,00), is injected into the donor area prior to cutting, to facilitate harvesting and diminish local blood loss. The donor site, the cutting edge of the knife, and the edge of a skin board are greased with vaseline-gauze. An assistant applies an ungreased skin board to the distal end of the donor site and pulls in such a fashion as to tense the skin tight. The assistant’s other hand grasps the underside of the donor site (thigh or arm) to flatten the area from which the graft is being taken (Figure 11.5.1). Figure 11.5.1 Figure 11.5.2 Harvesting a split skin graft from the medial side of the thigh – note the assistant’s left hand flattening the donor site by exerting upward pressure on the undersurface of the thigh. Surgeon's wooden board applying counter-traction. The surgeon places the greased board about 4 – 5 cm in front of the ungreased board, and exerts counter traction to increase the skin tension (Figure 11.5.2). The knife goes into the gap between the two boards at an angle of 30° and even, gentle, side-to-side cutting movements of about 2 cm are made. Continuous movement of the knife is essential. The surgeon advances the greased board proximally while exerting minimal effort to advance the knife. The tendency is to cut too quickly, or exert too much pressure at too high an angle; the blade will not shave the skin off but cut deeply into the subcutaneous tissue. When the desired amount of skin has been raised, the wrist is supinated and the knife cuts through. The harvested skin is now placed on a saline-soaked gauze swab, undersurface upwards, and stored until applied to the recipient area. DELAYED PRIMARY CLOSURE AND SKIN GRAFTING"}
{"text": "\n## 1.2.4 Reverdin pinch grafts\n\n These can be used to cover large areas of defect and where the recipient area is unfavourable, such as muscles moving in different planes. A full take is not expected and the gaps between the grafts will fill in as the skin spreads outwards and coalesces. The cosmetic result is poor. As with SSG, an intradermal infiltration of local anaesthetic with adrenaline is injected into the donor area. This helps to avoid cutting the grafts too deeply and is often all the anaesthesia required. The grafts are cut using a scalpel blade and can vary in size up to about 2 cm² (Figure 11.6). The harvested skin is handled as described previously until it is applied to the recipient area."}
{"text": "\n## 1.2.5   Application of grafts and graft meshing\n\n The recipient bed is prepared by washing with saline and scraping clean any exuberant granulation tissue. Figure 11.7 Figure 11.7 Recipient site prepared to receive SSG. The harvested partial-thickness skin is laid across the recipient bed and cut so that it is slightly larger than the site. This allows for the cut undersurface to be in complete contact with the recipient bed and for later graft contraction. Often a graft is placed on a wound that is deeper than the thickness of the graft. In these cases the edge of the graft at the base of the wound must be carefully approximated to include the entire height of the defect. The graft should be meshed to allow for drainage of serum and blood; this is important to avoid the graft “floating” and provide for close contact between it and the recipient bed. Meshing is accomplished by placing the harvested skin on a surface, preferably the wooden board, undersurface facing upwards, and making numerous parallel incisions through the graft with a No. 15 scalpel blade. Optimally, the ratio of gaps to skin should be 3:1 thus allowing the SSG to cover an area three times its original size (Figure 11.8). Over a period of 10 – 14 days, the skin grows across the interstices and complete healing is obtained. Graft meshing is particularly useful in cases where there is insufficient autograft to completely cover raw areas, such as large wounds or burns (see Figure 11.1 for a clinical example). Mechanical meshing machines are available – and expensive – but are not standard ICRC equipment except in hospitals with a large number of patients suffering from burns. A good improvisation is a sharp circular pizza cutter, modified with notches ground into its circumference, and used to mesh skin against the wooden board. b Reverdin pinch grafts: a. The skin is picked up with a needle and round patches of thick SSG, 1 – 2 cm in diameter, are cut with a scalpel. b. If the patches are taken in a line, the area can be excised and the wound closed by primary suture. c. The patches are spread over the receptor site with gaps of a few millimetres between each piece. Figure 11.8 Meshing of a skin graft. WAR SURGERY Figure 11.9 SG sutured in place. Grafts can often be kept in place by a suitable dressing and elastic bandaging. If graft stability cannot be ensured by the covering dressing, it should be sutured in place (Figure 11.9). One technique is a continuous 3/0 non-absorbable suture run around the edge of the graft to provide adequate contact. Another is to use several anchor sutures about the circumference, left long and used as tie-overs across the dressing; especially useful for small grafts on hollow areas (Figure 11.11). The excess skin of the graft can either be trimmed once the graft has been sutured in place, or cut 10 – 14 Once the graft has been sutured or placed on the recipient bed, it should be covered with a sheet of vaseline-gauze followed by a gauze compress or cotton-wool pledgets soaked with saline. These dressings should be pressed into the concavities of the defect to ensure that there is complete apposition between the graft and the bed. The dressing should then be covered with a thick layer of cotton wool held in place by a crepe bandage. In case of consistent oozing from the recipient bed, consider delaying the application of the graft for 24 – 48 hours. The harvested skin can be stored for up to three weeks in an ordinary domestic refrigerator at 4° C without compromising the success rate. It is placed on a moist piece of gauze with the undersurface facing upwards and then put in a sterile jar containing normal saline. Jars should be stored with an airtight lid and carefully labelled with the patient's identification and the date of harvesting."}
{"text": "\n## Delayed application of split skin grafts is often  the preferred method.\n\n \n## 11.2.6   Graft take\n\n Grafts adhere initially by a thin layer of fibrin and are fed by \"plasmatic imbibition\" from the recipient bed granulation tissue until in-growth of capillaries occurs by about the fourth post-operative day. The new capillaries link with the graft and the fibrin clot is transformed into fibrous tissue. For these reasons, there are three major A vascular recipient bed which is free of pathogenic bacteria . Normal bacterial 1. flora will not necessarily interfere with graft survival.

{"text": "\n##  Grafts require careful nursing care.\n\n In ICRC practice, the graft is first inspected after 48 – 72 hours; the dressing is carefully removed using two pairs of tissue forceps: one holding the graft and keeping it applied to its bed, the other removing the dressing. Care must be taken not to tear away the graft. If the graft is healthy and adherent to the recipient base, another vaseline-gauze and compress are bandaged in place and no further dressing is necessary for another 10 days, until the time of stitch removal. If a haematoma or seroma is found, the fluid should be expressed through the meshed gaps using gentle pressure applied through the forceps and a pledget of soaked cotton-wool. Another firm dressing of vaseline-gauze is applied. These grafts are then inspected on a daily basis until firmly adherent to the recipient base. Any small pus collections should be debrided with scissors to prevent spread of infection. Intra-epidermolysis is a phenomenon where the outer layer of the graft is lost while viable epithelial cells remain at the base. Dark blisters can be seen and may be debrided but great care should be taken not to disturb underlying graft that may still be viable. On the other hand, any graft which is dead or floating on a \"sea of pus\" should be removed and the wound cleaned with normal saline. ( If Pseudomonas is the culprit – presence of bluish-green pus – a dilute vinegar solution is useful.) If the raw area of the wound is more than 2 x 2 square cm, it should be re-grafted when clean. If smaller, it can be left to heal by secondary intention. At ten days, a healthy graft should be firmly adherent and can be left exposed and submitted to a simple daily inspection."}
{"text": "\n## 1.2.8   Dressing of donor sites\n\n Split-thickness donor sites can bleed briskly, and in children can result in significant blood loss. As mentioned above, the donor site should be infiltrated intradermally with a 1:500,000 solution of adrenaline or a local anaesthetic with adrenaline to decrease bleeding. They can also be extremely painful, especially when dressings become firmly adherent. WAR SURGERY The following regimen minimizes discomfort and complications. 1. After harvesting the SSG, a dry dressing should be applied immediately, kept in place if necessary with an elastic bandage, and left alone while the graft is being applied; by which time haemostasis has usually been achieved. 2. The dressing should then be removed. If there is persistent bleeding, a compress wetted with the dilute adrenalin solution should be applied and direct pressure 3. Next, the donor site should be covered with a firm pressure dressing of vaseline- gauze, dry compresses and elastic bandage; it should be kept from falling down the limb by adhesive strapping. The dressings should be left in situ for 10 –14 days, unless there are signs of underlying infection.  A membrane dressing, such as Opsite ®, can be used if available. If fluid 4. accumulates beneath the membrane, it can be evacuated by pricking with a needle and pressing. The perforation site should be covered with a smaller piece of membrane. If the dressing falls off it can be reapplied. Generally, this stays in place for the desired period of about ten days."}

These grafts are used principally for the head and neck and hands and feet to provide thicker, better- Full-thickness grafts have a number of advantages apart from better texture and colour. They allow for the transfer of hair-bearing skin, as all the dermal adnexal structures are intact, and they contract less than split-skin grafts. The main disadvantages are a lower survival rate and their limited size. The recipient bed must be in optimal condition to take a full-thickness graft; haemostasis, in particular, must be perfect. There should be meticulous suturing and approximation between the graft and the recipient edge. Generally, a full-thickness graft is small because the plasma exudate of the recipient bed is barely sufficient to feed and oxygenate the graft, and capillaries from the recipient bed and edge and graft undersurface must grow in quickly to assure survival."}

The donor area should be injected with local anaesthetic with adrenaline and the edge of the recipient area with local anaesthetic without adrenaline; both are left for five minutes before incision. The full-thickness skin should then be excised exactly. The graft must be thoroughly defatted before application. This is best achieved by placing the moist graft, epidermis-side down, on the finger tip and scrupulously excising the fat using fine scissors. The graft is left unmeshed. The graft is then sutured in place immediately and meticulously. Several interrupted nylon sutures are inserted close to the edge and left long for tie-overs (Figure 11.11).

On the hands or over a flexion crease, once the graft has been sutured in position a bolus of dressing is fashioned with vaseline-gauze and moist cotton-wool pledgets to hold the graft closely in contact with the recipient bed. The tie-over sutures are brought together over the dressing, which should be snug, but not so tight as to strangle the graft. The dressing should be left in place for 7 – 10 days and then removed. At this point, in both light- or dark-skinned people, the graft may be any colour from pinkish or pinkish-white to bronze to black. Even a graft that has a blackish appearance on inspection can survive. No judgement on graft survival should be passed until a month from the time of application. WAR SURGERY"}
{"text": "\n## 1.4  Healing by secondary intention\n\n Some small wounds are difficult to suture without tension, or without very wide mobilization of skin flaps, because their surrounding edges are fibrotic. There is little benefit in another surgical operation, even skin-grafting. These wounds are best left to granulate and heal by secondary intention (Figure 12.10). A change of dressing and gentle washing with normal saline every 4 – 5 days is usually sufficient: every dressing is a trauma to a healing wound. Daily dressings are not necessary if the wound is dry. Some traditional local dressings (sugar, honey, etc.) have an antibacterial effect and promote the formation of granulation tissue and are useful if the wound is deep.

{"text": "\n## 12.1 General considerations\n\n As described in Chapter 10, in many war zones today, characterized by irregular bush warfare, rebellions and insurrections, neglected and mismanaged wounds are amongst the commonest injuries that the surgeon sees. First aid is not available, doctors and nurses are scarce, and health services have been disrupted by poverty and conflict. Distances are long and the terrain difficult with little in the way of organized transport. Many patients reaching hospital have wounds which were inflicted more than 24 hours earlier, and some have wounds that are many days, or even weeks, old. Even if injured patients reach hospital fairly quickly, the sheer number of casualties often exceeds the surgical capacity or expertise available. The result is an inordinate delay in their treatment or frank mismanagement."}
{"text": "\n## ICRC EXPERIENCE\n\n In the ICRC hospital of Lokichokio in northern Kenya serving the victims of the conflict in southern Sudan, 12,264 war-wounded patients were registered between 1991 and 2006 in the ICRC surgical database. Evacuation was by ICRC and United Nations airplanes and few, if any, received pre-hospital treatment of any sort. Of these patients, 84% reached the hospital more than 72 hours after injury. ICRC staff have seen similar conditions of delay in evacuation to a surgical facility in Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nepal and elsewhere, and have seen the same phenomenon with crush wounds after earthquakes in low-income countries. Before reaching a proper surgical hospital, some patients receive no treatment at all; others a cursory dressing, while yet others have undergone an inadequate wound excision. Some wounds will have been sutured, generally without any form of excision. All sutured wounds, no matter how clean they appear, must have their sutures removed and opened up for drainage. As mentioned previously, the simple rules of septic surgery apply. Never close infected or contaminated wounds primarily."}
{"text": "\n##  Remove all sutures from previously sutured wounds.\n\n After delay, some Grade 1 minor soft-tissue wounds are found to be healing spontaneously. Most wounds, however, will be inflamed or frankly infected with a degree of chronic sepsis, and some will be grossly putrefying. This is often seen in mismanaged wounds. Tetanus, gas gangrene, and invasive haemolytic streptococcal infection are ever present dangers (see Chapter 13). These wounds require aggressive excision.

{"text": "\n##  Surgical excision  12.3\n\n Surgical excision is a more difficult procedure in these neglected and mismanaged wounds. The line of demarcation between viable and non-viable tissue, especially in oedematous muscle and fascia, is less obvious, and the zone of post-traumatic inflammatory hyperaemia is compounded by that of infective inflammation and the presence of the biofilm. The extent of adequate excision is more difficult to assess since there is not only a \"mosaic\" of ballistic tissue damage in the permanent cavity itself but also that due to the septic process. Festering wounds that are days old have regions of infection mixed with regions of fibrous tissue healing. The wound often resembles a cavity filled with detached soft tissue, bone fragments or the ends of fractured long bones, foreign debris, and fibrous tissue, covered with a coat of pus (Figures 12.7.1 and 12.8.2). Access may be difficult because of areas of  wound contracture due to the tough fibrous tissue. The principles of surgery remain the same, however. The skin and deep fascia must be widely re-incised and the wound cavity laid open for proper visualization and drainage (drainage following the same principle as for a simple abscess). The excision is directed towards the removal of all non-viable and heavily contaminated tissue and foreign debris, and the physical disruption of the biofilm. NEGLECTED OR MISMANAGED WOUNDS Because surgical excision is more difficult in these wounds, there is a higher incidence of persistent infection. In such circumstances, several redebridements may become necessary. Depending on the experience of the surgeon, these are the patients who might most benefit from staged serial debridements. If present, all sutures must be removed and debridement performed as if no previous wound toilet had been done. All macroscopic contamination should be excised. Skin and subcutaneous fat must be cut back until they ooze blood. Grossly infected fascia is usually shredded and dull grey, while healthy fascia is a glistening white. The muscle compartments are in even greater need of decompression than those of a fresh wound. Contractility is the best indication of muscle viability. On the other hand, the surgeon must learn to distinguish between bleeding from small vessels in partially necrotic tissue, and capillary oozing from healthy but inflamed tissue. Experience brings an increase in the amount of tissue excised. Vessels and nerves should be left intact on the other hand, because they rarely turn septic. Operative blood loss is usually considerable because of the inflammatory oedema and hyperaemia. It is even more important not to open up healthy tissue planes in an attempt to remove any projectile. This will only help to spread the infection."}

Totally detached bone fragments are often trapped inside fibrous tissue and their localization and identification can be extremely difficult and frustrating. • A dead bone fragment is pearly white; living bone is dull greyish-white with red c capillary specks. • If scratched with a bone curette, dead bone will give off a high and hollow resonance; living bone sounds low and dull. • Another telltale sign can be observed when the bone fragment is grasped with forceps and a motion of pronation and supination imparted. If muscle or periosteum is holding the fragment in place, these structures will move with the pronation and supination. If the fragment is detached and held by fibrous tissue oly, the movement will break the fibrous adhesion and the bone fragment will cme free.

{"text": "\n## All detached bone fragments are sequestra.\n\n \n## 12.3.3 Irrigation\n\n The wound is now copiously irrigated and dressed as for routine surgical excision. The ICRC has tested irrigation with a high-pressure pulsatile lavage and daily showering of the open cavity in these neglected septic wounds. Although both techniques appeared to clear up the biofilm and afford a better assessment of tissue viability, the results were inconclusive. Both involve a great deal of time, effort, and nursing care, and are difficult to maintain if a large number of patients are under treatment with no possibility of transfer to other less overstretched facilities."}
{"text": "\n## Antibiotics 12.4\n\n Penicillin and metronidazole are given, according to the antibiotic protocol (see Chapter 13); and gentamycin is added if there are signs of active spreading inflammation. No topical antibiotics or antiseptics are used in ICRC practice. Bacterial culture should be done, if available. Good bacterial culture and sensitivity in a forward hospital is far more diffucult to accomplish than is usually realized. Note that clinical response does not always follow laboratory sensitivities, or lack thereof. Not only do “wild” bacteria not live in colonies, but in vitro sensitivity does not always reflect in vivo response, and the surface or discharge flora does not always represent the bacteria present inside the tissues. Nonetheless, the basic rules of septic surgery still apply. Infection requires good drainage – as with an abscess – and the elimination of the bacterial culture medium, i.e. the dead tissue. Antibiotics will only be effective once the biofilm has been disrupted and the bacteria made susceptible to their action.  Persistent or recurrent wound infection requires re-excision, not ward dressings. NEGLECTED OR MISMANAGED WOUNDS"}
{"text": "\n## 12.5 To close or not to close?\n\n The primary phase of wound healing begins at the moment of wounding. It is well established by the time of presentation if the wound is a few days old. Thus, several days after surgical excision, many wounds are past the time of healing by primary intention. There is already much fibrous tissue present (Figure 12.9.3) and even more by the time the wound is clean and ready for closure. If secondary suture is attempted there is usually considerable tension on the wound edges with a high incidence of ncrosis and breakdown. The majority of these wounds are unsuitable for delayed suture and require skin grafting or rotation skin flaps for closure; or, if small, should be left to granulate and heal by secondary intention (Figure 12.10)."}
{"text": "\n## Most delayed or neglected wounds will be unsuitable for delayed primary closure. \n\n It is in healing by secondary intention that several traditional local wound treatments may be of value, as mentioned in Chapter 11. ICRC surgeons and nursing staff have used dressings of honey or sugar, or hypertonic saline (add salt to normal saline until it no longer dissolves), which promote granulation tissue formation and have antibacterial properties. It must be emphasized that these topical treatments are an adjunct to, and not a replacement for, adequate surgery. Figure 12.10 Figure 12.10 Healing by secondary intention. Many patients with severe wound infection or frank putrefaction are malnourished, anaemic and dehydrated.

{"text": "\n## War wounds are dirty and contaminated from the moment of injury.\n\n Other contaminants found in war wounds include clothing fragments, dust, miscellaneous organic matter (mud, grass, leaves, etc.), and wood and glass splinters from bombed buildings. Studies in Korea and Viet Nam showed that different varieties of soil are associated with different organisms – which also vary according to weather and season – with varying likelihood of producing severe infection (mud and agricultural soil contaminated with animal or human excrement are apparently the worst). In addition, the chemical  composition of some soils can inactivate antibodies and impair leukocyte phagocytosis. Various home-made landmines have contained animal manure contaminant. lt is important, however, to distinguish between: • simple contamination of a wound; • local sepsis; and • invasive infection. In a contaminated wound, bacteria proliferate in dead tissues but no invasion of viable tissue takes place until the number of bacteria reaches a threshold of 10 6 /gram of tissue. The presence of crushed tissues, dirt, and other foreign materials lowers the threshold of infection and invasion, by providing an environment where bacteria can grow and replicate without the patient’s immune system being able to eliminate them. There are a number of microbe-related risk factors involved: virulence, production of enzymes and toxins, etc. The body attempts to wall off the mass of necrotic muscle and bacteria with a fibrin barrier. Without adequate drainage, this will form an abscess; with proper drainage the necrotic mass will be expelled after 10 days.' In both cases, the body’s natural defence mechanisms come into play to isolate the contaminants and the dead tissues. When the local defence mechanisms can no longer cope, invasive deep tissue and systemic infection occurs. Patient immunity and resistance can also be weakened by malnutrition and chronic disease, especially HIV/AIDS. The local defence mechanisms and general resistance constitute the host-related risk factors. Six hours appears to be the critical period after contamination. The efficacy of surgery and antibiotics to prevent infection decreases with time from injury, while the bacterial load increases exponentially. As with the differential grading of wounds according to the Red Cross Wound Score described in Chapter 4, a good understanding of the pathology involved is important in determining the proper and adequate procedure to follow, and the usefulness of antibiotics to supplement excision, drainage, and the body's natural resistance to infection. Uncomplicated soft-tissue Grade 1 wounds, as already explained in Section 10.8.1, can be treated with simple wound toilet; an antibiotic treatment helps if begun within 6 hours. Early administration of antibiotics in more severe wounds seems to inhibit bacterial growth and limit local invasion, at least temporarily. Any delay beyond six hours, however, greatly increases the risk of infection. 1 Fackler ML, Breteau JPL, Courbil LJ, Taxit R, Glas J, Fievet JP.

At the instant of wounding, there is polymicrobial contamination with particular risk from Clostridia and β-haemolytic streptococcus. Afterwards, self-contamination from skin and gastro-intestinal flora occurs; finally, hospital-acquired nosocomial bacteria may step in. This concept is essential to understanding the roles of hygiene and environmental control measures, adequate surgery, and the use of antibiotics: i.e. the operation- related risk factors. 3 The widespread availability of antibiotics – and their abuse – during the last fifty years has further complicated the bacteriology of wounds because of the hospital selection of resistant strains.

{"text": "\n## Myositis/deep tissue infection\n\n Bacteria spread into muscles and tissues further than the permanent cavity and the zone of contusion and invade the zone of concussion and beyond. Systemic symptoms become more pronounced and, with certain infections, come to dominate the clinical picture. Overwhelming infections usually present with the classical signs of sepsis (fever, tachycardia, etc.); but they may also present without these signs, particularly in immune-compromised patients (HIV/AIDS, chronic disease, malnutrition). In the past, deep-tissue infections were usually caused by Clostridia and invasive β-haemolytic streptococcus and accounted for the greatest amount of tissue damage, and the most severe systemic signs and symptoms. The availability of penicillin has radically changed this clinical picture. 4 Different types of invasive tissue infection have been described: • pyogenic deep tissue infection – this is usually a mixed infection, Gram-positive and -negative organisms, often including non-clostridial anaerobes; • gas gangrene: this infection is still seen in neglected and mismanaged wounds; • tetanus: poverty and the disorganizing effects of war disrupt immunization programmes in many countries – this infection is still, all too often, a major killer; • invasive streptococcal infection – also still seen in neglected and mismanaged wounds; • bone infection: when deep-tissue infection extends to sequestrated bone fragments chronic sepsis tends to develop with the production of a “biofilm” – this is often seen in neglected and mismanaged wounds (see Chapter 12); • necrotizing fasciitis, synergistic gangrene and anaerobic cellulitis.

{"text": "\n## 13.3.2   Gas gangrene\n\n Gas gangrene as a peculiar complication of wounds has been known since the time of Hippocrates. Its occurrence in war wounds throughout history as well as in other trauma has been widely described mainly because of its dramatic manifestations and very high associated mortality. Delay to surgery, as may occur during war or after a natural disaster with mass casualties, greatly increases the risk of gas gangrene. Gas gangrene is a rapidly-spreading oedematous myonecrosis occurring character- istically in severe wounds in muscles contaminated with pathogenic obligatory anaerobes, particularly Clostridium perfringens. Almost every case presents a mixed bacterial flora; aerobes use up available oxygen and promote the anaerobic environment required by Clostridia. In large muscle wounds there will always be areas of ischaemia and the potential for gas gangrene. But gas gangrene can also develop even when the trauma is not very severe. If the wound is deep, contains necrotic tissue, and is isolated from the surface, an anaerobic environment is formed and it is possible for a clostridial infection to become established. This deep anaerobic environment is seen particularly in wounds sutured closed without debridement. The presence of foreign material in wounds, especially soil, will increase the risk of developing gas gangrene. The prolonged application of tourniquets or tight plasters and fascial compartment syndrome also present high risks. The infection is more common in wounds to the lower limb and perineum than to the upper limb. The features of the disease result, first, from the local action of the organisms on muscle glucose, producing acid and gas, and on muscle protein, causing digestion. Second, the organisms produce soluble, very potent toxins, which diffuse into the tissues causing further tissue destruction and profound toxaemia. The muscle breakdown products are very toxic in their own right. The combination of breakdown products and specific toxins causes the relentless and profound toxaemia which, if untreated, will inevitably lead to death."}
{"text": "\n## Early and adequate surgery will prevent gas gangrene in war wounds.\n\n The incubation period of gas gangrene is usually short, almost always less than three days, and in the majority of cases less than 24 hours long; it may even be as short as 6 hours. Incubation periods of up to six weeks have occasionally occurred. Typically, gas gangrene manifests itself with the sudden appearance of increasing pain in the region of the wound. The sudden onset of pain, sometimes so sudden as to suggest a vascular catastrophe, always suggests the possibility of gas gangrene in a wounded person. Soon afterwards the limb becomes oedematous and is associated with drainage of thin serous or serosanguinous exudate, which may become gelatinous. The pulse rate rises markedly but the patient’s temperature is rarely higher than 38° C. As classically described, clinical deterioration takes place quickly and within several hours the patient becomes anxious and frightened, or may even be euphoric, and exhibits all the signs of severe sepsis. The skin is tense, pale, often marbled with blue, and rather colder than normal. In untreated cases, local bronzing of the skin becomes more diffuse, greenish yellow areas appear in which blebs may form and become filled with dark red fluid, and patches of cutaneous gangrene may occur. The skin may , however, appear normal, even when lying over massive gangrene. INFECTIONS IN WAR WOUNDS Figure 13.1.1 Figure 13.1.2 Gas gangrene of the leg following the application of a tourniquet. Gas gangrene of the arm. Rapidly, swelling oedema and toxaemia increase, the serous discharge becomes more profuse and a peculiar sweetish smell may be present. The smell is variable and not pathognomonic. Gas is usually produced at this stage and is partly responsible for the swelling of the affected part (Figure 13.2). It is produced in and between the muscle fibres, follows the fascial planes, and eventually escapes into the subcutaneous tissues under pressure through holes in the fascia, spreading rapidly beyond the confines of the infected area. Crepitus may be felt under the skin if the part is palpated. The extent of the spread of gas is not equivalent to the extent of muscle necrosis. Infection spreads up and down the muscle from the site of the wound but has little tendency to spread to other healthy muscles; the bacteria is a strict anaerobe . Even in well-established gas gangrene, the bloodstream is rarely invaded by Clostridia until  immediately before death. The muscle changes are usually only seen at operation. In the early stages, they consist of little more than swelling and pallor. Later, the colour alters to a lustreless pinkish-grey, then to brick red, and finally to a dark green-purple colour."}
{"text": "\n## Management\n\n All patients with missile wounds should receive prophylactic antibiotics that are effective against Clostridia, such as penicillin, metronidazole, or erythromycin. But the antibiotics can only reach tissues with a blood supply and good tissue perfusion. Antibiotic concentrations in the dead muscle in the depths of an anaerobic environment are ineffective. Surgery as early as possible is the goal to be attained. The basis of management of established gas gangrene is thorough excision of dead tissue, which might necessitate urgent amputation . The limit of excision is necrotic muscle, not the extent of tissues containing gas. Tissues must be cut away until healthy red, bleeding, and contracting aerobic muscle is reached."}

{"text": "\n## 13.3.3 Tetanus\n\n Tetanus is always a risk with any penetrating wound. The risk is greater for severely contaminated wounds, especially in small, deep, punctate-type ones. Pyogenic infection in the depth of a narrow track can create the necessary anaerobic environment. The incubation period is 3 to 21 days, but can be as short as 1 day to as long as several months. Figure 13.3 Badly infected wound giving rise to tetanus. Figure 13.4 Risus sardonicus in a patient suffering from tetanus. Virtually total protection can be obtained by active immunization with a full course of tetanus toxoid injections. Clostridium tetani is a strict anaerobe. The organism produces an extremely potent toxin called tetanospasmin that spreads along peripheral nerves to the spinal cord and brainstem. The toxin affects the motor end-plate by inhibiting cholinesterase, resulting in a build-up of acetylcholine and tonic muscle spam. There is, in addition, hyperexcitability of lower motor-neurones causing muscular rigidity and dysfunction of activity in antagonistic muscles that cause unopposed reflex activity, giving rise to the typical spastic phenomena of tetanus. Early signs are neck rigidity and trismus (stiffness of the jaw) with difficulty in swallowing, followed by risus sardonicus (grimacing smile). Profound autonomic nervous system dysfunction is also present in severe cases with unstable pulse rate, blood pressure, and temperature, which are difficult to treat. Once the toxin is fixed to the nerves, anti-tetanus immunoglobulin can no longer neutralize it. The infection may affect a single muscle group or be more generalized. Three clinical degrees are described: • mild = no generalized spasms; • moderate = generalized spasms on provocation; • severe = spontaneous generalized spasms with opisthotonus. The muscular spasms are quite painful, and can last a short time or go on for several weeks. The greatest danger is asphyxiation due to laryngeal spasm or aspiration. Frequently, there is a high temperature with profuse sweating that requires careful fluid replacement. The patient remains conscious throughout."}
{"text": "\n## Prophylaxis\n\n The best precaution against tetanus is active immunization. However, many patients in developing countries where conflict has further disrupted public health programmes are not immunized and therefore the risk of tetanus in war wounds is great. In some countries, ICRC practice is to proceed with active and passive immunization for all patients. INFECTIONS IN WAR WOUNDS Early and adequate excision of dead tissue, and leaving wounds open, is vital to prevent its development. This is particularly important in small, deep, punctate-like  wounds. Penicillin and metronidazole are the drugs of choice. Tetanus prophylaxis for war wounds All patients whatever their immunization status: 1. tetanus toxoid vaccine 0.5 ml i.m. (5 LF units) – this is a booster dose in a previously vaccinated patient; 2. penicillin; 3. thorough excision of the wound. Non-immunized patients or those in whom immunization status is in doubt, addition of: 4. human tetanus immunoglobulin 500 IU i.m. (adults) or 250 IU (children under 15 years of age) – also known as human anti-tetanus serum; 5. tetanus toxoid 0.5 ml i.m. to be repeated at four weeks and again at six months. Vaccine and immunoglobulin should be administered through separate syringes and at separate sites. Treatment of established tetanus should follow the steps listed below.  Extensive debridement of the wound. Ketamine anaesthesia should be avoided if possible as patients waking from this form of anaesthesia are often restless and have hallucinations and this may stimulate spasms. Spinal anaesthesia or a regional nerve block are excellent methods. 2. Antibiotics: crystalline penicillin G (5 MIU. i.v. QID) and/or metronidazole (500 mg i.v. TID). Erythromycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol are also active against Clostridia, in case of allergy to penicillin. 3. Anti-tetanus human immunoglobulin (3,000 – 10,000 IU): a single large dose is given intravenously and as soon as possible. The actual dose ordered is dependent on the severity of the disease and the age of the patient. It is diluted  in 20ml of normal saline and given slowly over a period of 15 minutes. This can be given intramuscularly (undiluted) in the proximal part of the wounded limb if the type of immunoglobulin is not recommended for intravenous use. An intrathecal injection of 250 IU can be given e.g. with spinal anaesthesia for debridement of  the lower part of the body.  In some regions, human immunoglobulin is in short supply or not available at all.  In these circumstances, one must rely on equine anti-tetanus serum. A test dose must be administered before giving the full dose (20 000 IU). 4. Control of the spasms: the patient should be nursed in an environment as devoid of stimulation as possible in a dark, quiet room. For severe cases, and in the best of circumstances, the patient should be in an intensive care unit, anaesthetized and paralysed, with mechanical ventilation. Many hospitals lack these facilities; control is based on sedation. WAR SURGERY Intravenous diazepam, either intermittently or continuously, is used with doses up to 20 mg or more per hour depending on the duration and intensity of the spasms. If diazepam alone does not control the spasms, chlorpromazine may be added, or thiopental (pentothal) may be required. This latter is given preferably by continuous infusion, which has been found to control the spasms more effectively"}
{"text": "\n## Warning!\n\n \n## Oversedation can be as fatal as the disease.\n\n Recently, ICRC teams have used magnesium sulphate in high doses (40 mg/kg over 30 minutes, followed by i.v. infusion of 1 – 3 g/hour) with encouraging results. This regime allows lower doses of diazepam and thiopental to be used, thus avoiding oversedation: this line of treatment is still under investigation. 5 5. Airway management is of the utmost importance to prevent aspiration. lf laryngospasms persist tracheostomy may be needed, and the decision to perform one should be taken early. Care of the tracheostomy tube is instituted with particular attention to how much this stimulates spasms, and adapting the sedation accordingly. Chest physiotherapy is required to prevent respiratory complications. 6. Fluid replacement: there may be excessive fluid loss due to sweating – this needs to be carefully monitored along with urinary output. A Foley urinary catheter should be placed. 7. Nutrition: if the spasms continue for some days, a feeding gastrostomy or jejunostomy may be required as a nasogastric tube may provoke spasms and become obstructed. Again, it is important to decide to perform this procedure early. These patients require a high calorie diet. 8. Excellent nursing care is fundamental. The patient's position must be changed four-hourly. Extra sedation may be required prior to this, as movement can provoke spasms. Patient hygiene – skin, oral and bowels – is essential. Please note: Clinical tetanus does not confer normal immunity. The patient therefore needs to complete immunization after recovering from the disease."}

It begins with a local cellulitis with severe pain out of proportion with physical findings, and advances rapidly to fever, tachycardia, disorientation and delirium. The wound is malodorous with large quantities of thin, blood-stained seropurulent discharge. The muscles suffer from a moist oedema, and turn from pale, to bright red, then dark purple-brown.

{"text": "\n## 13.3.5   Necrotizing soft-tissue infections\n\n Various non-clostridial spreading gangrenous infections have been described in the surgical literature: necrotizing fasciitis, synergistic gangrene, anaerobic cllulitis, etc. There is necrosis of the skin, subcutaneous tissues and fascia, but not of the muscles. It can rapidly progress to systemic toxicity and even death. Spreading gangrene can follow trauma or thoracic and abdominal surgery (postoperative synergistic gangrene), and affect persons suffering from a general disease, such as diabetes, or malnutrition; alcoholics are particularly at risk. Infection usually affects the torso, perineum or extremities. The bacterial flora is mixed causing synergy amongst various organisms, anaerobic and aerobic, particularly microaerophilic nonhaemolytic streptococci in association with haemolytic staphylococci. In no case are healthy muscles involved, and the clinical picture is less dramatic than in gas gangrene. Nonetheless, the systemic toxicity is life-threatening. There is severe pain disproportionate to local findings, crepitus can often be felt and soft-tissue air is present on plain X-rays. The skin is discoloured (blue, purple or black) with blistering leading to haemorrhagic bullae and induration. The necrosis can spread widely causing a large soft tissue defect. The diagnosis is primarily a clinical one, and the earlier treatment is instituted the better the result. Management includes: • aggressive excision of necrotic tissue and the relief of tension, which may require serial debridements – amputation may be necessary in cases of necrotizing infections of the limbs – and defunctioning colostomy in cases of infection of the perineum with faecal contamination; • leaving the wound open for drainage; • triple intravenous antibiotics: penicillin, gentamycin and metronidazole; • fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion and other supportive treatment. Reconstructive surgery to cover the defect should only be considered once the patient’s condition has stabilized and the infection is fully eradicated."}
{"text": "\n## 13.4   Antibiotics\n\n It is important to distinguish between the prophylactic use of antibiotics and their role in the therapy of established sepsis. The surgeon must also remember the life history of wounds and their changing bacterial flora. Prophylaxis is aimed at preventing a specific infection. It is impossible to find any reasonable cocktail of antibiotics that would be effective against the entire \"polymicrobial cesspool\" that can contaminate a war wound. Nor is it desirable to do so. Such a practice would constitute a simple abuse of antibiotics and contribute to the development of bacterial resistance."}
{"text": "\n## Old lessons for new surgeons The best antibiotic is good surgery.\n\n The surgeon must realize that trust in the efficiency of antibiotics will never replace good surgery. Good surgery involves good diagnosis, good clinical decision-making, and good holistic management of the patient. Sometimes \"good surgery\" means knowing when not to operate. As we have seen, uncomplicated Grade 1 wounds and many civilian gunshot wounds can be treated conservatively and expectantly. Figure 13.6.1 and 13.6.2 Figure 13.6.1 and 13.6.2 Necrotizing fasciitis with large skin loss and tissue defect. WAR SURGERY War wounds, however, are usually understood to be different from civilian weapon trauma; not always because of the weapon, but because of the environment. The battlefield is a dirty and contaminated place and the danger of invasive infection is always present, even in minor wounds; mass casualties cannot always be followed up correctly; there is often a long delay between injury and treatment; proper hygiene and Under such circumstances, the basis of prevention of primary infection remains complete wound excision and good drainage, respect in the handling of the tissues, and leaving the wound open for delayed primary closure. Antibiotics are only an adjunct to good surgical practice, and cannot replace poor surgery. A case can be made for prophylaxis against the second series of infections, those acquired from the flora of the patient (skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts) if the occurrence of such infections becomes an important clinical problem in the functioning of a given hospital, and is proven by proper bacteriological studies. Infections caused by bacteria with multiple antibiotic resistance and by opportunistic organisms, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , have become more prevalent with the uncontrolled use of wide-spectrum antibiotics. Again, good surgery and proper hygiene measures and environmental control cannot be replaced by antibiotics, and their use should be regarded as an adjunct only. The prevention of nosocomial infection is another story. Proper clinical protocols and hygiene are the correct means of prevention: frequent hand washing; no unnecessary change of dressings on the ward; isolation of infected patients; adequate sterilization; proper cleaning of the hospital premises, etc. These alone can and will stop nosocomial infection. The use of antibiotics to supplement such measures will depend on the virulence of the particular bacteria involved. A well-functioning bacteriology laboratory is important if antibiotic use is to be anything more than a \"shotgun\" approach or an \"educated quess\". Wound cultures are notorious for not predicting subsequent infections or infecting pathogens. In the absence of correct collection of specimens, aerobic and anaerobic, and proper bacterial culture and sensitivity techniques, an educated guess is the best that can be hoped for in most cases. Accurate bacteriological capability is a far more difficult endeavour in a forward hospital than most people realize."}
{"text": "\n## 13.4.1   Antibiotic prophylaxis in the primary treatment of war wounds\n\n Antibiotics do not reach the source of infection in a missile wound – i.e. the culture medium of dead tissue, debris and foreign material – they only affect the contusion and concussion zones around the wound. However, early administration of antibiotics seems to inhibit bacterial growth and delay invasive infection. Antibiotics especially help prevent spread to the blood stream. The benefit of antibiotics to prevent invasive infections in wounds that received no other treatment for hours to days after injury has been demonstrated, 6 and ICRC clinical experience confirms this. The ICRC recommends that penicillin treatment be begun in the pre-hospital setting if at all possible. As mentioned, historically, the biggest killers of surviving war-wounded casualties have been primary infection by β-haemolytic streptococcus and Clostridia. This is a relatively narrow spectrum of bacteria, for which penicillin remains the best antibiotic.  Prophylaxis for war wounds can only be assured for  Clostridia and β-haemolytic streptococcus: penicillin is the drug of choice.  Mellor SG, Cooper GJ, Bowyer GW.

In the ICRC context of limited resources, often less than ideal environmental control, and delayed evacuation, antibiotics are usually given for 5 days, until delayed primary closure. This period of 5 days may be regarded as an exaggeration by some colleagues, but is considered a reasonable combination of a prophylactic and therapeutic regime by ICRC practitioners and has proved its Topical antibiotics and the washing of wounds with antibiotic solutions are nt recommended."}

In many areas where the ICRC works, typhoid fever and shigellosis, amongst other infections, are endemic diseases. Resistance to first-line antibiotics for these fatal diseases is becoming more and more of a problem in clinical practice. Often, cephalosporins are the only recourse left available. The judicious use of antibiotics is an important element to keep in mind when dealing with the surgery of the victims of war, where proper surgical, nursing, and hygiene measures should be the basis of prevention and treatment of infection."}

{"text": "\n## 14.1 The surgeon and the foreign body\n\n There are hundreds of thousands of perfectly healthy people walking around the present and past war zones of the world who have retained projectiles in their body. These metallic foreign bodies often catch the attention of patients and relatives, who impute to them any pains and disabilities they suffer from and insist upon their removal, even after the wound has completely healed. It can be very difficult, and frustrating, for the surgeon to point out to an insistent patient that a projectile is dangerous when moving but is no longer so when it has come to a stop. The incidence of late infection is low (2 – 3%)¹ and vascular embolization rare and more common with fragments than bullets. The risk of embolization – “migrating bullet” – is more common in published clinical cases in the specialized surgical literature than it is in real life. One American study from Viet Nam reported a rate of 0.3% in 7,500 cases with arterial injuries; and rarer still in the overall wound population.² The frustration is directly related to the number of patients presenting with such requests, who can at times be counted literally in the hundreds. The problem tends to be psychological and cultural rather than surgical. How can one convince a young combatant that the operation to remove a bullet may cause more damage than the bullet has accomplished? Such a foreign body in the midst of a muscle mass, where there are no pain receptors, is not painful and the surgeon must find a way to overcome the patient’s subjective fixation; perhaps by making the bullet’s presence a matter of \"pride\". The experience of the ICRC shows that many of these operations to remove a projectile are risky, useless, consume time and materials, and result in new surgical trauma with its possible complications, often without identification and removal of the foreign body. There are few surgical endeavours more frustrating for an unprepared young surgeon than to spend two hours searching ever more frantically for an \"easy\" fragment or bullet, and finally not finding it."}
{"text": "\n##  Early indications for removal 14.2\n\n However, as stated previously, there are indications for removal of bullets and fragments, which may be divided into early and late. The most important early indications have been dealt with in Chapter 10: as an integral part of the primary operation or to address the possibility of erosion of an important structure (Figures 10.11, 10.12 and 14.1). As mentioned in the latter case, whether the removal is an immediate or planned procedure will depend on a number of factors, especially the experience of the surgeon and the possible morbidity and lethality of the operation itself compared to the relatively low incidence of serious complications arising from leaving the projectile in place. The decision is not always a simple one and the reader may consider what should be done in the following examples (Figures 14.2 – 14.8).

The following scenarios should be added to the early indications already mentioned. • A small fragment in a heart chamber – the concomitant pericardial tamponade is an urgent condition, the removal of a retained fragment is not – or a fragment obviously within the lumen of an important vessel. The possibility, and danger, of embolization is high in these particular instances. Operation should only be undertaken, however, if the surgeon and anaesthetist are experienced and the necessary diagnostic and operative equipment are available. • A projectile located in the spinal cord: emergency laminectomy and removal should be considered only if there is clear progressive neurological deficit and radiological evidence of spinal cord compression by the foreign body and the surgeon is experienced in this field. A definitive diagnosis of paraplegia, indicating that the spinal cord is irrecoverably sectioned, means that it is already too late. • Small metallic fragment penetrating the eye: removal is indicated if located in the anterior chamber, again, only if the surgeon is experienced, and magnification, proper instruments and suture material are available."}
{"text": "\n##  Late indications 14.3\n\n Late indications are largely the result of the complications listed below. Sepsis If the projectile, along with surrounding contaminants, is acting as a nidus for infection: an abscess or sinus. The removal is performed as a planned operation after the necessary diagnostic procedures (X-ray, sinugram, etc.). Pain If located superficially, especially if over a pressure point (palm of hands, sole of foot, elbow, etc.), the projectile will cause true pain. The removal may be performed as an elective procedure after healing from the acute trauma. Pain lf the foreign body is impinging on a nerve and causing radicular pain or paraesthesia. As above, the removal is performed as a planned operation. Figure 14.11.1 Figure 14.11.2 Figure 14.11.1 Bullet in antero-lateral compartment of the leg pressing on common peroneal nerve.

The response to an EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid) challenge is a  useful diagnostic test. Standard chelation therapy is instituted (EDTA, dimecaprol, d-penicillamine, succimer) and the surgical removal of the metal should not be performed before serum lead levels have been reduced to avoid acute lead poisoning.³ This complication does not arise with an intact, full metal jacket bullet where no lead filling has spilled out.

{"text": "\n## 14.4 Technique for the removal of a projectile\n\n For those patients requiring removal of a deeply-seated metallic fragment or bullet, proper localization prior to surgery is of the utmost importance. Most rural or provincial hospitals do not have fluoroscopy or an image-intensifier in the operating theatre enabling the surgeon to operate under direct vision. A simple stereotactic technique to assist localization involves taping a series of radio- opaque objects (paper clips, injection needles, Kirschner wires) to the body part, both anterior and lateral surfaces, to act as guides. Plain X-rays with antero-posterior and lateral views are taken. The radio-opaque objects are then removed and their position on the skin marked with a felt pen. By looking at the two X-ray views, the surgeon can estimate the relative distance of the bullet from the radio-opaque objects in the axes both across and in the depth of the body part – e.g. half-way between the second and third paper clips in the A-P view and one-third of the way between the first and second paper clips in the lateral view. The idea is to use two-dimensional X-rays to extrapolate into three dimensions. The films should be taken on the morning of the operation and the patient should be Figure 14.12.1 and 14.12.2 Figure 14.12.1 and 14.12.2 Stereotactic localization of metallic foreign body. Safety-pin is anterior and paper clip lateral. In due course, the body will form tough avascular scar tissue around the metallic fragment: a foreign body granuloma. This includes other foreign matter and dirt, and should be excised together with the projectile. Linden MA, Manton WI, Stewart RM, Thal ER, Feit H.

{"text": "\n## 15.1 Introduction\n\n Burns are a common event in a war environment. Flame weapons, explosive blast and ignition of combustible materials all create burn hazards. The causal agent may be thermal, chemical, electrical, or linked to radiation. Each cause has specific A serious burn injury is a painful and life-threatening event requiring an inordinate amount of hospital resources and nursing care. The most immediate threat to life is an impaired airway due to inhalation of hot air and smoke with consequent oedema; the most important subsequent threats to life are from hypovolaemic shock and infection, followed by the complex pathophysiological effects which continue after injury. It is associated with many complications, prolonged morbidity, multiple operations, and great demands on equipment, materials, medical and nursing time. The long-term sequelae, physical, cosmetic and psychological, deeply affect the morale of both patients and staff. Modern burn centres have made great progress in the successful treatment of major burns, but such facilities are never available in situations of limited resources. Nevertheless, the principles of treatment are the same, and the aim is to do the best one possibly can under the austere circumstances, where stark reality imposes its frustrating limitations. Surgery will have the greatest impact on young people with small but potentially crippling injuries such as bilateral hand burns. Patients with burns covering 40 – 50% of the total body surface will rarely survive under field conditions and are best treated by giving sufficient fluids to relieve thirst, and generous amounts of analgesia. In a triage situation of mass casualties they are considered Category IV: i.e. given supportive treatment only."}
{"text": "\n## 15.2 Pathology\n\n \n## 15.2.1   Burn depth\n\n Burns involve varying amounts of injury to the skin, partial or full thickness, and classically correspond to three degrees of burn depth of increasing severity (Figure 15.1). First degree burns: First degree burns, or superficial burns, are painful, red, and have no blisters. They will hal on their own."}
{"text": "\n## Second degree burns:\n\n These may be superficial or deep partial-thickness burns. They are invariably blistered and the blister floor is usually pink or mottled red in appearance and the surface is moist. The less they blanch with pressure, the deeper they are. They are painful and have some sensation to pinprick. Hairs will be difficult to pluck out if the base of the follicle is alive. Most will eventually heal by a combination of re-epithelialization and wound contraction, but often with a seriously disabling scar contracture. Some will benefit from appropriate skin grafting."}
{"text": "\n## Third degree burns:\n\n These refer to full-thickness burns. Destruction of the full thickness of the skin gives a charred, leathery or waxy appearance. Any surviving hairs pull out easily. The burns are usually dry and have no sensation. Injury may extend to the muscles and deeper tissues. They are normally caused by flames, immersion in very hot liquids, electric current or chemicals. Smaller full-thickness burns will eventually heal by contraction but this inevitably causes severe deformity and loss of function. They are best treated by skin grafting.  WAR SURGERY First degree burn: superficial epidermis. Second degree burn: superficial partial thickness. Second degree burn: deep partial thickness. Third degree burn: full thickness and may extend beyond the dermis. Figure 15.1 Histology of the skin and degree of burn depth. Figure 15.2 Different regions of a burn wound have different depths of damage: central eschar of full- thickness burn surrounded by areas of partial- thickness burn. Different regions of a burn wound have different depths of damage. A burn is basically an ischaemic three dimensional wound with: • a zone of coagulation – a central area of irreversible skin death that creates the eschar; • a zone of stasis – a middle layer of damaged but viable tissue with a significant inflammatory reaction, but an early stasis of local blood flow; • a zone of hyperaemia – a deep and peripheral area that looks like cellulitis, but is oly hyperaemic. Appropriate fluid resuscitation preserves cells in the zone of stasis, but subsequent infection or drying of the wound can rapidly enlarge the injury, both peripherally and in depth."}
{"text": "\n## Superficial burn wounds are painful; deep burns are an a sthetic.\n\n \n## 15.2.2   Pathophysiological changes\n\n The most important pathophysiological change from thermal injury is increase in capillary permeability, which, if resuscitation is successful, returns to normal within 24 – 48 hours. Plasma water and proteins up to a molecular weight of 350,000 are freely exchanged between the intra- and extravascular compartments of the extracellular space. A strongly negative interstitial fluid pressure develops that creates a strong \"suction\" in the burnt tissue. If the affected area is very large, these changes become widespread with the loss of important amounts of fluid from the vascular compartment. This loss is most marked in the region of the burn wound and accounts for the local oedema, which peaks at 6 – 12 hours post-burn. However, with aggressive crystalloid resuscitation in large wounds (>25 – 30% of the total body surface area or TBSA), the hypoproteinaemia causes a systemic disorder resulting in generalized oedema of non-injured skin and internal tissues, above all swelling of the larynx, and resultant obstruction to the airway, and abdominal compartment syndrome.  For further details on abdominal compartment syndrome, see Volume 2. BURN INJURIES There is an associated rapid rise in the haematocrit which, together with polymerization of some plasma proteins, causes a marked increase in blood viscosity. The immediate danger linked to the sequestration of fluids in the extravascular space is hypovolaemic shock and, with haemoconcentration, acute tubular necrosis and renal failure. The loss of skin cover, and its function as a regulator of temperature, means that hypothermia, with its complication of coagulopathy, is an ever-present danger (see Chapter 18)."}
{"text": "\n## 15.2.3   Types of burns\n\n Flame and scald burns are by far the most common. Flame burns are usually deep and appear so at presentation, whereas scald burns may appear much less severe at first; experienced burn surgeons usually withhold prognostication until they have inspected them on the third day. Contact flame burns are typically very deep at the centre, which should be taken into consideration if they are to be operated on. Electrical burns fall into two distinct categories. Flash burns occur when a person causes a short circuit and resulting electrical flash, but no current travels through the body. These may be treated as regular thermal injuries. High voltage (>1,000 volts) electrical conduction injuries – the current travels through the body and is characterized by the “can’t let go” phenomenon – are \"iceberg injuries\" as they usually present with small cutaneous wounds and severe deep-tissue damage. Chemical burns are caused by particular agents: acids, alkalis, and specific compounds (napalm, phosphorus, vesicants, etc.), with their individual characteristics."}
{"text": "\n## 15.2.4   Extent of burns\n\n The sequestration of large amounts of fluid and plasma proteins in the extravascular space is a function primarily of the extent of burnt tissues. It is thus important to estimate the total body surface area that has been burnt. The depth of the burn must also be taken into account; only second and third degree burns are included in the estimation of TBSA. The simplest calculation is best done using the \"Rule of Nines\" (Figure 15.3). The size The head and neck of a child under one year of age represent about 18% and the lower extremity 14% of TBSA (Figure 15.4). With age these figures gradually change to adult proportions. Although it is difficult to grade the severity of burn wounds, the following provides a rule of thumb. Minor: • second degree less than 15 % TBSA; • third degree less than 3 % TBSA."}
{"text": "\n## Moderate:\n\n • second degree 15 – 25% TBSA; • third degree less than 10% TBSA.

{"text": "\n## Burn management 15.3\n\n The management of burns follows a series of standard measures as with any wound or trauma. 1. First aid. 2. Resuscitation: - breathing; 3. Analgesia. 4. Prophylactic antibiotics. 5. Tetanus prophylaxis. 6. Nutrition. 7. Hypothermia. 8. Wound management."}
{"text": "\n## 15.3.1   First aid\n\n Rescuers should first ensure that the scene is safe and take suitable precautions if un-ignited fuel, explosives, electricity, or chemical agents are present. The patient should be removed to safety and clean fresh air, and the vital signs assessed. If available, oxygen should be provided if there is any indication of smoke inhalation. The burn should then be cooled with water or wet towels (for 20 minutes), and covered to reduce pain. The patient should not, however, be left wrapped in cold wet material so long as to provoke hypothermia. After cooling the burn , keep the patient warm. If evacuation to the hospital is delayed and the airway is not at risk, the patient should be encouraged to drink plenty of small quantities of fluids often and regularly, and the colour and volume of the urine monitored. The following elements should be determined: • nature of the causal agent – flame, scald, contact, electrical conduction, electrical flash, chemical; • possible aggravating factors – additional trauma, smoke inhalation (fire in an enclosed space equals smoke inhalation); • time since injury – fluid resuscitation is calculated from the time of burn , not the time the patient arrives at hospital. As with all injured persons, examination begins with the ABCDE sequence. Deep burns to the face, neck or anterior chest cause laryngeal oedema, which increases dramatically with fluid resuscitation. Inhalation of smoke, hot gases or chemical products contributes to this swelling. However, critical laryngeal oedema can occur in any deep burn to this important area. The patient should be checked for burnt hair in the nostrils or soot in the nose, mouth or sputum. The airway must be secured and kept open, preferably by tracheostomy. This should be performed before the airway is compromised since it will be very difficult once oedema has closed the airway and cutting through oedematous tissues can be bloody and complicated. BURN INJURIES"}
{"text": "\n## Please note:\n\n Because of this oedema even the tracheostomy hole will disappear in the depths of the tissues. Rather than an ordinary tracheostomy tube, an endotracheal tube should be inserted in the tracheal opening. True smoke inhalation induces carbon monoxide poisoning and a chemical pneumonitis related to the inhalation of hot toxic gasses. Carbon monoxide poisoning should be assumed in any person found unconscious at the scene of a fire, and is treated by administering as high a concentration of oxygen as possible for 6 hours. Increased fluid requirements early in resuscitation suggest severe inhalation injury, which may not appear on a chest X-ray until the second or third day. Inhalation injuries increase the 24-hour fluid requirements by 1 – 2 ml per kg of body weight per percentage of TBSA (1 – 2ml/kg/%), about 50% increase. Hypoxia and hypercapnoea despite maximal oxygen supplementation or ventilation are ominous signs. Serious cases of smoke inhalation will not usually survive without mechanical ventilation. This can be difficult to organize in a setting offering limited resources. The sequestration of large amounts of fluid and plasma proteins in the extravascular Only second and third degree burns should be included in the estimation of the percentage of TBSA. Therefore, the patient must be completely exposed and the extent and depth of the burn carefully estimated using the “Rule of Nines”. The patient should be weighed and the \"homunculus\" diagram used to assess and mark the extent of the injury. Particular attention should be paid to circumferential burns which may require escharotomy. The natural tendency is to overestimate the extent of the burn. In controlled series this has been shown to be up to 25%. A good idea is to first calculate the burnt area and then the area which is not burnt; the total should add up to 100%. Another natural tendency is to underestimate the depth of the burn; periodic re-examination will help to determine this better. Patients with burns of moderate and major severity should get a Foley catheter placed in the bladder to monitor the hourly urine volume, which is the most important single measurement for adequacy of resuscitation. A nasogastric tube should also be passed and, if there is no acute gastric dilatation, enteral feeds can be started within the first 24 hours. Early feeding through the nasogastric tube and appropriate acid suppression (antacids, H2 blockers) prevent acute haemorrhagic gastritis, which is usually fatal. Where maintaining an i.v. line is difficult, fluid resuscitation may be administered via the nasogastric tube or even orally in smaller burns. This may be particularly useful in small children. Adequate analgesia (intravenous narcotic) is necessary at all stages of burn management. ICRC practice is to give penicillin for the first five days to prevent invasive haemolytic streptococcal infection; any other infection is treated ad hoc. Tetanus prophylaxis must be instituted as required. Other associated injuries (penetrating wounds, fractures, etc.) must be diagnosed and treated in parallel with the burn wound. WAR SURGERY"}
{"text": "\n## 15.3.3 Initial fluid replacement therapy\n\n Given adequate initial resuscitation with crystalloids, the capillary integrity is mostly restored within 18 – 24 hours following the burn. At this point, colloid can be given and will stay within the vascular compartment, increasing the plasma volume. Cardiac output will respond to fluid replacement long before blood and plasma volumes return to normal and a first, mild diuresis begins at about 12 hours after fluid therapy. Red cell life is reduced and although replacement of red cell mass is not necessary for the first 48 hours, for major burns blood transfusion will probably be necessary after this time. Most minor burns presenting less than 15% TBSA second degree damage do not require formal i.v. fluid resuscitation and can be treated with oral fluids, and patients can be managed on an outpatient basis. (Some surgeons prefer to hospitalize even a 3% full-thickness burn, especially to the face, hands or feet.) Moderate and major burns require hospitalization and intravenous fluids. The ICRC uses the modified Brooke/Parkland formula¹ for fluid resuscitation. There are three phases in resuscitation therapy. 1. First 24 hours following the infliction of the burn wound (not from the start of treatment). 2. Second 24 hours. 3. After 48 hours. Ringer's lactate is the fluid of choice. Administration should be divided into three 8-hour periods. Ringer’s lactate solution 2 – 4 ml/kg/% burn = total volume for first 24 hours: Fluid administration should start at the low end of the formula (2 ml/kg/%; for children start at 3 ml) and the hourly urine output monitored. There is a non-linear relationship in burn patients between the infusion rate and the urine flow. Normal urine flow is described as 0.5 – 1.5 ml/kg/hour. The lower limit should be aimed for, and any increase above this should call for a lowering of the infusion rate to avoid over-resuscitation. Apparently, there is a natural \"oedema-limiting mechanism\" related to the amount of fluid that is easily mobilized from plasma into the burnt areas. Giving more fluid to maintain tissue perfusion and urine flow above this threshold may close down this mechanism and lead to more tissue fluid sequestration (tissue is a \"fluid addict\" ²); giving even more intravenous fluid does not lead to improvement. If the urinary output is low and does not respond to increased infusion in the second eight-hour period, the third eight-hour period Ringer’s lactate should be replaced with colloid, plasma or 5% albumin if available. If the vascular compartment is well- filled, however, but the patient is not making urine, the kidneys are likely to be failing and may respond to furosemide or mannitol. 1 Brooke formula: 2 ml/kg/% TBSA for first 24 hours; Parkland formula: 4 ml/kg/% TBSA for first 24 hours.

Constant monitoring is required and, after 12 hours, the patient's condition and fluid requirements should be reviewed and recalculated."}
{"text": "\n## Please note:\n\n Not only is there a natural tendency to overestimate the TBSA but, in much contemporary clinical practice, it has been discovered that over-resuscitation has become more common and more of a problem than under-resuscitation. The traditional fear of renal failure has led many clinicians to administer an excess of fluids. This has been called \"fluid creep\" ³ or \"resuscitation morbidity\" and manifests itself most commonly as pulmonary oedema and, later, abdominal compartment syndrome, delayed wound healing, increased susceptibility to infection, and multiple organ failure. It should be remembered that the fluid resuscitation formula is only a guideline, and actual amounts of i.v. fluids should be adapted accordingly."}

Plasma should be administered: 0.3 – 0.5 ml/kg/%/day.\n\n If plasma is safe and available , theoretically it is best given at this stage. Albumin 5% run at 50 ml/hour for 2 – 3 days is an expensive alternative, but the evidence to support either strategy is very slim. Otherwise, and in ICRC practice, Ringer’s lactate should continue to be given at the rate of one-quarter of the first day's volume; intravenous fluid should be adjusted to urine output and enteral feeding increased as tolerated. This will provide not only essential nutrition but free water to cover evaporative losses from the burn wound."}
{"text": "\n## 15.3.4   Monitoring resuscitation\n\n Clinical evaluation is particularly important in the absence of sophisticated means and laboratory measures. A clear sensorium, good tissue perfusion, good pulse, and an adequate urinary output are all signs of good progress. Less and less fluid is neded at the end of resuscitation in order to maintain urine volume. A flow sheet should be used to monitor vital signs and fluid input/output. The patient should be serially weighed if possible."}
{"text": "\n## 15.3.5   After 48 hours\n\n Mobilization of burn wound oedema causes an expansion of the blood volume and results in massive diuresis, high cardiac output, tachycardia and anaemia.

If available, plasma or albumin should be given to maintain serum albumin of 20 g/l and blood to maintain haemoglobin greater than 70 g/l. Deep burns cause greater anaemia. Fresh whole blood is best. Potassium, calcium, magnesium and phosphate are generally excreted in large amounts at this time, and should be supplemented where possible. 3 Pruit BA Jr. Fluid and electrolyte replacement in the burned patient.

{"text": "\n## 15.4  Burns presenting late\n\n Often, patients with severe burns present late. Those presenting after a delay, but within the first 24 hours, should receive fluid resuscitation and an attempt should be made to infuse most of the calculated volume by the end of 24 hours from the Patients presenting after 24 hours will probably need some fluid but the amount should be guided primarily by clinical assessment of hydration and renal function. Patients who have survived the first 72 hours without renal failure have compensated the losses themselves (usually with oral fluids); they may require some rehydration but infection of the burn wound is the main concern. For those presenting weeks after the burn, infection is compounded by poor nutritional status, anaemia, and hypoproteinaemia. In these cases steps should be taken to control infection (debride grossly infected necrotic tissue) and to improve nutrition before any definitive surgery is undertaken. Early creation of a feeding gastrostomy should be considered."}
{"text": "\n## 15.5   Nutrition\n\n Catabolism is particularly elevated in burn patients, especially those losing large amounts of protein through open wounds, and healing will require an important increase in caloric and protein intake for a lengthy period. Early enteral feeding is very important in maintaining gut function (reducing gastroparesis), and preventing complications. Major burn patients may require more than twice their normal protein and calorie intake until their wounds have closed. Nutritional requirements may be easily calculated for the individual patient (see Annex 15. A: Nutrition in major burns). Blenderized enteral feeding solutions can readily be made from commonly available local foods and can be delivered by naso-gastric tube, gastrostomy or jejeunostomy. Especially when dealing with burn wounds that are weeks to months old, the patient’s nutritional status should be evaluated and improved before any attempt is made at skin grafting or both the graft and the donor site risk delayed or failed healing."}
{"text": "\n##  Care of the burn wound 15.6\n\n After successful resuscitation of the patient has been achieved, the next greatest threats to life that must be addressed are the burn wound itself and the complications of sepsis. The aim of treatment is to achieve healing of the burn by the following measures. 1. Control of bacterial colonization by removal of all dead tissue. 2. Prevention of accumulation of purulent fluid and debris. 3. Prevention of secondary bacterial contamination. 4. Maintenance of an environment which promotes wound healing. 5. Avoidance of techniques or treatment which will damage the healing burn wound. Most of the morbidity and mortality associated with major burns are the result of infection. All the methods for cleaning the wound, excising dead tissue and treating the burn are directed towards the control of “burn wound sepsis”. Untreated, eschar desiccates and sloughs off by means of bacterial enzymatic invasion of the plane between viable and non-viable tissue. Full-thickness burns will require skin grafting to heal properly; otherwise, healing will be by fibrous tissue contraction alone with chronic open wounds and disabling scar contracture. BURN INJURIES In partial-thickness burns, viable areas of dermis underlie the necrotic tissue and if sufficient epidermal cells remain at the base of skin appendages, such as sweat glands and hair follicles, re-epithelialization will gradually take place if given the right conditions. Infection will transform a partial-thickness burn into a complete-thickness one. Because of the complete or partial ischaemia associated with burn wounds, systemic antibiotics may not reach the site of bacterial colonization. Local treatment, both mechanical and antimicrobial, are the basic elements of wound care."}
{"text": "\n## 15.6.1 Initial wound management\n\n Initial wound toilet should be undertaken after resuscitation has begun and proceed in parallel. Once the patient's condition has stabilized, attention can be turned to more definitive measures. Any constricting agents (rings, wrist-watch, jewellery, etc.) should have been removed on admission. The patient should be sedated and the burn wound gently washed with soap and water. Freely running, clean water, without excess pressure but a regular flow and at a temperature comfortable for the patient, is best. This will cool the burn, decrease pain, and remove superficial debris and adherent clothing. Small intact blisters may be left undisturbed but large, bloody, or pus-filled blisters, and those which interfere with joint movement, should be unroofed and debrided. Large burn wounds may be more easily cleaned by placing the patient in a shower. Baths should be avoided because of the attending logistical difficulties and the danger of cross-infection under field conditions. The routine daily immersion of burn patients in filthy tubs of cold water is to be condemned. Particular attention should be paid to circumferential deep burns. During the first 48 hours the increasing oedema of the tissues and the thick unyielding burn eschar may result in a tourniquet effect. Circumferential burns of the chest will restrict breathing and those of the limbs will cause peripheral ischaemia which can lead to amputation. This disaster is easily averted."}
{"text": "\n## Escharotomy is the process of incising the eschar down to the subcutaneous fat to allow relief of the constriction.\n\n Escharotomy should be performed with a sharp knife or electric diathermy through the burnt skin into the subcutaneous fat. Escharotomy incisions are placed in the mid-lateral and mid-medial lines of the affected extremity and should extend up to, but never include, unburnt skin. A \"T-cut\" at each end of the escharotomy allows tissue to expand without causing an acute constriction at the end of the incision. On the hands, the mid-lateral incisions coming down each side of the forearm should be swung onto the dorsum, and branched to make a single escharotomy incision down the mid-lateral line of each finger on its less-used side. (i.e. ulnar side of thumb, index and ring finger; radial side of middle and little finger). A thoracic escharotomy begins at the midclavicular lines, continues along the anterior axillary folds down to the costal margin, and across the epigastrium to the xphoid process."}

Figure 15.9 Though full-thickness burns are usually anaesthetic, the escharotomy should be done with some form of anaesthesia as the edges can be very painful and the cut goes into the subcutaneous fat. Ketamine is ideal. Particular attention should be paid to burns with underlying fractures or burns extending deep into the fascia; these can create a compartment syndrome. Formal fasciotomy, with excision of the aponeurosis, may be necessary in addition to escharotomy. Severe perineal burns may necessitate faecal diversion."}
{"text": "\n## 15.6.2   Local care\n\n Care of burn wounds involves an extraordinary amount of nursing care. The method used depends on the depth, extent, and location of the burn. ICRC surgical teams use occlusive dressings – and its plastic bag modification – and open therapy; both with a topical antibacterial agent. Many antibacterial compounds can be used. Silver sulphadiazine (Flamazine®) and silver nitrate solution are unique in that they can penetrate the wound surface and reach the bacteria beneath it; therefore, they are best for infected full-thickness burns. Antibiotic ointment (polymyxin/bacitracin or similar) and paraffin gauze is another excellent dressing, particularly for partial-thickness burns with no eschar. Honey and ghee dressings can be used where expensive compounds such as silver sulfadiazine are scarce. Equal parts of honey and either ghee (clarified butter), or oil, are mixed together and poured over open sheets of gauze in a pan. The honey provides a hyperosmotic environment that discourages bacterial growth and the ghee or oil keeps the gauze from adhering. Silver nitrate solution (0.5%) is effective but oxidizes easily, staining everything it contacts black. Other agents used around the world include gentian violet, which desiccates the burn, tea which tans the burn like leather, papaya and banana leaf, boiled potato skins, fermented fish sauce, and Amazonian frog skin. In some instances local methods may be preferable to imported products."}
{"text": "\n## Occlusive dressings\n\n Bulky sterile dressings relieve pain and are comfortable for the patient, and protect the burn wound from infection. They absorb serum and exudate and foster a moist healing environment by keeping the injured part immobile and warm; they contain The dressings have three components: an inner layer of a liberal application of silver sulphadiazine covered by fine-mesh gauze or paraffin gauze; a middle layer of large gauze-wrapped absorbent cotton pads, which absorb the exudate and protect the wound; and an outer layer of bandages that secures the dressing. If the dressing becomes soaked through, the outer layers should be changed or bacterial contamination will occur by capillarity. Dressings should be changed every day or two under adequate analgesia, and the old silver sulphadiazine washed off in the shower. The wounds should be inspected and gently cleaned at dressing time, and morsels of dead eschar removed with scissors and forceps. Occlusive dressings are best for small burn areas, especially on the limbs, or when hygienic conditions are less than optimal."}
{"text": "\n## The plastic bag or surgical glove method\n\n This method is used for burns to the hands and feet. After cleaning the burn and applying silver sulphadiazine directly to the wound with a spatula or the gloved hand, a plastic bag is used as a glove or a sock, tied around the wrist or ankle. It must not be too tight. The limb should be kept elevated to reduce swelling. The burnt area will be kept moist and movement of the joints, both passive and active, is encouraged. A surgical glove may also be used instead of a plastic bag; it allows for more mobility during physiotherapy. BURN INJURIES"}
{"text": "\n## Open therapy\n\n Where resources are inadequate to allow for occlusive dressings, this is the method of choice – as well as being the standard method for burns of the face and perineum – but requires clean and isolated surroundings, and the ambient temperature must be warm; hypothermia is to be avoided at all costs. The patient is placed on clean sheets and the burnt area left completely exposed. Silver sulphadiazine ointment is applied to the burn wound liberally with a sterile gloved hand and repeated twice daily or as required. If the room is cold, the patient may be covered with a clean sheet and blanket draped over a frame to prevent contact with the wound. The entire bed should be kept under overhanging mosquito netting. The advantages of this method of treatment include simplicity of examination of the burn wound and ease of nursing care. It also allows early mobilization by physiotherapy. The disadvantages are pain, odour, and desiccation of the wound, delayed eschar separation and hypothermia. Frequent showering is required to wash away exudate and fragments of softened eschar. The bed linen must be changed regularly; it is readily dirtied by the burn exudate. Local customs and religious practice may limit the use of this “open” method. Figure 15.10 Open burn therapy with frame. Facial burns are best treated open with frequent gentle cleansing and application of moist warm saline gauze soaks, interspersed with application of topical antibiotic ointment (e.g. polymyxin/bacitracin). Beards and facial hair growing through the burn should be shaved at least every two days to prevent accumulation of exudate which may harbour infection. Antibiotic eye ointment should be applied frequently to the conjunctiva if the lids are burnt and retracted, to prevent keratitis and corneal uccration. The lids should only very rarely be sutured together (blepharoplasty) as  the sutures almost inevitably pull out causing yet more damage to both lid and globe."}
{"text": "\n## 15.7 Closure of the burn wound\n\n The preparation of the burn wound and its subsequent closure are the two main steps in the surgical management of burns. The type of surgery required depends upon the skill and training of the surgeon, the specific burn injury, and the facilities available to support the treatment, especially the availability of blood for transfusion. Like all other injuries treated under difficult circumstances, great judgement is required to select the technical procedure that is appropriate. Partial-thickness burns will generate new epithelium on their own if infection is prevented. The wounds should be inspected carefully as they progress. In superficial partial-thickness burns (and donor skin graft sites) epithelial cells grow out from around tiny skin appendages giving a typical “leopard spot” appearance in those with pigmented skin and, on close inspection, a slightly dull, silvery coat of epithelial cells may be seen growing atop the dermis (Figure 15.12.1). Tiny white pearls of epidermis herald re-growth and healing; areas of raspberry-red granulating dermis or fat do not have sufficient epidermal cells to heal (Figure 15.12.2). A \"nicely granulating\" burn wound is not a good thing unless there is a plan to graft the wound. ICRO Figure 15.11 Healing burn to the face.

Figure 15.12.1 Partial-thickness burn well on the way Granulating burn: no healing. The pale colour of the For full-thickness burns, the eschar may be removed completely in a single procedure or in a number of stages. The aim of treatment is to prepare the wound for eventual closure and to prevent colonization by bacteria and fungi."}
{"text": "\n## 15.7.1   Mechanical cleansing and debridement\n\n Thorough cleaning and removal of debris and fragments of eschar are performed at each dressing session. Gentle washing and sharp debridement of dead skin fragments should be combined with thorough irrigation with water. The surface can then be cleansed with a mild disinfectant (dilute hypochlorite solution, detergent soap) and thoroughly washed again with water. Silver sulphadiazine is reapplied. Where resources are scarce, the cycle of dressing and plucking can be continued until the wound is completely free of eschar. This gives partial thickness burns the optimum chance to re-epithelialize and minimizes the area that will require grafting. Such patients need large amounts of nursing time, dressing material, and will probably require blood transfusion even without surgery."}
{"text": "\n## 15.7.2 Surgery\n\n The most difficult decisions in burn care involve the timing and extent of surgery. Judicious staging of burn surgery is highly important and, where possible, should take into account the patient’s livelihood. Donor and graft areas should be matched in advance and the process broken down into manageable parts. Attention should be paid to how the body parts will be positioned for the operation: if the plan is to graft the arm, it should be seen to before the hand as the latter will be needed to hold up the arm for surgery. The hands, feet, and joint surfaces are considered priority areas in order to re-establish function; early grafting of these parts must be balanced against the metabolic advantages of closing larger areas on the limbs and torso. At least two weeks should pass before grafting of facial burns is considered, as even quite deep burns may go on to heal on their own. Eyelids are the first priority here."}
{"text": "\n## Tangential excision\n\n The removal of the full thickness of the burn wound is performed in a single session. Early tangential excision and immediate grafting of burns reduces mortality, morbidity, suffering and hospital stay while improving functional and cosmetic results, but it requires considerable resources and is impracticable for areas larger than 10% TBSA outside specialized burns centres. It is bloody surgery. BURN INJURIES Most field surgeons should be conservative with regard to this technique. It is, however, recommended in ICRC practice for small burnt areas, especially on the face, hands and feet, and over joint surfaces. In tangential excision of the eschar, the superficial layers of the burnt tissue are progressively shaved away by knife, dermatome or cutting diathermy until viable tissue is reached. Traditionally, this is determined by the appearance of copious punctuate bleeding. It is accompanied by significant blood loss and is the most important limiting factor of this technique. Blood loss can be reduced by Esmarch bandage exsanguination of the limb and a tourniquet, and subcutaneous infiltration of a dilute adrenaline solution (1:500,000); in the face, lidocaine with adrenaline can be used. The subcutaneous infiltration of some type of fluid (saline, dilute adrenaline solution, or local anaesthetic), causes a local tumescence that facilitates the excision. With adrenaline solution, as dead burn eschar is sliced away, the surgeon should look for a level with visible pearly white dermis, or glistening yellow fat, and no capillary thrombosis. After excision, larger bleeders should be cauterized and the wound wrapped for ten minutes with gauze soaked in adrenaline solution. The wrapping should be removed, and the process repeated until there is no active bleeding, before the skin graft is applied. When tangential excision is successful, only dead tissue is removed. It can be difficult to judge how much to take away in order to leave a viable layer that will take an immediate skin graft."}
{"text": "\n## Face\n\n The skin of the face, particularly the beard areas on males, is very thick and well populated with deep epidermal cells that will provide for re-epithelialization if given time. If there is any doubt about the depth of burn on the face it is best to wait two weeks before tangential excision. As mentioned, face burns are treated by the open technique with warm wet gauze soaks, followed by gentle cleaning and the application of a local antibiotic ointment, with shaving every second day. Severe face burns will require scraping and cleaning under general anaesthesia to properly evaluate which areas are healing and which will eventually need grafting. Gauze soaked in an adrenaline-saline solution (1:33,000) should be used and pressure applied to control bleeding. When clean, a thin coat of antibiotic ointment should be applied and the previous dressing routine resumed while waiting to decide whether to excise and graft. Excision of a small deep burn to the face can be performed under local lidocaine with adrenaline anaesthesia; larger areas require general anaesthesia, but simultaneous subcutaneous infiltration with a dilute adrenaline solution will render the excision easier and less bloody."}
{"text": "\n## Hands, feet, and joint surfaces\n\n Tangential excision of the hands, feet and joint surfaces can be performed at three days onwards, once the patient is well resuscitated. Many severe hand burns will benefit from early escharotomy since deep partial- thickness or full-thickness burns heal with extremely disabling contractures; operating these early should be considered and good, thick skin for the grafts saved. Typically people clench their fists when they sustain a burn so the palmar skin extending up to the mid-lateral lines of the fingers is usually preserved, or burnt much less deeply than the dorsum, and rarely needs grafting. Therefore most burnt hands and fingers will only require grafting of the dorsum. If the escharotomy was performed accurately along the edges of the full-thickness burns along the mid-lateral lines of the fingers, this will mark the extent of excision necessary. WAR SURGERY Figure 15.13 Figure 15.13 The \"safe position\" for splinting a hand. Figure 15.14.1 Meshed skin graft: recipient site. Figure 15.14.2 SG after grafting. Proper preparation is the key to good excision. The areas to be excised should be carefully marked with ink or gentian violet. The hand and forearm should be exsanguinated by five-minute elevation and application of a rubber Esmarch bandage, beginning with the hand and progressing proximally; a pneumatic tourniquet is then applied. (Correct use of a tourniquet is painful; the operation should be performed under general anaesthesia.) Normal saline or a weak adrenaline solution should be infiltrated subcutaneously over the dorsum of the hand. The edges  of the areas to be excised should be scored with a #15 blade. Tangential excision should be performed using a small dermatome or scalpel, preserving viable dermis where possible and being very careful not to damage tendon sheaths. The hand should be wrapped in adrenaline-soaked gauze and the tourniquet briefly released. The tourniquet should then be re-inflated for ten minutes to allow natural haemostasis, then removed. The hand should be unwrapped and diathermy used to cauterize remaining bleeders. Wrapping in adrenaline gauze and cauterizing of bleeders may need to be repeated several times to ensure perfect haemostasis prior to application of the skin grafts. Sheets of relatively thick split- thickness skin should be used. Grafts should be carefully tailored over the dorsum of the hand and fingers, and sutured in place. Each finger should be covered in paraffin gauze dressing, then wrapped independently in gauze, taking care to leave the tips of the fingers exposed in order to assess perfusion. Finally, the hand should be splinted in the \"safe position\" (Figure 15.13) with the wrist dorsiflexed 30°, the metacarpal-phalangeal joint flexed as close to 90° as possible, the fingers splayed apart and the inter-phalangeal joints straight. The initial dressing should be left for 5 – 7 days and then unwrapped carefully. The graft should then be re-dressed daily with paraffin gauze and the hand re-splinted. Physiotherapy and mobilization should begin as soon as the grafts are solid. A hand should never be immobilized longer than ten days. K-wires placed through the fingers may help in bad cases. The same general principles apply to the feet and over joint surfaces. Early tangential excision gives the speediest recovery and best functional and cosmetic results when it is practicable, but should never be undertaken for large areas unless the resulting blood loss can be properly managed."}
{"text": "\n## Skin grafting\n\n The hands, feet, and joint surfaces are priority areas for skin grafting, with or without tangential excision. The anterior chest and neck take priority over the belly and buttocks. The back has very thick skin, and so burns to it may be observed for some time while waiting to see if they will heal on their own. Allowing burns to granulate and demarcate under dressings (2 – 6 weeks) is prudent practice where resources are scarce. This means accepting inevitable protein loss from open wounds, possible infection, delayed healing, and chronic anaemia; supplementary To prepare for grafting, the jelly-like granulation tissue must be scraped away with the back of a scalpel handle before the skin graft is carefully secured and dressed. The advantage of delayed grafting is that often a much smaller area need eventually be grafted. Grafting on burns is time-consuming and adequate time should be allocated for these operations. The staging of the surgery should be carefully planned and just one limb or body area operated at a time. In general, the thinner the graft, the better its chances of \"take\", and the thicker the graft, the better the functional and cosmetic result (see Chapter 11 for details on skin grafting). A limb or digit that has to be amputated should be regarded as a prime source of donor skin. Harvesting of grafts in children whose skin may be extremely thin should be performed with great care. If there is no solid layer of dermis left behind, the donor site will not heal. Except on the face, hands and feet, skin grafts should be meshed to allow serum to drain through rather than lift the graft off the bed of the recipient site. BURN INJURIES Old wounds or sites where previous grafts have failed are notorious for difficulty in achieving an adequate graft take. Good nutrition and meticulous preparation of the surface are the keys to success. Early excision of grossly dead and infected tissue, topical and systemic antimicrobial therapy, and aggressive nutritional supplementation should precede any attempt at skin grafting. The best course may be to graft critical areas while The surface of the debrided burn wound often has a superficial slime of exudate and bacterial contamination. Dressings with a supersaturated saline solution (add salt to normal saline until it no longer dissolves), changed frequently for a couple of days, will produce a clean, bright red granulating surface ready for grafting. The occlusive dressing which is applied after skin grafting plays a great part in the survival of the graft. It must be put on with great care. The dressing must hold the graft closely applied to the recipient site for the first few days for capillaries to grow in. Any blood or serum that floats the graft away from its bed will cause it to fail. The life of a patient with a severe burn is in danger until the dead tissue has been excised and the defect closed with a healthy skin graft."}
{"text": "\n## 15.8  Scar management\n\n Burns always result in scars and the burn graft itself is best thought of as a scar. One of the most disastrous consequences of burns is the severe scar contracture that may render life horrendous for the victim afterwards. Management of the burn scar begins before grafting, during local care of the burn wound. Rigorous splinting – using plaster of Paris slabs – and stretching routines should be implemented to prevent contracture of major joints: the limb should be splinted against the force of contracture. If a joint is equally burnt on both sides, it should be splinted in extension. Airplane-strut type splints should be used for burns to the axilla. Patients must be given adequate analgesia for the daily passive stretching exercises. Much, if not most of the functional benefit of burn grafting depends on assiduous splinting and stretching of the tissues afterwards to manage the process of burn scar contraction. This can be particularly active in children – a perfect operation may result in recurrence of a dreadful scar if the tissues are not managed properly over the next 6 – 12 months. All burn grafts crossing joints should be splinted at operation with plaster slabs. Later, when the grafts have taken, a plaster slab covered in tube bandage and fitted correctly makes an excellent, reusable splint that can be worn at night and removed for therapy during the day. Dedicated staff and adequate analgesia are essential to active and passive stretching of burn scars; if this hurts too much the patient will simply not comply. Burns crossing joints should be splinted and stretched even if they have not been grafted, as this will reduce the degree of contraction as the scar heals. Pressure garments are important to optimum scar management and their use results in much softer and more pliable scars. Where they are not available, elastic bandages and a variety of tight-fitting stretchy commercial clothing may help. Water-based skin cream will help with itching as will antihistamines. Burn scar massage is also helpful where traditional practitioners are present. Figures 15.15.1 and 15.15.2 Post-burn scar contractures. WAR SURGERY"}
{"text": "\n## Electrical burns 15.9\n\n As mentioned, there are two distinct categories. With flash burns, the patient typically presents with fairly deep burns to the face and one or both hands and forearms. Treatment is as with regular thermal injuries. High voltage (>1,000 volts) electrical conduction injuries have small cutaneous entry and exit wounds, which extend deep into the muscles causing myonecrosis. The rhabdomyolysis has a systemic effect, with myoglobinaemia and myoglobinuria leading to acute tubular necrosis; and a local effect, i.e. compartment syndrome. The patient should receive Ringers' lactate, with 50 mEq sodium bicarbonate per litre, in sufficient volume to maintain urine output at 0.5 ml/kg. If the urine is dark or bloody, or urine output ceases, the vascular space should be well filled and a bolus of 20% mannitol given (1g/kg); furosemide may be added as well. Any suspicious compartments should be released promptly by generous full-length fasciotomy, including carpal tunnel release in the forearm. Dead muscle should be debrided conservatively, and numerous returns to the operating theatre may be needed (serial debridement). Numerous complications attend electrical conduction injury including arrhythmias (ECG monitoring is strongly recommended), cervical fractures associated with the jolt of electricity, intestinal perforation and a variety of unusual neurological sequelae."}
{"text": "\n## 15.10 Chemical burns\n\n A number of chemical substances cause specific burns. The presence of any of them on an injured person poses a danger to first aiders, hospital staff, and other patients. Careful removal of contaminated clothing and proper decontamination measures must be undertaken – of the patient and of any equipment used – and specific protocols followed to protect the medical personnel treating the patient."}
{"text": "\n## The wounding chemical agent constitutes a danger to first aiders, hospital staff, and other patients. Proper protective measures must be taken.\n\n In general, acids cause coagulative necrosis of the skin, and strong alkalis liquefactive necrosis and burrowing of the chemical deep into the tissues. “Acid violence\" involving the throwing of concentrated sulphuric acid into the face is an increasingly common phenomenon and the chemical is readily available wherever there is a motor vehicle garage. The acid burn should be washed with very large volumes of water and the eyes thoroughly irrigated. Strong alkalis may come in dry form (NaOH crystals); any remaining material must be brushed off the patient before washing with water. After this decontamination, the treatment of chemical burns follows the same sequence as the treatment of thermal burns. Acid attacks usually involve the face and typically cause extremely disfiguring injuries which are very difficult to reconstruct."}
{"text": "\n## 15.10.2   Phosphorus burns\n\n Some modern anti-personnel weapons contain white phosphorus. This element ignites on contact with air, and fragments of phosphorus will be scattered throughout any wounds; it is lipid soluble and sticks to the subcutaneous fat. The burn is deep and painful and the phosphorus continues to burn as long BURN INJURIES as it is in contact with oxygen or until all the phosphorus is consumed, all the way down to the bone. Local treatment is more urgent than with conventional burns because of the aggressive nature of phosphorus. Much of the injury in an individual patient, however, results from the ignition of clothing, which causes a conventional burn. Contaminated clothing must be removed immediately, care being taken not to contaminate the staff attending to the casualty. Visible, smoking particles can be removed with a spatula or knife, and should be placed in a basin of water to exclude them from the air. Phosphorus burn wounds must then be isolated from oxygen by being kept wet through liberal soaking with water, by covering with wet dressings, or by placing the injured part in a basin of water. On no account must they be allowed to dry out. When surgical treatment is available, the idea is to identify and remove the remaining phosphorus particles. The wet wound can be irrigated with a neutralizing agent. A freshly prepared solution of 1% copper sulphate combines with the phosphorus to form black copper sulphide, which impedes violent oxidation and identifies the particles. The black particles can then be removed with forceps and placed in a basin of water. The solution must be very dilute, the palest blue colour, since its absorption can cause haemolysis and acute renal failure. If used, the copper sulphate solution must be washed away immediately. Or, if copper sulphate solution is not available, the operating theatre lights may be put out; any remaining particles will glow with phosphorescence in the dark and can be carefully picked out with forceps Care must be taken not to allow the wound and the phosphorus to dry out and re-ignite in theatre; appropriate, non-flammable anaesthetic agents should be used. In all cases, the wound should then be excised and dressed as usual. Phosphorus may provoke hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia; intravenous calcium should be given. Absorbed phosphorus can be toxic to many organs: • central nervous system – delirium, psychosis, convulsions, coma; • gastro-intestinal tract – abdominal colics, melaena; • liver – hepatomegaly, jaundice; • kidneys – proteinuria, acute tubular necrosis; • blood – thrombocytopenia, hypoprothrombinaemia; • myocardium – ventricular arrhythmia, myocarditis."}
{"text": "\n## 15.10.3   Napalm injuries\n\n Napalm is jellied petrol, an intensely flammable agent that clings to the clothing and skin while still burning and causes serious, deep and extensive burns. Its incomplete combustion of the oxygen in the air around the victim provokes an acute rise in carbon monoxide that can lead to a loss of consciousness and even death. The intense heat and benzene fumes easily cause inhalation burns. Napalm burns are invariably full thickness, with coagulation of muscles and other deep tissues. Nephrotoxicity is a serious complication of the rhabdomyolysis, and the mortality may be high in proportion to total body surface area involved. A full- thickness burn of only 10% of the body surface area may result in renal failure. The patient should be kept well hydrated and in alkalosis; mannitol may be necessary to protect renal function. First-aid treatment includes extinguishing the burning napalm by smothering it, i.e. excluding the oxygen. Unlike phosphorus, napalm does not then reignite in contact with the air. Surgical treatment involves removal of the napalm with a stick, spatula or knife. The wound is then excised deep to any remaining contaminant, care being taken to avoid contact (\"no-touch\" technique), and dressed as usual. WAR SURGERY"}

Certain chemicals have a potential dual function: they can be used in weapons and are widely employed for civilian purposes (the disinfection of public water supplies in the case of chlorine). Traditional chemical weapons are either neurotoxic or vesicant (blistering); the latter cause burns to the skin and inhalation injury. Vesicant agents (mustard gas, lewisite, phosgene) cause skin burns similar to flame burns. The patient's clothing must be removed and properly destroyed. The patient is then decontaminated with abundant soap and water. Care must be taken not to contaminate hospital personnel, equipment, and other patients with the chemical agent. Correct decontamination protocols include the use of protective clothing and Once decontamination has been performed, the wounds are dealt with in the traditional manner; however, a \"no-touch\" technique should be used during wound debridement and removed tissues disposed of with care.

The difference between the calculated energy requirement (3,997 kcal) and that provided by protein and glucose should be made up with fat.

{"text": "\n## 16.1 Physiology of thermal regulation\n\n The significance of prevention and treatment of local cold injuries during armed conflict cannot be overemphasized. Although most commonly seen in arctic and subarctic climates, cold injuries can occur whenever the combination of cold, wet, and immobility exists. High altitudes, even in tropical or temperate regions, can  experience cold weather. Wind is an aggravating factor in all circumstances. Normal body temperature is maintained through a balance between heat production and heat loss, and is regulated by a hypothalamic “thermostat”. At least 95% of the heat produced by the metabolism of viscera and muscles is normally lost to the environment by conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporation, largely through the skin and lungs; the head and neck account for 20 – 30%. The skin primarily dissipates heat by regulating its blood flow, which may vary from 50 ml/min to 7,000 ml/min. In a cold environment, the core temperature (that is, the temperature of the vitally important visceral organs) is conserved by decreasing heat loss through peripheral vasoconstriction, and by increasing the production of heat by involuntary muscle contractions (shivering). If the heat loss exceeds the heat-producing resources of the body, the core temperature begins to fall and hypothermia develops. Wetness and  wind increase the effect of cold in inducing loss of body heat. In peripheral tissues subjected to low temperatures, wetness, wind, and contact with a cold surface (metal), local cold injury may result from vasomotor and/or cellular effects, including intracellular ice crystal formation."}

{"text": "\n## 16.2.1   Non-freezing injury\n\n This is also known as \"immersion foot\" or \"trench foot\", and is seen in prolonged exposure to cold ambient temperatures above freezing, with high humidity and immobilization, as often witnessed during the trench warfare of World War I, hence the name. Prolonged wetness and cooling of the feet, as can occur in a jungle or rice paddy, can also provoke an \"immersion foot\" injury. Such injuries are diagnosed and treated like other cold injuries, except that the feet should not be immersed in warm or hot water."}

{"text": "\n## 16.3.1   First aid and transport\n\n When a body part is frozen solid for hours it runs a lesser risk of tissue loss than when it is exposed to a cycle of thawing, refreezing, and thawing. A person can continue to walk on a frozen foot while it remains frozen; but will be unable to walk after thawing because of the pain and swelling. This should be kept in mind before pre-hospital treatment is attempted; it might be preferable to transfer the patient to adequate shelter and facilities rather than begin treatment with inadequate means. The patient should be moved to a sheltered place as soon as possible. Boots and socks should be removed, avoiding trauma to the skin. As with burns, constricting agents such as rings should also be removed. As some degree of central hypothermia generally coexists with local cold injury, the general body temperature should be raised by hot drinks, blankets, or skin-to-skin contact. The frozen extremity should be prevented from thawing before normal core temperature is reached. Once hypothermia has been corrected, any available form of heat transfer (skin-to- skin contact, foot-in-axilla, hand-to-nose) should be utilized to warm the body part. Rapid rewarming in warm water (40 – 42°C, or just tolerable to elbow immersion) should only be used when it is certain that refreezing can be avoided. Analgesia is essential, as thawing of frostbite is extremely painful.  Do not:  • rub or massage injured tissue; • apply ointments or other topical medication; • break blisters; • rewarm by exposure to fire, radiant heat or excessively hot water."}
{"text": "\n## 16.3.2   Hospital treatment\n\n Central hypothermia should be dealt with first through external rewarming by blankets and warm water bath. In severe cases (core body temperature below 30° C) combined or not with frostbite, central warming has a priority over peripheral warming because of the risk of \"after-drop\". This represents a situation where the core temperature tends to decrease during peripheral heating of the body. Rewarming of the limbs causes a local vasodilatation with shunting of cold stagnated blood towards the central part of the body; arrhythmias and cardiac arrest may result. Central core warming measures include warm i.v. fluids, rectal enema, and bladder, gastric and peritoneal lavage at 37° C. A low-reading thermometer is necessary to satisfactorily monitor core temperature (see Chapter 18)."}
{"text": "\n##  Hypothermia takes precedence over local cold injury. General rewarming should precede local rewarming.\n\n Once hypothermia has been sufficiently corrected, attention may be given to the local cold injury. Superficial injuries may be rewarmed rapidly in 40 – 42° C water. For deep injuries, if the limbs are still frozen or cold and vasoconstricted, they should be rewarmed with dry heat at 37 – 39° C. Even if only one limb is affected, both should be rewarmed together until the nail beds become pink. The patient should receive 100 % oxygen, warmed and humidified, during the warming process.

Amitriptyline is the preferred analgesic for immersion injury. Tetanus prophylaxis and penicillin should be given. Smoking is contraindicated.

The extremities should be kept on sterile sheets under cradles. Sterile cotton pledgets are placed between toes or fingers. Warm povidone iodine soaks twice daily help prevent superficial infection. As blebs appear, precautions are taken to avoid their rupture: they should not be allowed to dry up. The limb should be placed so as to avoid pressure on the injured part as much as possible. A good functional result will be helped by maintaining active exercises and elevating the affected limb. It is difficult to predict the extent of eventual tissue loss from frostbite during the first weeks after injury. Tissue loss, however, is generally smaller than expected. It is therefore important to wait until the damaged tissue becomes necrotic and mummified, with a clear line of demarcation and spontaneous amputation of fingers or toes. As with burns, escharotomy of circumferential injuries, and even fasciotomy, might be necessary."}

{"text": "\n## 17.1 Introduction\n\n Standard anaesthetic practices, as utilized in trauma care, should be followed. However, providing safe and effective anaesthesia under circumstances of limited resources is probably the most challenging task of hospital work. Many limitations must be accepted owing to security concerns, lack of infrastructure, and difficult logistics."}
{"text": "\n## A reminder to surgeons: operations are \"big\" or \"small\". All anaesthesia is potentially fatal.\n\n This chapter is not intended for anaesthetists, but rather presents what surgeons should know about anaesthesia when working under precarious circumstances. There are several reasons for this. 1. Surgeons perform \"big\" operations and \"small\" operations. There is no such thing as a \"small\" anaesthesia. Every anaesthesia is potentially fatal. The limits  of operational activity in the theatre are not those of the surgeon’s expertise. They are determined far more by the level of competency and sophistication of the anaesthesia department. The anaesthetist will tell the surgeon what can be done; not the other way around. The surgeon must understand, and accept, this limit. There is only one other limiting factor that is as important as anaesthesia, if not more so, in determining the level of sophistication of surgery to be performed: postoperative nursing care. 2. In wartime, a surgeon may sometimes find himself without an anaesthetist. In this case, the war surgeon must know how to administer safe and adequate anaesthesia in order to perform the most important and basic of lifesaving procedures. There is much that a surgeon alone can do in terms  of anaesthesia. Good knowledge of local anaesthesia techniques – practical, cheap and safe – can be very helpful when resources are limited. 3. Moreover, in many countries practising surgeons far outnumber the anaesthetists, and this is likely to remain the case in the foreseeable future. Anaesthesia in low-income countries is often administered by a nurse or technician under the \"guidance\", and medical responsibility, of the surgeon, who must understand the important indications and contraindications of the various anaesthetic techniques. Needless to say, the surgeon must know about the possible complications of the anaesthesia used and how to counter them. It would be presumptuous to try to explain the safe administration of anaesthesia in a half-dozen pages. This account comprises the basic precepts that a surgeon should be familiar with. For a full description of appropriate anaesthetic techniques under circumstances of limited resources, practicable by a surgeon or other medical officer, the reader is referred to the excellent texts listed in the Selected bibliography.

{"text": "\n## ICRC EXPERIENCE\n\n The points listed below have been found to be particularly important by ICRC anaesthetists and may be useful to other humanitarian organizations or foreign staff operating in a war environment in a new and strange context. • The presence of a good interpreter, preferably with a medical background, is essential for communication with patients. Unfamiliarity with anaesthetic equipment and local conditions increases the likelihood of complications. The presence of an assistant knowledgeable about local standards is essential. The assistance of a second person – doctor, nurse – preferably with experience in anaesthesia, is mandatory for all anaesthetic procedures. Assessing the time the patient last ate is difficult, especially with breastfed babies.  Many of the wounded, especially in hot climates, are severely dehydrated. It is   important to correct any hypovolaemia before surgery. • Routine premedication is not necessary. Arrangements for blood transfusion may be complicated (negotiating with family or clan members) and require local blood-collecting procedures to be activated. Likely blood requirements should be ordered early."}
{"text": "\n## Anaesthesia methods 17.2\n\n Local and regional anaesthesia techniques are excellent and can be used in many patients, although they tend to be underestimated and, therefore, underused: a below-knee amputation or Caesarean section can be performed under local anaesthesia, for example. They are safe in avoiding vomiting and aspiration, especially when the time of the last meal cannot be determined accurately. Oxygen, nitrous oxide and other volatile anaesthetics may be in short supply. In the context of actual combat, oxygen cylinders are to be banned. Not only are the logistics for refilling cylinders and transporting them difficult and dangerous, but the presence of an oxygen cylinder is the equivalent of a bomb. Oxygen concentrators – with a pulse oxymeter for control – are standard ICRC equipment for these circumstances; however, they require an electrical supply. Ketamine is the anaesthetic of choice in ICRC practice for major surgery. Equipment for the use of ketamine is minimal – not even an oxygen concentrator is necessary – and muscle relaxants can be added to provide full general anaesthesia. The further the hospital from the actual conflict zone, the more sophisticated the equipment and supplies that may be provided, and therefore the techniques employed. The following anaesthetic agents and their characteristics should be well known to surgeons. ANAESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA"}

{"text": "\n##  Ketamine is the anaesthetic of choice for major war\n\n \n## 17.4.1   General considerations\n\n Ketamine is very safe, and can be given intramuscularly, or as an intravenous bolus or perfusion. lt causes amnesia, analgesia, and a state of dissociation. The patient feels detached from the environment, but his reflexes are intact, particularly the laryngo- pharyngeal reflexes that protect the airway. Opening of the eyes, shouting, and limb movements are frequent and normal ; the patient is nevertheless anaesthetized. It may cause hallucinations and should be combined with a sedative such as a benzodiazepine (diazepam is inexpensive but burns on injection; midazolam is not irritant but is costly). Ketamine increases the cardiac output and the arterial blood pressure and, therefore, is particularly useful in patients with haemorrhagic shock. Ketamine dilates the bronchi, but also increases bronchial secretions and saliva. Atropine should be administered first to control saliva and bronchial secretions. There are important contraindications to the use of atropine: marked tachycardia, hypertension, valvular stenosis, hyperthyroidism, or fever. Ketamine also increases the muscular tone, which is why it makes a laparotomy, and especially the closure of the abdomen, more difficult if used without myorelaxants. There is no absolute contraindication for ketamine anaesthesia. Relative contraindications include: • psychiatric disease, • mitral or aortic stenosis, • untreated hyperthyroidism, • eclampsia, • epilepsy, • operation on the eye – this is due to nystagmus, which causes the globe to move and makes operating difficult. The question of the use of ketamine in patients with a head injury or increased intracranial pressure has been controversial, although based on very few and very early reports in the 1970s. There is no longer any contraindication for its use in these patients consistent with evidence-based medicine, and ICRC standard practice includes craniotomy performed under ketamine anaesthesia (see Selected bibliography). The advantages of ketamine are the following: • easy and rapid to administer with quick onset of action; • safe; • provides anaesthesia, amnesia, and analgesia; • circulation is stimulated; • respiration remains normal (very slow intravenous injection); • protective airway reflexes remain intact in the majority of patients – vomiting may however occur: staff should be ready to suck clean the mouth and secure the airway; • maintains cerebral blood flow; • particularly suitable for infants.

A solution is made of ketamine in normal saline and placed in a different vein from that used for fluid replacement. The rate of infusion is titrated against the patient's response, both for induction and as maintenance of anaesthesia.

{"text": "\n##  ICRC EXPERIENCE\n\n The Senior Anaesthetists Workshop recommended that, in exceptional circumstances (extreme emergency with a very small ICRC surgical team, no training of local staff intended, equipment to be withdrawn afterwards), the ICRC deploy small portable ventilators \"to free the hands\" of the anaesthetist. These ventilators must be able to function with an oxygen concentrator (there must be a regular supply of electricity) rather than with compressed air or oxygen. They were sent to Banda Aceh, Indonesia, after the 2006 tsunami hit this conflict-affected area because of an “epidemic” of tetanus cases encountered there. Hallucinatory side effects do occur with ketamine, and once encountered are likely to be repeated on other occasions in the same patient. The frequency of hallucinations tends to differ with different population groups, and bizarre reactions may occur in heavy users of alcohol or other drugs. In addition, such patients do not reach the required state of general anaesthesia unless a neuroleptic and opioid are added. The incidence and severity of hallucinations can be lessened by using diazepam 10 mg i.v. at least 5 minutes before induction and another 10 mg i.m. at the end of the procedure. After the operation, patients often sleep for hours. They should be in a calm and quiet place. On awakening, they respond to orders \"show your tongue\" or “raise your head”. Sometimes these patients are very loud, they shout or sing, and move a great deal. This is normal and not dangerous for them."}

Analgesic drugs have a better effect in combination than alone; e.g. paracetamol and a NSAID have additive actions because of their different sites of action. 3. Local anaesthetic infiltration or blocks are used whenever appropriate in conjunction with other forms of analgesia. 4. Injectable analgesics act more quickly and are more effective if administered as an i.v. bolus, titrated until the desired effect has been achieved. This is especially true in case of hypovolaemia and shock where the peripheral circulation is decreased and, therefore, the intramuscular or subcutaneous routes are unreliable. 5. The choice of drugs is made with the staff and facilities in mind; e.g. opioids may be undesirable if proper monitoring is unavailable. 6. It is advisable to institute a system of pain scoring, especially for post-operative pain relief. ANAESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA "}
{"text": "\n## 17.5.2   Pain scoring systems\n\n Pain intensity can be measured in various ways and the use of a system of measurement is recommended. The choice of scoring system depends on a number of factors, including cultural issues and the level of literacy and numeracy of patients and the nursing staff. In all of them it is the patient who assesses the intensity of pain. Common scoring systems include the following."}
{"text": "\n## Verbal score\n\n The pain intensity is measured using words: • none • mild • moderate • severe • extreme"}

The availability of particular drugs for pain relief in a given country is often subject to importation and distribution restrictions. The widespread abuse of opioids in particular has created many problems in the proper management of patients. Annex 17.

Morphine remains the gold standard for pain relief, intra-operatively as well as pre- and post-operatively. 3. The use of opioids – morphine and pethidine, but not tramadol – may be severely restricted because of the risk of respiratory depression. ICRC surgical teams use opioids only if nursing staff are sufficient in numbers and trained in patient monitoring, as well as in recognition and treatment of respiratory depression. In practice this will usually mean that post-operative opioids are only used in the recovery ward or intensive care unit (ICU). 4. Do not mix opioids (e.g. tramadol and morphine) until an appropriate time has lapsed. 5. In the emergency room, operating theatre and recovery area/ICU, the preferred route for opioid administration is intravenous. If they are used in the ward, the oral or subcutaneous routes are preferred. 6.

{"text": "\n## Respiratory depression\n\n 1. Diagnosis Respiratory depression is diagnosed by: – sedation score of 3: this is the earliest and most reliable sign; – respiratory rate 8 or less: this comes later than sedation; – decreasing pO 2 , as shown by pulse oximetry: this is a late sign especially if the patient is also being given oxygen. 2. Treatment: - oxygen; – respiratory assistance with bag and mask if necessary; – naloxone i.v. in 50 mcg increments until clinical signs improve. Remember that the duration of action of naloxone is shorter than morphine and therefore it may need to be repeated; alternatively, use a continuous infusion of 1 – 5 mcg/kg/hr.

Do not wait for the pain to be felt, but start immediately once the patient has regained consciousness. This also means that analgesia should be started before spinal anaesthesia has worn off. 3. Start with combination treatment and decrease doses in subsequent days. 4. Review post-operative analgesia regularly. 5. Use local anaesthetic infiltration or blocks as much as possible.

{"text": "\n##  ICRC EXPERIENCE\n\n Afghan colleagues working with ICRC surgical teams in the Jalalabad Teaching Hospital in 1993 developed a simple protocol for dealing with patients severely injured by anti-personnel landmines. Many patients had suffered a traumatic amputation of one leg and severe injuries to the other and succumbed, exsanguinated, by the time the debridement of the second leg had been performed. Our Afghan colleagues then decided to divide the surgical procedure into two parts: the first operation was on the traumatic amputation, the other leg was simply washed and dressed, and the operation ended. Fresh whole blood was sought from family members and the patient fully resuscitated and given penicillin. Forty-eight hours later, another operation to debride the second leg was performed. This was Afghan “damage control surgery”, locally invented, to face the situation of a lack of blood for transfusion. Shortly after a war surgery seminar in Kinshasa, two young Congolese general practitioners belonging to the military medical services, with limited surgical expertise, told the ICRC surgeon of one of their experiences and asked a simple question. While working in a field hospital in the bush, they received a comrade with a bullet injury to the abdomen. Evacuation to another hospital was impossible. They operated and found a severe wound to the liver, and had no blood for transfusion. “We couldn’t stop the bleeding, and not knowing what to do, we packed the liver and stopped the operation\", they recounted. They then managed to persuade some other soldiers to donate several units of blood, and re-operated the patient after 48 hours; the patient survived. “Did we do the right thing?” they asked. The ICRC surgeon replied that they had discovered on their own what was now standard practice in many parts of the world when faced with exsanguinating haemorrhage."}
{"text": "\n## 18.1.1   Damage control: three-stage protocol\n\n Recently, it has become clear that fixing the tissues and organs during a long operation is not sufficient if certain physiological limits are thereby exceeded. In response, a three-stage protocol for \"damage control surgery\" 1 has been defined to preclude the risk of pushing the patient beyond those limits into the “lethal triad” of hypothermia, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy that follows much major trauma. First stage: Operation, as short as possible, to control haemorrhage and contamination: do the least to overcome life-threatening conditions. Second stage: Resuscitation, to stabilize the patient by correction of shock, hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy. Third stage: \"Damage control\" is originally a United States Navy term denoting \"the capacity of a ship to absorb damage and maintain mission integrity\". In surgery, we mean the procedures necessary to maintain the physiological capacity to maintain life's vital functions. WAR SURGERY The success of this formalized protocol depends almost entirely on the early recognition that the injury is so severe as to require a curtailment of the initial operation; and, especially, the second-stage capacity to correct certain physiological parameters in the intensive care unit (ICU). Damage control surgery is obviously restricted to the very severely injured, a small minority. It is a much individualized form of management requiring many resources, and may not be compatible with a situation of triage of mass casualties. A patient, who would qualify for damage control in a civilian context or in a military one with a small number of casualties, will in many cases be triaged into the expectant \"supportive treatment\" Category IV in a war scenario that has resulted in a mass influx of wounded. In much of the world, sophisticated ICUs and blood components are simply not available and a full-scale damage-control approach is not compatible with limited resources. However, basic principles apply and simple measures can and must be adapted to try to prevent and correct the syndrome of the lethal triad. In the two examples cited above, the time between operations – used to obtain fresh whole blood from family and friends and \"stabilize\" the patient – helped to fight hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy without knowing it. Attention was paid oly to the haemodynamics and the comfort of the patient (keeping him warm), but this was sufficient to overcome the triad. What started as a \"resuscitative surgery\" approach became a \"damage control\" one unknowingly. Figure 18.1 Figure 18.2 Figure 18.3 Typical patient who would benefit from a damage control approach: eventration and a shattered liver. Another candidate for damage control surgery: APM injury with penetrating wounds to the abdomen, thorax, left thigh and hand, and the face. Figure 18.3 Patient with APM blast mine injury: traumatic amputation of the left foot, penetrating injuries and burns to both legs, the perineum and genitalia, with penetration of the abdomen."}
{"text": "\n## 18.2  Hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy\n\n The effects of hypothermia in trauma patients have long been underestimated. It afflicts the injured even in tropical climates. While metabolic acidosis due to shock – the anaerobic metabolism resulting from reduced tissue perfusion and hypoxia – and coagulopathy are better known, the combined triad is far more prevalent than is often realized and its effects easily fatal. These three elements compound and reinforce each other, leading to a self-sustaining vicious circle. Haemorrhagic shock may not be corrected until hypothermia is reversed, and hypothermia can provoke the other two elements of the triad and is probably the most important factor initiating the vicious circle. Early diagnosis is essential but simple preventive measures, that should be initiated during first aid and evacuation and continued in the hospital, are often not taken. Even if the context does not allow for staged damage control surgery, a great deal can be done with adequate but appropriate means to prevent or fight off the effects of the triad.

{"text": "\n## 18.2.1 Hypothermia\n\n \n## Physiology\n\n The body's temperature is kept in a homeostatic balance between heat production and heat loss. There are many non-traumatic causes and factors that can lead to hypothermia; cold injuries were discussed in Chapter 16. In trauma patients, haemorrhagic shock decreases tissue perfusion and metabolism and thus heat production. This is often compounded by exposure of the casualty to the elements, particularly in a context of armed conflict."}
{"text": "\n## lt should be taken as a general rule that every injured person will lose body heat, even in a tropical climate.\n\n Hypothermia is determined by central body – core – temperature, taken per rectum. A normal medical thermometer is useless; a special low-reading one beginning at 30° C is necessary. Classically, a core temperature below 35° C denotes hypothermia and medical classifications reach profound states of 25° C or less (immersion in a cold lake, hypothalamic disorders, drug abuse, etc.). Some patients suffering from severe hypothermia do survive. There are also reported beneficial effects of controlled therapeutic hypothermia in certain critical pathologies, but this topic shall not be"}
{"text": "\n## Pathology\n\n It is very rare for patients suffering trauma and uncontrolled hypothermia lower than 32° C to survive. This observation is not new, although the threshold has changed."}
{"text": "\n## “It has been said that any wounded man in a state of\n\n stupor whose temperature sinks below 36° C will die.\" In modern practice, the temperature of 32° C is recognized as the crucial cut-off point. All enzyme systems in the body are temperature dependent and, therefore, all organ systems will tend to fail at this low core temperature, especially if stress is accentuated by trauma and shock. Thus, medical classification systems of hypothermia with wide ranges of temperature are not suitable for the trauma patient. A more appropriate classification system has been proposed (Table 18.1), and takes into account the profound effects of trauma and haemorrhage with concomitant acidosis and coagulopathy. In the trauma patient, any temperature below 36° C should be considered hypothermic and it is particularly important to distinguish between Stage I and Stage II. A damage-control approach, with abbreviated first operation as mentioned above, is indicated at 34° C, General medical classification Trauma classification 3° − 35° 0 l Mild 35° – 32° C l 3° – 32° 0 Moderate 3° – 28° ( lll 32° – 28° 0 20 – 200 IV Severe < 28° 0 Profound < 20° C Table 18.1 Classification systems of hypothermia. 3 Delorme E.

Hypothermia and the trauma patient. Can J Surg 1999; 42: 333 – 343. WAR SURGERY The clinical effects of hypothermia are multiple and mimic intense sympathetic stimulation: • shivering – the patient attempts to produce body heat by these muscular contractions but this leads to increased oxygen consumption and tissue hypoxia; • hypoventilation – leads to postoperative hypoxaemia, with further tissue hypoxia; • peripheral vasoconstriction – to shunt blood to the central organs, with tissue hypoxia; • decreased oxygen liberation in the tissues (O, dissociation curve shifted to the left); • decreased metabolism. Furthermore, the tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia of shock in the trauma patient also increase anaerobic metabolism. All of which result in a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis. Enzyme failure results in compromised platelet function; platelet-fibrin clots are not ssstained; and fibrinolytic activity is increased. There is dramatic prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT)."}
{"text": "\n## Please note:\n\n Prolonged PT and PTT may be overlooked because the testing is performed at 37° C rather than at the patient’s actual temperature. There is in addition a rapid drop in the number of platelets and increased blood viscosity following shock. The end result is a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with a marked bleeding tendency. Other physiological effects include: • decreased immune response; • hyporeflexia and prolonged action of neuro-muscular blockers; • reduced cardiac output, depressed myocardial contractility and bradycardia; • arrhythmias, including atrial and ventricular fibrillation, which begin at 30° C; • impaired hepatic and renal function; • impaired cerebral blood flow with decreasing consciousness."}
{"text": "\n## Clinical picture\n\n Early signs include shivering and tremors; the patient first complains of cold then becomes confused. There is cyanosis and the axilla and groin (normally warm spots) feel cold to the touch because of intense vasoconstriction. Tachycardia and tachypnoea (with hypoventilation) occur. All are signs of sympathetic stimulation. Making the diagnosis of hypothermia is a challenge because most of the early signs are the normal physiological response to the stress of trauma and haemorrhage; the surgeon should be particularly attentive to the presence of shivering and tremors. It is also difficult to judge clinically when the patient passes from Stage I to II without As the patient goes into Stage III, there is a general slowing down of all the vital functions: • loss of shivering and hyporeflexia; • respiratory and circulatory depression; • decreased urine output; • increasing acidosis; • prolonged clotting time; • stupor; and, With even greater hypothermia the patient becomes unconscious; bradycardia and bradypnoea are pronounced; urine output fails; and ventricular fibrillation resistant to defibrillation occurs. The patient may appear dead: no palpable pulse or heart beat and dilated pupils. Re-warming should continue until a core temperature of at least 3° C before pronouncing death. DAMAGE CONTROL SURGERY"}
{"text": "\n## High risk cases\n\n At high risk of developing post-traumatic hypothermia are patients who have: • been severely injured and are submitted to a long delay in evacuation to hospital; • remained trapped under rubble (earthquake, collapsed buildings due to bombing, etc.), and thus been exposed to the environment without being able to take protective measures for a considerable period of time; • sustained major burns; intravenous perfusions or cold transfusions – banked blood is stored at 4° C and its administration acts as a heat sink that withdraws large amounts of body heat; • been subjected to long, extensive laparotomy or thoracotomy in air-conditioned operating theatres – the surgeon and anaesthetist are comfortable, but the patient is dying; • suffer from chronic illnesses involving metabolism, alcoholism, and drug abuse; and • the very young and very old, in general."}
{"text": "\n## Please note:\n\n These high risk factors are partly intrinsic to the patient and partly iatrogenic."}
{"text": "\n## Management\n\n Treatment begins with active measures of prevention during first aid and evacuation: the casualty must be kept warm! The patient must be sheltered from cold and wind, relieved of wet clothing, and covered with a dry blanket or sheet, even in a tropical climate. In hospital, active preventive measures must continue: the emergency room should be kept thermo-neutral (28° C for an adult) and, after the patient has been undressed, examined, and resuscitative measures begun, covered with a blanket. For the severely injured, further environmental measures should continue. In the operating theatre, air-conditioning should be turned off (the OT should be heated if necessary), and prolonged contact with wet drapes avoided. The impact of the latter should not be underestimated: the patient starts off dry and warm and ends up wet and hypothermic."}
{"text": "\n## A patient shivering on the operating table is a clear warning sign! \n\n Under muscle relaxant anaesthesia, a patient can no longer shiver and is particularly at risk. Since 20 – 30% of body heat is lost through the head and neck, keeping these body parts warm is a priority (e.g. wrapping the head in a towel and plastic bag intra-operatively). The rest of the body, apart from the operative site, can equally be wrapped in dry towels and secured with plastic bags to preserve heat. Warm saline should be used for peritoneal or pleural lavage. Operating time should be kept as short as possible; an open abdomen or thorax inevitably entails loss of body heat Administered oxygen should be humidified – a heat and moisture exchange filter (HME) should be used, if available – and intravenous fluids and blood transfusions warmed. Fluids and blood can be heated by being placed in a tub of hot water, comfortable to an elbow touch. All of these simple measures, which do not require  sophisticated equipment, should be standard procedure in all surgical patients, especially those suffering Not only will these simple measures prevent hypothermia, but their early implementation will help treat the condition. WAR SURGERY If a damage-control approach is being used, or even if a major trauma case presents signs of hypothermia postoperatively, resuscitation should include active internal “central heating” of the patient by: • gastric, colonic and bladder lavage with warm water (37 – 39° C); and • continued perfusion of similarly warm i.v. fluids. More sophisticated technologies exist – including extracorporeal circulation, pleural and peritoneal lavage in the ICU – but the vast majority of patients will be well served by these simple and inexpensive preventive and active measures. A patient in Stage I hypothermia may have definitive surgery completed. A Stage I patient should have damage control surgery only. If Stages III or IV have been reached, damage control surgery may be slightly postponed in order to warm the patient somewhat before opening the peritoneum or pleura, but this will depend on the particular circumstance and haemodynamic stability of the individual patient. Again: rare is the haemorrhaging trauma patient with a core temperature below 32° C  who survives, however good the surgery. Type of measures Applicability Procedures Standard measures Passive external warming (warm Standard measures are applicable for environment, blankets and covers) + all Stages and at all times warmed intravenous fluids + warmed and humidified oxygen Active external warming Electric blankets Particularly suitable for ICU/ emergency room Environmental heater Active internal warming Irrigation of pleural/peritoneal cavity with Should be routine surgical procedure intraoperatively warm saline during surgery Active internal warming Warm gastric, colonic, and bladder lavage Particularly suitable for ICU postoperatively Warm pleural/peritoneal lavage if feasible Table 18.2 Summary of management of hypothermia in the trauma patient."}
{"text": "\n## 18.2.2 Acidosis\n\n As mentioned, shock will lead to tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia with a subsequent rise in anaerobic metabolism. This acidosis is compounded by the effects of hypothermia. Full resuscitation and haemodynamic stability in a warm patient, assuring good tissue perfusion, is the best antidote. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate is risky and requires sophisticated monitoring."}
{"text": "\n## 18.2.3   Acute coagulopathy associated with trauma\n\n Post-traumatic coagulopathy is also more common than realized and results from a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Amongst the intrinsic ones, the most important include: • extensive tissue injury, which releases tissue factors resulting in consumption coagulopathy (with reduced platelet count), excessive fibrinolysis, and activation of  inflammatory cascade; • activation of the C-reactive protein inflammatory cascade independently of the release of tissue factors and entirely due to the shocked state and tissue hypoperfusion; • haemodilution resulting from the mobilization of extravascular fluids as a homeostatic response to shock; • decrease in the total and ionized calcium concentrations; and • the effects of progressive hypothermia and acidosis. The severity of the coagulopathy seems to parallel the severity of injury and shock. DAMAGE CONTROL SURGERY Important factors resulting in post-traumatic coagulopathy: • tissue damage • shock: hypoperfusion and homeostatic haemodilution • hypothermia • acidosis • inflammation • therapeutic haemodilution with i.v. fluid resuscitation There are also a number of extrinsic factors. Coagulopathy itself is often exacerbated by clinical practice in a \"bloody vicious cycle\". 4 Haemorrhagic shock is aggressively treated with large volumes of intravenous fluids (not warmed), leading to further haemodilution, and massive transfusion of stored blood or packed RBCs (not warmed) in the attempt to maintain blood pressure (see Chapter 8); all of which adversely affect the coagulation cascade and only produce more bleeding. Bleeding and coagulation times remain prolonged despite adequate replacement of blood, plasma and platelets if the patient remains hypothermic. It must also be remembered that the anticoagulant preservative solution and refrigeration of stored blood or its components has profound effects on the physiological properties of transfused blood with time, the most important being greatly reduced oxygen availability to the tissues through decreased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) and loss of red cell viability because of decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP). These effects do not help overcome early tissue hypoxia in spite of the increase in haemoglobin. In addition, the glucose in stored blood is slowly metabolized with production of lactate and fall in the pH, exacerbating the acidosis. Warm whole blood, as fresh as possible, is probably the best treatment; and, as often repeated in this manual, in conditions of limited resources is often all that is available. With numerous potential donors (family and friends), it may be possible to build up a small reserve. Whole blood is screened and best given within 1 hour of collection. In ICRC practice, this freshest of blood is reserved for: • massive haemorrhage, with incipient coagulopathy and hypothermia; • septic shock; • snake bites with haemolysis; • amniotic fluid embolism. Intravenous calcium should be administered, separately and at least one ampoule added per two units of blood transfused. Coagulopathy also attends many patients with severe head injury, and a damage control approach is applicable to injuries to most body systems.
