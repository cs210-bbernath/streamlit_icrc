"a health status that conforms to norms reflecting local conditions. EMHIs are not directly related to satisfactory social and economic development. In fact, EMHIs are usually artificially based: financial, logistic, technical, and managerial supports 14 are usually external, particularly when the implementation of the programs has no connection whatsoever with the local authorities. The danger with EMHIs is that they are apt to leave nothing behind when they and the outside aid come to an end. In this sense, PHC and EMHIs are different. The two approaches use a similar strategy, however. Access to health services must be as broad and as easy as possible, and the emphasis is on preventive measures."
