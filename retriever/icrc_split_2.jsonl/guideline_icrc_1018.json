"# Role\nUp to 1990, UNHCR fulfilled its mandate to guarantee the protection of refugee populations and to find permanent solutions to their situation. Since then, its mandate has been expanded to include action to prevent refugee movements. As a result, UNHCR may be obliged to intervene in conflict situations on behalf of civilian populations who are victims of the hostilities, whether they have remained in their original homes or have had to flee and are displaced."
