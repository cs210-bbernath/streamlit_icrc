"They provide slightly lower values than the table below (the difference does not exceed 5%). # FOOD ISSUE IN RELIEF FOOD DONATION POLICY\n\n# A) Introduction\nFood supplies are frequently part of Red Cross response to emergencies. However, it is essential in each situation to fi rst establish that food supply is a correct response and then that the composition is defi ned and described after an adequate comprehensive survey. In every instance it is necessary to ensure that food donations are culturally and nutritionally appropriate for the affected population and that the costs of their purchase, transportation, storage and distribution is kept to a minimum. Food which is inappropriate for whatever reason causes suffering for the victims of the disaster, embarrassment and frustration for those responsible for their distribution and brings well-earned discredit on the agency responsible for the donation. Thus it is the ICRC/League's responsibility to ensure as far as possible that any appeal for food assistance is both necessary and appropriate before sharing that appeal with National Societies and other donors. The ICRC/League in coordination with other relevant agencies are also responsible for establishing the energy and nutrient content of the rations, indicating the suitable food items to achieve this. They must also ensure that the response is in line with policy and that distributions of each donation are carried out fairly, effi ciently and economically. All offers of food assistance must be cleared by ICRC/League and accepted by the operating Society. # B) General principles\n1. Foods should be appropriate to the benefi ciaries to: q meet nutritional needs; q maintain traditional food habits; q avoid waste and large scale sale on black markets; q economize on scarce fuel; q avoid creation of new tastes; q avoid dependency on external food resources; q avoid disruption of local markets. 2. Local knowledge on each emergency situation will be the basis for the establishment of the food ration. Together with the National Society, a comprehensive survey should be carried out to ascertain the present nutritional status of the affected population, and if possible, the previous level, as well as to establish food requirements suitable in both type and amount. Other local relevant agencies should always be consulted and contact should be established with local nutritional expertise."
