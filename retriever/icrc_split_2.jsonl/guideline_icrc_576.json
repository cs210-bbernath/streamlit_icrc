"If preliminary information received from the triage team warrants it, reinforcements may be requested (off-duty personnel). # Preparing the Equipment\nEvery surgical unit should have emergency reserves permitting it to cope with large numbers of casualties, at least for a few days. This equipment must be prepared in advance, so that each type of item is immediately available. As at all levels of medical care, standardized equipment guarantees efficiency during emergencies. # Preparing Medical Services\nA certain number of measures should be taken by the services directly involved in treating casualties. The operating bloc must be cleared and ready to go as soon as the first casualties arrive; the staff in charge of the blood bank must make sure that blood reserves are adequate. In wartime conditions, such as those in which the ICRC works, 25% of the wounded receive transfusions; each of them receives approximately three units of blood. The intensive-care ward should transfer all patients whose condition permits to other wards."
