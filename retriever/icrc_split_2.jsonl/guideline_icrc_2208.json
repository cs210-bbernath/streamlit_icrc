"and the compatibility of the latter with the recipients' possibilities. From a nutritional perspective, all cereals are understood as being equivalent, so are legumes, and so are fats and oils. Oil may be partly replaced with sugar or oilseeds based on calorie equivalents, but Foodstuffs that supply macro-nutrients also contain signifi cant amounts of micro-nutrients, but not all such foodstuffs contain all micro-nutrients, or in suffi cient amounts. Several means exist to ensure comprehensive micro-nutrient supply, but none is entirely satisfactory unless varied (even fortifi ed if necessary) foods are provided in the form of meals. Needless to say, this is diffi cult to do in GFDs. On the other hand, several methods permit the best possible supply of micro-nutrients, and the commonest are discussed below."
