"-if the question causes diffi culty, it must be rephrased. \n# General aspects of assessment methods\n3.3 Data collection 9Open-ended questions should be preferred to leading questions. For example, \"how do you see the situation?\" is preferable to \"is the situation bad?\" 9 Questions should be kept short and simple, especially if translation is required. If it is, the translation must be literal. If informants appear not to have understood, wording and meanings must be verifi ed with them. For example, a word as common as \"food\", when translated into the vernacular, has proven on occasion to have more complex meaning, causing serious misunderstandings."
