"exclusively reserved for non-combatants whose vital needs are not covered. In practice, it is difficult to separate the civilians from the armed groups. Aid can be planned according to the number of civilians targeted. Some of the aid will probably go to armed groups, and the civilians' vital needs may not be covered. If the armed group is included in the intervention program, the aid providers are deliberately contributing to the war effort. One way of getting around this problem is to minimize the aid's attraction for combatants; for example, relief workers could replace food distributions with meal distributions, as was done in Somalia."
