"this observation, with mortality drops of the order of 30%. These distributions appear to have a greater effect on mortality related to measles and diarrhoea than to respiratory infection. Studies on the reduction of mortality through the distribution of vitamin A do not associate the relative mortality risk and xerophthalmia, probably because of the weak prevalence of clinical xerophthalmia. The impact on mortality is more probably due to sub-clinical vitamin A defi ciency. Worldwide, 1 to 2.5 million deaths per annum are attributed to vitamin A defi ciency; severe malnutrition is an associated factor in approximately 50% of cases. However, the administration of zinc reduces mortality through diarrhoeal disease concurrent with vitamin A defi ciency by 25%."
