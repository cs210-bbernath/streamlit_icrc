"The analysis of Table 10.1 invites the following observations. Gathering varies like agriculture, which is logical in drought; the labour supply is inelastic; social obligations do not vary according to the severity of crisis; petty trade is not a seriously considered option (possibly because resorting to it signals economic diffi culty, and thus promotes speculation); this population does not rely heavily on credit. These observations must then be verifi ed in the light of the real potential of each option."
