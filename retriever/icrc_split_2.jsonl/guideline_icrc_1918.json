"in initial treatment, and is often ascribed to lactose intolerance. 28 There are three types of lactose intolerance: intolerance associated with digestive atrophy in the severely malnourished or patients suffering from digestive disorder, intolerance resulting from the suspension of milk consumption in weaned infants, adolescents, and adults, and intolerance related to a congenital inability to synthesise lactase (lactose digestion enzyme). The fi rst two types in fact combine with diarrhoea, and disappear quickly in all age groups during initial treatment. The third type is irreversible, and requires a completely lactose-free diet. It is however very rare, because subjects who suffer from it usually die young since they are unable to digest maternal milk -unless parents can secure suitable substitution formulae."
