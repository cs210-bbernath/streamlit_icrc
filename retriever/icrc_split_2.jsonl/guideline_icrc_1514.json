"GFD implementation 3.2 Setting rations\nThe above hazards often coincide. The selection of most appropriate responses implies that operating agencies can predict the duration and degree of abnormality, and its possible deterioration until the access to food of the affected groups returns to normal. With respect to duration, the following must then be appraised:\n9 the resilience of affected groups (i.e. what they still possess, what they can still utilize, with what consequences); 9 the harm already caused by the current situation; 9 the anticipated harm; 9 the time required for resources mobilization in order to assist affected groups. The foodstuffs that complement rations must not necessarily exactly replace the foods that are lacking, or those that are unfamiliar or can only be obtained at excessive cost. The conditions prevailing on local markets must be taken into account, as must the anticipated impact of the distribution of a given commodity on its local price and availability. In a crisis, basic foods are often those that are most scarce and, thus, most expensive. Their distribution in suffi cient amounts may therefore improve access to other food commodities, either by lowering their price, or by permitting their exchange."
