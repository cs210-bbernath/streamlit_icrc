"analysed and commented in order to avoid sometimes serious misunderstandings. For example, the 70% weight-for-height cut-off point (or -3 Z-scores) is more relevant as a criterion for admission into therapeutic feeding centres than as a threshold for the analysis of the overall nutritional status in a public health perspective, because it is both severe and specifi c. However, the current tendency is to consider only individuals that fall below this threshold when qualifying the severity of the nutritional situation in the overall population. From a public health angle, cut-off points must be selected in order to appraise the situation more sensitively, and to measure changes occurring over short periods of time in order to determine whether they are signifi cant or not."
