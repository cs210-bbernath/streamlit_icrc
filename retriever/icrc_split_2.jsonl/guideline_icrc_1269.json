"not shy away from physical threats to achieve their ends. Here again, open dialogue is required to understand the nature of the relationship, and for humanitarian agencies to demonstrate that they intend to abide by their guiding principles. Parting on friendly terms may in fact be a convenient outcome for all involved, and is usually preferable to a showdown. Substituting local services and organizations is a major problem in humanitarian action, because international agencies are increasingly accused of exploiting them and leaving little (if anything) behind when the operation is over. Humanitarian imperialism is still all too common. However, if outside support is required it is because local means have failed."
