"expresses the result in the form of a numerical value. The magnitude of this value depends on the degree of difference between the values mentioned above. Empirically, the greater the chi-squared value, the greater the probability that the populations are different. If, for example, the chi-squared value is 3.841, the probability of error is 5%, and the two populations are affirmed to be different. The chi-squared value reaches 6.635 for an error rate of 1%, and so on. There are tables to determine, on the basis of the chi-squared value and the degree of freedom, 41 the probability of an erroneous rejection of the null hypothesis."
