"Such projects are realistic only if the community agrees they are justified and is willing to maintain them in the long term. # Volcanoes\nThe vulnerability associated with volcanoes is not limited to actual eruptions, which certainly entail human losses but whose consequences in the long term are not as great as those engendered by the constitution of pyroclastic deposits (lahar). 52 These may upset the hydrological balance in the region. To these effects must be added the destruction of infrastructure such as bridges, which are swept away by the flood of pyroclastic deposits. In the long run, the number of people affected by this imbalance is much greater than the number of victims directly affected by the initial volcanic eruption."
