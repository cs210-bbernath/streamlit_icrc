In every instance it is necessary to ensure that food donations are culturally and nutritionally appropriate for the affected population and that the costs of their purchase, transportation, storage and distribution is kept to a minimum. Food which is inappropriate for whatever reason causes suffering for the victims of the disaster, embarrassment and frustration for those responsible for their distribution and brings well-earned discredit on the agency responsible for the donation. Thus it is the ICRC/League's responsibility to ensure as far as possible that any appeal for food assistance is both necessary and appropriate before sharing that appeal with National Societies and other donors."
