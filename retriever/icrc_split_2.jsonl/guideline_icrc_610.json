"For example, the anthropometric measurements of weight for height and weight for age are used to detect conditions of severe malnutrition. Weight-for-height, however, is used to measure acute severe malnutrition, while weight-for-age can indicate both acute and chronic severe malnutrition. For this reason, the results obtained with the weight-for-age method are not representative of a problem of severe acute malnutrition which arises abruptly during a disaster. # Choice of Variables for Interpreting Indicator Variations\n\n# Validity\nThe validity of a test is characterized by two properties, sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is defined as ''the proportion of true positives correctly identified by a test,'' while specificity is defined as ''the proportion of true negatives correctly identified by a test.'' 9 The positive predictive value (PPV) of a test expresses the probability that an individual declared positive by the test actually has the disease. # Implications for Emergency Situations\nIn a region heavily infested with malaria, there is a danger that anyone showing up at the local clinic with a headache will be considered to be suffering an attack of malaria, if the indicator sought is the patient's complaint of ''headaches.'' For greater exactitude, a more specific indicator must be used, such as fever (measured with a thermometer) and a positive blood test (analyzed in the laboratory). 10 The first indicator covers most cases of malaria and is therefore highly sensitive, but a number of cases thereby labeled as ''malaria'' are not actually malaria, meaning that this indicator has a weak positive predictive value. If fever (temperature higher than 37.5 o C) is taken as an indicator, the tendency will be towards a reduction of the proportion of negative cases labeled as positive by the first indicator (better specificity). At the same time, however, sensitivity will decline, in that a large proportion of genuine malaria cases will be labeled as not having the disease."
