"& Psychological problems Disasters give rise to psychological reactions during the event itself or after a variable lapse of time. These reactions include, for example, anxiety, depression, sleeping disorders, and alcoholism. Refugee or displaced populations are particularly vulnerable to psychosocial disorders, because of the social upheavals involved in the move itself, overcrowding, and, more generally, the reorganization of the social system, as well as the uncertainty of the future. Children are the most vulnerable, and this aspect of their health has become a major concern over the last few years: ''Refugee children's psychological well-being is as important as their physical health. The term 'psychosocial well-being' is used to reflect the intimate relationship between psychological and social factors.'' 4 In short, in emergency situations the types of medical problems are more or less the same as in normal situations; only their prevalence and seriousness change. # Prevalence and Seriousness of Medical Problems\nSeveral factors contribute to the increased prevalence and seriousness of medical problems in emergencies. Prevalence is usually a function of nutritional status, environment, and the deterioration of preventive services. One of the main reasons for the potentially greater number of serious problems in an emergency is that access to medical services is impaired, particularly in conflict situations. Owing to a lack of immediate care, such diseases as meningitis and cerebral malaria are likely to prove fatal. The combination of prevalence and seriousness leads to high mortality. This idea can be formulated as follows: Prevalence 6 Seriousness = Mortality Access to Medical Care Thus, the high prevalence of medical problems, the large number of serious cases, and the reduced access to health-care services all help explain the particularly high mortality rates found among displaced populations before an intervention takes effect. As an example, M. Toole has noted that in the refugee camps in Sudan, Ethiopia, and Thailand the mortality rate was 18 to 45 times greater than among the population of the host country. The establishment of health-care facilities is a priority in such situations. 5 \n\n# Care Providers\nCare providers can be divided into two groups:\n-providers of non-professional care; -health-care professionals. # Providers of Non-Professional Care\nCertain activities related to medical care are directly performed by people within the household (mother, grandmother, neighbor, etc.). 6 The knowledge possessed by these caregivers may be empirical (based on what has always been done for a given medical problem) or technical (derived from health-education programs). This category also includes traditional doctors and midwives, for they have received training -usually of an informal nature, of course, but which reflects the lore of generations. The social role played by this category of personnel varies from one culture to another, as does the nature of the problems they treat. This course will not examine traditional therapeutic methods in detail, but students should remember that traditional medicine is part of the organization of a health system, just as modern medicine is. Community health workers (CHWs) fall into this category as well, although in some cases they may have had several months' training. # Health-Care Professionals\nHealth-care professionals consist mainly in nursing personnel, doctors, specialists, and paramedical personnel such as pharmacists and laboratory assistants. Curative and preventive measures will be discussed in Chapter 7 (''The Health-Care System'')."
