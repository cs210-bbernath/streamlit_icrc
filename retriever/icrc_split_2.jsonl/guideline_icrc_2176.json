"and measuring other anthropometric variables such as weight and height. However, creating such calendars is not simple and takes time; therefore, the value of the information relating to age must be such as to justify the effort involved. As a last resort, Bailey suggests the following method: adding 6 to the number of visible teeth (whose crown is entirely visible) provides a reasonable approximation of the child's age in months (Bailey, 1963). This method is simple, and easy to remember. \n# Weight\nWeight must be established to evaluate ponderal growth and corpulence. The measurement of weight provides an approximation of nutritional reserves; but the measurement of weight involves measuring the entire organism, including: 9 intestinal parasites, which may be likened to antimatter because they are counted as nutritional reserves when they, in fact, consume part of the food and nutritional reserves; the burden of intestinal worms can exceed 1 kg; 9 sub-clinical oedema, which is an accumulation of fl uid; 9 abnormal liver and spleen enlargement (hepatomegaly and splenomegaly) -splenomegaly is particularly common where malaria is endemic; 9 non-oedematous fl uid accumulation associated with infection and infl ammation (parasite infl ammation can double the weight of the intestine); 9 body waste that has not yet been excreted."
