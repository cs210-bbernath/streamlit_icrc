Subsequent investigation provides prevalence rates that usually differ somewhat from expected rates; likewise, actual sample size may differ from expectations. As a result, confi dence intervals probably differ slightly from those used to calculate sample size, and must be corrected for the appropriate expression of results. In simple, systematic and stratifi ed random sampling, the formula used to calculate accuracy is the following: accuracy = \u00b1 \u03b5 \u00d7  1/2\nWhere: \u03b5 = 1.96, the factor determining the sampling error at 5% p = the actual prevalence rate n = the actual sample size. In the example used earlier, the factor determining sampling error was 1.96, the sample size was 246 for a 5% sampling error with \u00b1 5% accuracy, and the expected prevalence rate was 20%. Assuming that actual values are in fact as follows:\np = the actual prevalence rate = 35% n = the actual sample size = 220. Then actual accuracy is the following: accuracy = \u00b1 1.96 \u00d7  1/2 = \u00b1 6.3%\nThe fi nal result is thus 35 \u00b1 6.3%, the actual accuracy being \u00b1 6.3% and not \u00b1 5% as suggested by the initially chosen accuracy. In cluster random sampling, the formula used to obtain actual accuracy is not determined by sample size, but by the differences in results from different clusters. The resulting formula is the following:\naccuracy = \u00b1 \u03b5 \u00d7 {\u03a3 i = 1 to k (p i -p) 2 / } 1/2\nWhere: p = the actual overall prevalence rate in the entire sample, say 30.1% k = the total number of clusters included in the sample, say 5 i = a given cluster within the overall sample (numbered 1 to k) p i = the actual prevalence rate in cluster i n = the actual sample size = 220 \u03a3 = the sum of all values\nIf the results obtained from the 5 clusters in the sample are 28.5%, 24.2%, 33.1%, 27.2% and 30.9%, the sum of (p i -p) 2 is calculated as follows:\nThis then permits the calculation of accuracy itself: accuracy = \u00b1 1.96 \u00d7  1/2 = \u00b1 3.3%\nAnd the fi nal result is then 30.1 \u00b1 3.3%. # General aspects of assessment methods\n3.4 Selecting subjects\n\n# Complete enumeration\nIn some cases, it may be easier and faster to avoid sampling altogether, and observe all subjects within the overall population."
