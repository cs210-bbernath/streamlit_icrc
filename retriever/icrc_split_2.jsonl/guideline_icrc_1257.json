"approach to victims consists mainly in preventing and alleviating suffering. Then local customs must be observed when defi ning the needs and the required assistance. Ethics also require that victims be treated as privileged working partners: participatory practices invite the direct involvement of recipients, and this is the only way of securing their active support. The ethics underlying participatory approaches are those of a real desire to understand different cultures, views, and practices. The above does not invite a naive outlook or the undue idealization of victims: they are human beings, no better, no worse than others and, as such, predators."
