"For example, if a given population must devote most of its time to gathering activities for its survival during the season when it would normally prepare its fi elds for sowing, then these activities are detrimental to the possible recovery of their economic self-suffi ciency. Another approach involves the defi nition of normality in consultation with the affected population, followed by the defi nition of the worst-case and best-case scenarios that this population can recall (the elderly provide invaluable information in this type of enquiry), and the comparison of the results with the observed situation. This also enables the comparison of the crisis at hand with respect to what the population is culturally accustomed to, providing a better idea of its current resilience."
