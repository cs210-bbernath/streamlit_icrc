"Proper work plans are a crucial element of a smooth logistical operation. # Recipient units\nFood can be distributed according to a set number of members per family, a set number of individuals belonging to different grouped families, or on an individual basis. The set number of members per family refl ects average family size, as observed during registration. If the average family size turns out to be four individuals, for example, then four individual rations will be distributed to each family, regardless of its actual size. The set number of individuals per group of families is more arbitrary, and is defi ned on criteria that facilitate distribution. For example, families are grouped in units of twelve individuals each, and an amount corresponding to twelve individual rations is distributed to each of these groups; the latter then reallocate the resulting assistance internally according to actual family size. Set numbers of family members along demographic lines would seem a useful device for operating agencies, as it permits the preparation and distribution of standard rations. It is however not recommended, because it profi ts families that are smaller than average, to the detriment of larger families, without an automatic reallocation of the distributed resources to correct this imbalance. Grouping families according to set numbers of individuals is time-consuming for recipients. If they can agree however, this option can be quite useful and fast (like set family sizes on a demographic basis). Nevertheless, experience shows that individual distribution is usually best. Queues and handover points are organized according to the actual number of family members. As a result, each family receives its exact entitlement."
