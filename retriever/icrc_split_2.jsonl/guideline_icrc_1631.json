"The chosen location must be protected from the general risks prevailing, and its available space must permit extensions if necessary. A centre's layout is determined by the anticipated number of patients, and by access. The number of patients that can be admitted varies according to the magnitude of the problem and the number of TFC that can be opened in a given region. Centres have been known to accommodate between 100 and 1,400 patients. Smaller centres are easier to manage and their atmosphere is usually more relaxed and personal. Still, larger centres may be necessary in disasters, and are just as effi cient as smaller structures, provided that they are adequately staffed. The number of patients determines the TFC layout and the magnitude of its facilities. 9 Access to the TFC is much infl uenced by its location. If the target population is close by and access is easy, there is no need for annexes for the permanent accommodation of patients and their carers (other than during initial treatment, when 24-hour attention is necessary) -this is usually the case in camps for refugees or the displaced, and in towns. If the target population is too distant however, the TFC must include a camp to accommodate patients and their carers, or locate the TFC in a facility that permits such an addition. The permanent presence of patients and carers does not require structural changes, but does require an admission facility, preferably within the centre or in its immediate vicinity, which is fenced in and supervised, equipped with an adequate water supply and disposal system and the means required for food preparation. It is worth insisting here on the need for carers to receive adequate food rations; the comment seems obvious, but carers have all too often been seen to go without food."
