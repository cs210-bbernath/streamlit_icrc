Moreover, if the family does not consume the entire ration, then the lengthy process of setting individual rations would lose its purpose altogether. It is therefore best to defi ne the average nutritional need of the overall target population, according to its demographic distribution, its average level of physical activity (expressed as a multiplication factor of the basal metabolism) and, where relevant, its environment. The number of rations that each household receives is determined by the number of its members; and the amount of food received by each household is usually suffi cient because each household is more or less a microcosm of the overall population."
