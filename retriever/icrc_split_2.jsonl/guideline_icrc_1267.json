"assistance themselves, and to invite their involvement without risking diversion. \n# Unaffected population\nThe unaffected population frequently accommodates displaced persons (hence the expression \"host community\"), and the resulting cost may be such as to cause a need for assistance. In such cases, the motivation to assist the host community should clearly be humanitarian ethics and also common sense. Humanitarian agencies that do so thus apply the principle of reciprocity, and preserve the social peace that discrimination would certainly jeopardize. Moreover, if victims are granted access to healthcare while the host community is not, this imbalance must be corrected -either by extending the access to the local population, or by ensuring that the gap is covered by another agency."
