"In fact, if persuasion meets with success, then prevention is guaranteed to be as effi cient as possible. Even if it fails, it should nevertheless persist: a given right may not apply, strictly speaking, to a given set of circumstances, but its underlying principles may be converted to suit such circumstances, and thus provide the basis for persuasion efforts. Advocacy for the respect of rights must therefore underpin humanitarian action from beginning to end within the crisis process, whether the need for assistance results from deliberate abuse, neglect or incompetence. # POSITION IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION\nWhen the inobservance of rights and/or abusive behaviour causes or contributes to the development of crisis, putting a halt to them is a constant priority in humanitarian action, from the beginning to the end of the crisis process."
