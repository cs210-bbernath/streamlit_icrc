"# II. Primary Health-Care Strategy\nDepending on the way it operates, a health-care system can have a ''big head'' or ''big feet.'' In the first instance, most of the system's resources are channeled into the operation of high-level health-care facilities such as hospitals, while in the second case, the orientation is to decentralize the health-care system towards the periphery, the goal being a better adaptation of health services to the population's needs. The strategy of the first approach is based on the so-called ''trickle-down'' effect, in which resources directed towards the top of the healthcare pyramid are supposed to spread down towards the base. The second approach demands a strategy based on primary health care."
