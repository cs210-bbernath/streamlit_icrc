"are also valid for emergency situations -with, however, variable connotations. \n# Coordination between Services and Population\nThe match between the services offered and the population's needs is based on four principles:\n. decentralization of the health-care services\ncoordination between the systems involved . pyramidal organization of the health-care services\ncoordination between the partners involved. \n# Decentralization of Services\nAs noted earlier, the skills of the care providers, whether family members or medical personnel, must be suited to the tasks they are supposed to perform. This principle works in both directions: on one hand, the civilian health-care systems may not be prepared for difficult medical cases (insufficient skills); on the other, health-care personnel may be performing tasks that could be executed at the lowest levels by people who are medically less qualified but who are closer to the population."
