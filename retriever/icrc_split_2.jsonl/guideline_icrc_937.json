"An internally displaced person is still within the borders of his or her country. Although both categories of people often have very similar needs, their legal protection is quite different and requires separate examination. # Refugee Populations\n\n# Protection in the Host Country\nThe 1951 Convention concerns the rights of refugees within the host country with respect to legal status, employment, education, housing, etc. Article 2 of that convention stipulates that refugees are bound to conform to the laws and regulations of the host country. One of the goals of UNHCR is to ascertain that refugees are being treated in accordance with internationally recognized standards. # Long-Term Solutions\nThree solutions can be envisioned in the long term:\n. repatriation to the country of origin;\n. settlement in the host country;\n\n# resettlementinathirdcountry. Repatriation to the country of origin is the most sensible solution, since it restores refugees to their own sociocultural environment. Repatriation must be voluntary, and it is essential that protective measures be taken, including an assurance that the security conditions that caused the refugees to flee in the first place have been resolved, a guarantee that essential needs can be met as soon as the refugees return home (housing, food, etc.), and, finally, measures to afford refugees some possibility of finding a job again. Settling the refugees in the first host country is also an option, if the security conditions of the country of origin remain uncertain and the host country agrees to integrate the refugees into the local population. ;; ;; ;; @@ @@ @@ ;; ;; ;; @@ @@ @@ ;; ;; ;; @@ @@ @@ ;; ;; ;; @@ @@ @@ ;; ;; ;; @@ @@ @@ ;; ;; ;; QQ QQ QQ ;; ;; @@ @@ ;; ;; @@ @@ ;; ;; @@ @@ ;; ;; @@ @@ ;; ;; @@ @@ ;; ;; QQ QQ\n\n# Movement of refugee populations towards a host country\nThe protection of refugees is based on:\n- The Geneva Convention of 1951 Relating to the Status of Refugees and Its 1967 Protocol containing, in particular, the principle of non-refoulement. - International humanitarian law, which is applicable to refugee populations when the host country is at war with the country of origin, or when the refugees are faced with an armed conflict. # Country of Origin\nHost Country \n\n# Three Long-Term Solutions for Refugee Populations\nMoving them to a third country can be contemplated when the first two solutions are not possible. # Protection of Displaced Persons in their Own Countries\nA slightly different problem involves displaced people still living in their own countries, though not in their own homes:\n''hen civilians are forced to leave their homes owing to serious violations of international humanitarian law, they are still a fortiori protected by this law. This protection may come from the law applicable either to international or to internal conflicts, as both types of conflict may result in displacements of people within their own country.'' 36\nCivilians may be forced to leave their homes for many reasons, the chief of which is undoubtedly armed conflict. Armed conflicts can give rise to two types of displacement: either the civilians are moved by force by the authorities or an armed opposition group, or they flee because of the general spread of violence, for example as a consequence of shelling or famine. In both cases, the displaced persons are protected by humanitarian law. Since most displacements take place during internal armed conflicts, it is the law on internal conflicts that applies: Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol II. In some cases, however, the displacements take place during international conflicts, in which case humanitarian law in its entirety applies. Humanitarian law protects internally displaced persons as members of the civilian population, which benefits from comprehensive immunity against the effects of the hostilities. Protocol II prohibits attacks against civilians."
