"A certain number of medical tasks can be performed by non-professional personnel, as long as they have been properly trained to do them. Training programs have been instituted in most of the situations involving displaced or refugee populations. This type of training provides the basis for an effective teaching program for CHWs. 27 \n\n# Advantages of Standardization in Terms of the Stages of the Caregiving Process\n\n# Professional Tasks\nThe approach described above is also appropriate for training CHWs in emergency situations. The preceding sections discussed the most urgent health problems and the necessity of defining and standardizing the professional tasks that have to be done. It was shown that CHWs may have to deal with patients suffering from fever, skin lesions, coughs, etc. Their training may permit them to identify these ailments. At the next stage, they must be able to diagnose the cause of the fever or other symptom -malaria, respiratory infections, etc. -and to treat it. Choosing the level of skill that will be required of a health worker depends on the role the CHWs are expected to play in the health-care system. Should it be limited to screening cases of fever, or does it include the responsibility of making a diagnosis and providing treatment? This choice will determine which professional tasks CHWs should be able to perform. In an emergency situation, they must be quickly trained for specific tasks, such as taking anthropometric measurements, treating cases of scabies, and preparing rehydration solutions. In general, manpower is not limited, and CHWs can be speedily trained for a specific, 29 high-priority task. Later on, these tasks will be diversified so that they can be integrated into the more general framework of an activity."
