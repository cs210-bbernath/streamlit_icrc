"crisis is still latent, or if its effects are unobtrusive. Precisely at this stage, results must be cross-checked. \n# Identifying the causes of problems\nIdentifying and demonstrating the causes of problems that may result in crisis amounts to clarifying the interaction of phenomena, vulnerabilities, and impacts. This is necessary in order to defi ne the need for assistance, in both time and content. For example, a drought may threaten to cause famine in a given subsistence agriculture area; this threat is likely to disappear during the following rainy season if the latter is normal. As a result, action should persist at least until the following normal harvest, and will consist chiefl y of food and agricultural inputs."
