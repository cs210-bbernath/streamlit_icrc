"the primary role of that food is to provide nutrients. Such action is expected to preserve or improve the nutritional status, that is, to protect or restore the functional capacity of household members. This implies that food rations be adapted to circumstances, and distributed regularly according to plan. In earlier stages of the famine process, during recovery from it, and in the case of groups that have remained in their usual environment, GFD also serves to compensate an insuffi cient economic performance that affects access to food. In such cases, GFD compensates food scarcity where that exists, and also frees time and resources that would otherwise be used to feed the household to the detriment of other basic activities and economic sustainability."
