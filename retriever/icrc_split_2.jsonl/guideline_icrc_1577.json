"Consequently, the thorough checking of cards is of crucial importance. Distribution cards indicate a number, which corresponds to the registration number recorded in the ledger, a code for the number of family members, a code that indicates at what distribution point the card is valid, a code for the registration criterion of the population group the cardholder belongs to, and its last and fi rst names. Cards must also show the logo of the operating agency or, alternatively, that of the agency supplying the food to the distributing agency. # GFD implementation 3.4 Attending to groups\nCards should be made of fl exible but solid plastic, and preferably marked through their thickness in order to complicate forgery. They usually contain two types of information: cardholder details (this part also indicates the pre-printed individual card number), and numbered boxes for different coding purposes and for the tracking of the rations received by the cardholder. It is best to use perforators or punches with unusual patterns for both coding and ration tracking, and the perforators must be kept carefully by the staff in charge of the distribution. Card coding calls for creativity and the key to codes must be recorded in the GFD logbook, which must be accessible to the overall GFD supervisor only. Figure 12.2 below provides an example of card and coding. # Figure 12.2 Distribution card -example\nDistribution rounds may be marked in the second and third row, for example, where box 11 corresponds to round 1, box 12 to round 2, and so on. The numbers corresponding to distribution points, benefi ciary groups, and distribution dates are recorded in the GFD logbook, which also indicates their key. Whatever census and registration method is chosen, cards could be given to all individuals. This would however multiply the risk of abuse, traffi c, sale, and forgery accordingly. If each family or household holds only one card, the motivation is also greater to keep it safely in order to preserve access to food distributions. Moreover, the verifi cation of a single card per family greatly facilitates the GFD itself. Provided that this does not expose them, it is best for women to hold the family card, because women tend to use them more in the direct and immediate interest of the household than men do. In anticipation of card loss or theft, cardholders are requested to remember their card number or to write it down on a piece of paper so that they may be identifi ed in card-holder ledgers. They must also be asked to report card loss or theft if possible before the distribution date, or at least before the distribution begins. The distribution then also provides the opportunity to verify whether the missing card has indeed been lost or stolen, or whether the report is an attempt at abuse or misuse. What is considered as attempted abuse and its sanctions must be clearly defi ned prior to the distribution itself, in consultation with the local authorities."
