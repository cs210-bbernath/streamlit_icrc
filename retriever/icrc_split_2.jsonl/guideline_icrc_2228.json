"taken -either by the agencies themselves or by other operators. \n# TERMINATION CRITERIA\nIt may seem paradoxical to set criteria for the termination of a programme before it has even begun. This aspect nevertheless pertains to good planning, because it encourages decision-makers to consider the programme in its overall context. The termination of a therapeutic feeding programme, and the closure of a TFC, is called for when the number of patients no longer justifi es its maintenance. This is the major practical criterion, provided that the reduction in admissions does indeed refl ect an improvement in the situation. This is not always obvious."
