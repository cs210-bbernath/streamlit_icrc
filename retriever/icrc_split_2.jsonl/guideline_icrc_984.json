"the victims' ability to provide for their own vital needs. A lack of financial resources or the loss of media coverage cannot be used as pretexts to stop a humanitarian intervention. Another ethical problem arises when organizations embark on programs without having the resources necessary to keep them operational for an adequate period. The necessity of cutting off aid is all the more dramatic if vital needs are involved. When the policies of the authorities involved are contrary to the victims' interests, humanitarian agencies may legitimately wonder whether they should conclude their operation before the appointed time. Before deciding, they must consider both the impact withdrawal will have on the authorities' attitude and the consequences for the health of the victims."
