"# CONCLUSIONS\nThe understanding and cooperation of National Societies is being sought in order to regularize the use of artifi cial milks in relief actions. Since such products are potentially hazardous if improperly used, National Societies are being asked to give careful consideration before requesting, donating or accepting consignments. Where a National Society sees a real need for artifi cial milk and appeals for such through the International Red Cross, they must be prepared to take responsibility for its safe distribution and usage. In the event of armed confl ict, the present Code of Conduct will be interpreted and applied in conformity with international humanitarian law."
