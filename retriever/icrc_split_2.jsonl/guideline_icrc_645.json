"taking into account accuracy and the confidence limits established. . proportion sought: 50%\n. degree of accuracy: 10%\n. confidence level: 95% the result will be a sample size of 96. 31 This is based on the following two formulas. For means: 32 The size of a sample for an infinite population may be calculated with the formulas studied above, with due consideration to the parameters of accuracy and confidence. The value found will serve next for the calculation of the size of a sample representing a finite population. n = z 2 (x) s 2 d 2 (+) z 2 s 2 N For proportions: n = z 2 (x) pq = d 2 + z 2 pq N\n\n# Calculating the Size of a Sample to Find a Proportion by Simple Random Sampling\nEstimate of prevalence sought (when in doubt, take 50%, which will make the sample as large as possible) Cluster sampling is known to be less accurate than simple random sampling, but this disadvantage can be offset by increasing the size of the sample."
