"To be valid, the variability of the indicator must be related mainly to the variability of what the indicator is intended to refl ect; the two must also be connected directly and quantitatively. For example, purchasing power may be taken as an indicator of access to food: in this case, access to food must vary like purchasing power, indicating that the latter is the main means of access to food, independently of the circumstances. If, on the other hand, access to food is also infl uenced by gathering activities and home production for selfconsumption, then purchasing power on its own is not a good indicator of access to food. Obvious indicators warrant caution: the incidence and prevalence rates of diarrhoea, for example, are frequently interpreted instantly as refl ecting poor water and environmental hygiene -high rates may, in fact, indicate pellagra. Indicators can have direct and indirect meanings. An anthropological corpulence indicator is a direct indicator of both the nutritional situation and health status, since food intake and the presence or absence of sickness are the two main determinants of corpulence. A corpulence indicator may therefore also be an indirect indicator of factors underlying food access and the presence or absence of sickness, for example economic status, the state of health services, water and environmental hygiene, and the ability on the part of mothers to take care of their children. Because corpulence can provide an indirect indication of so many different factors, it must be used as an indicator of the dimension it is most closely associated with, and combined with direct indicators of underlying factors. This returns to the concept of triangulation to corroborate results, by resorting to different sources of information and, thus, to a host of different indicators."
