"authorities, attempt to divert assistance for their own profi t. Here again, emergency and political constraints are frequently invoked (rightly or wrongly) to avoid cooperating with such associations. Pragmatism is however called for: organizations that derive their legitimacy from general community support (and those that form spontaneously to organize relief efforts) can be invaluable operational partners. The role of such organizations in the operational context must be carefully appraised; the modalities of collaboration with those that are found to be of real added value to the victims must then be clearly defi ned. Development aid eventually hands over its programmes to local counterparts; humanitarian aid on the other hand frequently withdraws without having strengthened its operational partners."
