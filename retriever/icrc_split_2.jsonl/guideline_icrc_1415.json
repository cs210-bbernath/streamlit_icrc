"through sampling would imply a separate sample for each group. 15 Following the same logic, in measuring the nutritional status of a given group, if specifi c age groups or sex constitute a vulnerability or discrimination factor, then sampling must be performed in each age group and for each sex. To ensure that group homogeneity is observed, sampling must always be based upon the study of documents or pilot study in the fi eld that detects groups that may differ from one another with respect to the variable under scrutiny. Pilot studies can also serve to estimate the prevalence rate of a given variable, if the latter is to be measured later by sampling."
