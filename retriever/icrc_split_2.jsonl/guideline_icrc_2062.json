"After administering treatment solutions, operating staff must monitor patients until they become alert, feed them F-75 Formula regularly, and check for infection and treatment where relevant. # Hypothermia\nHypothermia is proportional to the seriousness of severe malnutrition. On the one hand, body temperature is sub-standard because the basal metabolism diminishes with malnutrition; on the other, the lower critical temperature 17 is higher, whereas the capacity for thermo-genesis of the organism diminishes with ambient temperature (among other things, malnourished children are unable to shiver). As a result, mortality peaks among famished, unsheltered groups occur at dawn and in rainy conditions. Hypothermia is prevented by feeding patients adequately and regularly, and supplying them with appropriate shelter, that is: 9 avoiding draughts; 9 ensuring an ambient temperature above 25\u00b0C; 9 supplying clothing and bedding; 9 maintaining direct contact with carers or close relatives. Hypothermia (rectal temperature lower than 35.5\u00b0C) requires patients to be kept warm:\n9 maternal contact is best: the mother lies on her back and her child is placed on her chest, in direct contact with her skin and covered with clothes (including its head) and blankets; 9 if this is not possible, the child must be wrapped in blankets and an incandescent fi lament lamp must be placed above it but at a safe distance and rectal temperature must be checked every half-hour, as hyperthermia can set in quickly. If the child is unable to maintain a normal temperature independently within two days, death is almost inevitable (Perrin, 1985)."
