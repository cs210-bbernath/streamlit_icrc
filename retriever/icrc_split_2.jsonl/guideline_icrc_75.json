"Stakeholders determine the Guidelines for assessment in emergencies Assessment techniques columns, and the issues determine the rows. Figure 13 shows an example of stakeholder analysis matrix relating to a general food distribution (GFD). The above simplified matrix does not include such stakeholders as the humanitarian agency involved in the GFD, donors, and third parties that support the war effort. Stakeholders must be analysed in this example according to their relevance to the GFD; necessary negotiation must be undertaken in order to ensure the smooth delivery of the planned food assistance, i.e., its acceptance by all stakeholders."
