"experiences in the field and those reported in the literature. \n# MHUs are a strategy to be used as a last resort to allow population groups which are cut off from health services easier access to the health system\nIn view of the intermittent nature of the services provided by an MHU, any other strategy for providing health services is to be preferred. \n# MHUs require highly trained human resources\nThe implications of triage, the limited range of services available, continuous analysis of problems, use of the intrinsic flexibility of MHUs, and the need to ensure that the operation is consistent with the ICRC's objectives outside the area of health mean that staff working in MHUs must adhere to a strict and rational public health approach."
