"Management of supplies: as with any other food with high water content, liquid or semi-liquid milks should not be transported or distributed since the high costs involved cannot be justifi ed. (See also 4.3.1). Powdered milk in air-tight sacks or sealed tins should have a shelf-life of at least one year except for dried skimmed milk fortifi ed with Vitamin A when the shelf life is six months. This requires careful supervision of supplies."
