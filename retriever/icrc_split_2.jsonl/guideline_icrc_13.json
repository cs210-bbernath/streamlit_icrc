"Ministry of Health takes complete responsibility for the country's population. A first stage in the action taken (No. 1 in the figure) is the support given by the ICRC for a service which is entirely the responsibility of the Ministry of Health; the ICRC is there only for security reasons, following negotiations with the different armed groups. In some regions, however, the ICRC seconds its staff (usually at least one local doctor) to the Ministry of Health, and of course guarantees security -as in the previous stage (No. 2 in the figure). In the late 1990s and the beginning of the following decade the ICRC was the only humanitarian organization whose presence was accepted by the armed groups, and it therefore had to act as a substitute for the Ministry of Health."
