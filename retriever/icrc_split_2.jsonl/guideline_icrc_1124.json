"today in many rural areas, in crises, and in prisons. Interestingly, pellagra is uncommon in Central America, where maize was fi rst cultivated; this may be explained by the local custom of soaking the grains in an alkaline lime solution -this increases niacin availability substantially, improves the amino-acid balance, and reduces afl atoxin rates. Unfortunately, this practice did not follow the geographic spread of maize. The developing trend of processing maize to the point of producing fi ne white fl our -thus inducing considerable B group vitamin loss, unlike traditional processing methods -increases the risk of developing pellagra, and introduces the risk of beriberi."
