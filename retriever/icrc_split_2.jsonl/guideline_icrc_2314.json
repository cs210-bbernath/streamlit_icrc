"800 ml during the fi rst 6 months of breastfeeding. Individual variations can be substantial in terms both of production and of demand (Cameron & Hofvander, 1983). As from 4 to 6 months, maternal milk no longer covers the child's requirements in terms of energy, protein, iron, and thiamine. Other foods must therefore be introduced gradually until the child is fully weaned. After the weaning process has begun, breastfeeding continues for a duration that varies according to culture and the constraints faced by the mother. The prolonged continuation of breastfeeding (i.e. for 6 to 18 months or more) in principle guarantees the quality of dietary intake during the critical phase of weaning and exposure to infectious disease, provided that the child has access to enough other foods."
