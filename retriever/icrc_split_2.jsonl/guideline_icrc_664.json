"interval between +1.96 standard errors relative to the true mean. Accordingly, there is a 95% probability that the two means obtained will lie within this interval. To try to prove or disprove this hypothesis, the t test establishes the relation between the difference between the two means observed and the standard error of the difference, 42 which is a combination of the two standard errors inherent in each average: t = Difference between the two means Standard error of the difference 40 Value of chi squared: X 2 = (O -A)2 A where O = values observed in sample and A = values expected if there were no differences between the population groups."
