"This comment underscores the close connection between the different measures required in a crisis. In a famine, for example, a GFD may be an indispensable prerequisite for a therapeutic feeding programme, but it may also call for indispensable accompanying measures such as the provision of inputs to prepare food (e.g. milling facilities, fuel, cooking utensils), access to safe drinking water, and access to other goods and services essential for survival. # BENEFICIARY SELECTION\nIn principle, benefi ciaries are selected in the course of preliminary assessment, when populations requiring assistance are identifi ed. However, all households may not need to be included in a GFD; targeting individual households is not always possible, either because cut-off points are diffi cult to set or because targeting is not acceptable or tolerated."
