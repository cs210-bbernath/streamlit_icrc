"an ecological crisis. Anthropometric measurements allow epidemiologists to follow the development of a population's nutritional status and to detect any deterioration. If these are combined with the measurement of indicators reflecting access to food resources, a food crisis can be detected before it influences the population's nutritional status and the necessary measures can then be taken. Further back in the food chain, surveillance of agricultural activities will allow relief organizers to anticipate a crisis in access to food resources. # Availability of a Test Permitting Objective Measurement of a Given Indicator\nChoosing a test is not as simple as it might appear. The following parameters must be taken into account:\nThe word ''person'' is traditionally used in epidemiological manuals. Obviously, however, a health indicator may also correspond to objects, as in the study of the bacteria in a water source. # Representativeness\nRepresentativeness is the concordance between the elements sought and those that the test actually finds."
