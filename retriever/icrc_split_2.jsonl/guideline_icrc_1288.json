"Drawbacks: does not distinguish wasting from growth retardation (stunting), because a tall, lean child may refl ect the same weight-for-age ratio as a short, stout child; it requires accuracy in setting age, which is usually diffi cult to ensure; weight is infl uenced by variables that may alter the interpretation of results; weight is not always easily measured. # Conventional cut-off points and classifi cation:\n9 > 90%: normal nutritional status 9 90 to 75%: mild malnutrition (fi rst degree) 9 < 75 to 61%: moderate malnutrition (second degree) 9 < 60%:\nsevere malnutrition (third degree). # MUAC-for-height\nAdvantages: a very good indicator of wasting; it provides a more accurate refl ection of the real nutritional reserves of the organism than weight (which explains its stronger correlation with mortality than with weight)."
