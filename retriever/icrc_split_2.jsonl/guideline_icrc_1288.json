"agencies whose programmes are not systematically subjected to quality controls. \n\n# DEFINITIONS AND GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\nAssessment consists in the methodical gathering and compilation of information, and concludes with its analysis. The counterpart of this defi nition is that assessment teams must have an objective when conducting their work, and at least a theoretical understanding of the fi eld of investigation; they will otherwise be unable to collect the appropriate data in a proper manner, or to interpret it. Assessment rests upon a process that aims to establish and understand facts. The assessment process arises from a pre-defi ned strategy, and uses tactics adapted to circumstances."
