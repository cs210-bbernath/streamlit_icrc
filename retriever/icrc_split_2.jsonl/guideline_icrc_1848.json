"Foods that are eaten raw should be washed carefully with clean water, or peeled. They may be soaked in salted or chlorinated water. Fresh foods are in principle prepared the same day in the absence of refrigerators; even refrigerated meat, fi sh, and milk can usually only be kept for two days at most. Food that is ready for consumption must be sheltered from dust, splashes, and predators. # Cooking foodstuffs\nFood should be cooked through, especially animal products that must be brought to a temperature of 70\u00b0C at least; milk, in particular, must be boiled. # Consuming foodstuffs\nPrepared and cooked food must be consumed immediately in order to avoid the proliferation of pathogens that may have resisted cooking, or have contaminated the food after cooking (for example through contact). # Keeping prepared foodstuffs\nIn principle, cooked food should not be kept after the meal, unless this can be done at a temperature above 60\u00b0C or below 5\u00b0C. Neither option is practical (especially the sudden cooling to 5\u00b0C), and both can only be done in very small quantities. In any case, infants must never be fed items that have not been prepared immediately before. # Reheating cooked food\nThe reuse of cooked food implies that it be reheated throughout at a temperature of at least 70\u00b0C. Such foods are nevertheless also unsuitable for infants."
