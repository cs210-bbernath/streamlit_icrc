"variable, or characteristic, under consideration and to its affecting factor. For example, it would be absurd to test the hypothesis that displacement affects nutritional status by measuring -within the same sample -the nutritional status of both residents and displaced persons. In this example, it is best to select one sample of displaced persons, and another of residents, for comparison. Likewise, drought in southern Sudan probably does not affect pastoralists, farmers and fi shermen in the same way. Any variable associated with the impact of drought on these three groups and investigated through sampling would imply a separate sample for each group."
