"who has a good understanding of the specific emergency context. \n# Choose an appropriate interview technique. Most interviews (both group and individual) are based on the vulnerability and capacity framework. Your aim is to understand the problems that people face and the ways in which they cope with them. Some problems are easy to identify, for example houses destroyed by floods; for others, such as the abuse of civilians during war, you may need to dig deeper. Even seemingly straightforward issues may turn out to be more complicated when examined closely. When conducting a semi-structured interview, try to make the interviewee(s) feel relaxed."
