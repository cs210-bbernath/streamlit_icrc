"people, informant Y estimates 1,500 and informant Z estimates 1,600. You know that informant X is more reliable than the other two. You might, therefore, use a figure of 700 (or 800 or 900 or another average depending on your assumptions). Estimates are fine in the framework of an assessment. But should an intervention effectively take place, more detailed calculations must be made. Explain the needs that result from each of the problems. For example: I Problem 1: The well has run dry. The people need a source that provides at least 15 litres per person per day within 500 metres of their homes."
