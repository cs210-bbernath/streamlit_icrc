"For example, informant X gives an estimate of 500 people, informant Y estimates 1,500 and informant Z estimates 1,600. You know that informant X is more reliable than the other two. You might, therefore, use a figure of 700 (or 800 or 900 or another average depending on your assumptions). Estimates are fine in the framework of an assessment."
