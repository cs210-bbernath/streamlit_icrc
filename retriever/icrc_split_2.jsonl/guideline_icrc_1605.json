"# Benefi ciaries\nIt is possible to admit all individuals who report spontaneously to soup kitchens, especially in the case of passive targeting. However, this usually entails a number of complications: complete disorder at mealtimes, upsetting logistics plans, and the risk of lapses in proportion to the magnitude of needs. It is therefore best to set criteria for admission from the outset, and these can be combined: obvious clinical malnutrition, age groups, lists of destitute families produced in some way, etc. Criteria must be applied identically to all kitchens that are included in the programme. Clearly, declared malnutrition is an appealing criterion because it is undisputable and limits admissions, but it does not avoid malnutrition. In order to make this criterion more humane, agencies can for example admit the entire family of severely malnourished individuals if the family is known to be destitute. This approach implies that the operating agency has the means to increase admissions gradually and to open new kitchens as the situation deteriorates and existing kitchens are at maximum capacity; the upper limit is about 2,000 persons per kitchen. The task is not easy, but benefi ciaries must be identifi ed in some way."
