"cases, malnutrition persists where it already exists, or it develops. Clearly, then, the sale or exchange of food rations cannot be viewed as a negative effect; what is negative is providing insuffi cient assistance, and then accusing its destitute recipients of diverting it. On the contrary, assistance must be corrected as early as possible in order for it to satisfy the overall need for aid. This may be done by supplying the lacking essential goods and services or, when this is not feasible, by increasing rations in order for them to ensure adequate feeding and provide the surplus required to acquire the goods and services necessary for survival."
