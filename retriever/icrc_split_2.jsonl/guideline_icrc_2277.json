"does not preclude general food distributions (GFD) in such environments. SFPs are thus understood in contrast to GFDs, 2 which target individuals forming overall households, and therapeutic feeding, 3 which is aimed at severely malnourished individuals. SFPs are discussed after therapeutic feeding, owing to their hybrid role between the two really effective nutritional measures in crisis: GFDs to forestall malnutrition, and therapeutic feeding to address severe forms of malnutrition. If GFDs and therapeutic feeding perform well, SFPs are not indispensable. SFPs are nevertheless common in humanitarian interventions, and are therefore discussed here although their contribution should remain peripheral. \n# POSITION IN HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION\nSFPs play a double role in humanitarian intervention: they provide both economic support and survival relief."
