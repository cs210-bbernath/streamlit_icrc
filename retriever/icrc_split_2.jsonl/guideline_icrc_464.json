"or not; -treatment of the groups most susceptible to infection. Mass treatment is justified if the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections is very high -for example, 60-70% for ascariasis. It is only realistic, however, if the population affected is limited and lives in a restricted geographical area. Otherwise, intervention will have to be targeted to specific groups, such as children admitted to a nutrition rehabilitation center. \n\n# Modes of Intervention\n\n# Managing Sequelae\nManaging sequelae may mean, for example, treating anemia caused by hookworm, or malnutrition (although intestinal parasites are not a determining factor). The institution of a control program for intestinal parasitic infections must take into account the latent nature of each measure's specific effects."
