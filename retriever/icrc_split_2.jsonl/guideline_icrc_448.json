"of meningococcal meningitis in endemic regions is estimated at 10/100,000. During epidemic years, this incidence may increase to 500/100,000 in disadvantaged urban areas (camps can be considered to fall into this category). Meningococcal meningitis is known to develop mostly in communal settings (cities, schools, etc.). The logical conclusion, then, is that displaced-person camps are favorable breeding grounds for meningococcal epidemics. The group most at risk to develop the disease is people between the ages of 1 and 25. A doubling of the usual number of cases per week 106 is considered to constitute an epidemic. 107 It is difficult to quantify in advance the number of potential cases."
