"must in any case be eliminated prior to purifi cation. Depending on the nature and turbidity of the water, the fi ltration process can cause particles in suspension to clog fi lters completely. Proper chemical purifi cation of turbid water can be diffi cult, and the process involves large amounts of disinfectant. Sedimentation can be passive, involving the storage of water in a container or the slow, spontaneous, passage of water through a settlement (or decantation) trough so that particles settle spontaneously; it can also be active, which is faster and involves the fl occulation of particles with aluminium sulphate."
