"entire population must be treated at the same time; . patient compliance is low. See WHO, Guidelines for Cholera Control. 89 Without treatment, 50% of subjects with positive sputum will die within two years. Oxfam, Guidelines for Tuberculosis Control. 90 A positive carrier may infect an average of 10 people (although not all will develop an active form of the disease). A second, more sophisticated approach is to calculate the annual risk of infection, 91 which represents the percent of newly infected subjects in the course of a year. This percentage is linked to the number of sources of infection (subjects with positive sputum) in the population concerned."
