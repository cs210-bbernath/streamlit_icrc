"The living conditions of displaced populations probably predispose them to an increased annual risk of infection, mainly because of poor nutritional status, overcrowding, and the many infectious sources (subjects positive for the disease who have had no access to health-care services for a long time). 94 Using the calculations above, relief teams can:\n-estimate the number of people who will die if no treatment program is initiated (one active case in two will die within two years); -estimate the resources needed to implement a program to treat tuberculosis. These elements provide a basis for deciding what approach to take. # Control Programs\nPrograms to control tuberculosis have long been controversial, due to the difficulty 95 and inherent risks 96 in implementing them. With the advent of 91 Proportion of the population infected with TB in the course of a year, determined by the rate of positive tuberculin skin tests in a population sample. The annual rate of infection is equal to the percentage of cases with positive reactions divided by the average age of the sample. For example, for a population sample with an average age of 30 years, the following values could be obtained:\nThe sample must consist of people who have not been vaccinated with BCG. 92 In exceptional circumstances, this rate may rise to 5%; moreover, the relation between AIDS and tuberculosis threatens to increase the rate in regions where AIDS is prevalent."
