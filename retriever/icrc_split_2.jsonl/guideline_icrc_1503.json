The choice of the reference is a controversial issue; however this is not critical so long as the choice is an informed one. Anthropometric reference is established through the greatest possible number of measurements of supposedly healthy individuals (200 per measurement). Available reference tables relate to white European and North American subjects. Well-known tables include the Boston and Harvard tables established between 1930 and 1939 based upon a small sample of reasonably well-fed white Caucasian children, the Tanner tables based upon a homogenous English population in order to set growth standards for the United Kingdom; and the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) tables based upon large samples randomly selected in different ethnic and economic groups in the USA."
