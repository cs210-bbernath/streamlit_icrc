"vaccine is judged by its ability to confer lasting immunity. After complete immunization, the seroconversion for measles, for example, is 90-95%, for polio 98-100%, for tetanus 100%, for whooping cough 70-95%, and for diphtheria 95-98%. The duration of immunity is also an important factor. Immunization against measles provides indefinite immunity, while the immunity provided by the meningitis vaccine is limited to two or three years. There is no interference between malnutrition and the post-vaccination immune response. 16 The vaccine against cholera is not very immunogenic and, moreover, the immunity it provides is of short duration. 17 Indications for an immunization program depend on a combination of both the importance of the diseases involved and the effectiveness of the available vaccines."
