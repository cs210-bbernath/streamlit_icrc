"Later on, when a routine program has been set up, the usual immunization procedures can be followed. # Contraindications\nContraindications prompting a deferral of immunization are exceptional within the defined target groups. Under no circumstances should malnutrition 26 be considered a contraindication. 27 WHO has formulated this simple rule: ''Routine vaccinations should be administered unless the child's condition makes hospitalization necessary.'' In fact, given the risk of hospital epidemics, immunization against measles is imperative for hospitalized children. BCG is contraindicated for subjects presenting clinical signs of AIDS, but such patients can be given the other vaccines. ''In general vaccination is avoided in cases of immune deficiency, but in developing countries the risk of measles and poliomyelitis is great in unvaccinated infants, whereas the risk entailed by immunization, even in the presence of a symptomatic HIV infection, appears minor.'' 28 The uncertainty of being able to administer all the required doses for complete immunization within the recommended time limits should not rule out the 23 ''Child Mortality after High-Titer Vaccines: Prospective Study in Senegal,'' The Lancet 338 (12 Oct. 1991)."
