"cases and the population is presenting fewer moderately malnourished children. \n# Providing safety nets\nAn SFP intending to provide a safety net relates to two different situations. In the fi rst, measures are taken to counter malnutrition, especially in terms of guaranteeing regular access to adequate basic food rations. The purpose is then to complement the GFD once moderate malnutrition rates have fallen, but new cases continue to appear owing to new arrivals and/or persistently harsh living conditions (incapacity to deliver adequate healthcare, poor climatic conditions, precarious habitat and general survival). In the second situation, a GFD is uncalled for, but economic living conditions can be precarious, and/or problems can arise in the fi eld of health services, water and habitat, in turn promoting the appearance of scattered malnutrition cases."
