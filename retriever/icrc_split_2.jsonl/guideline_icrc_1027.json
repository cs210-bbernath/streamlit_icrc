"In time of war, the lack of security and the political interests involved can suddenly make the search for the basic essentials vastly more complicated. War does not affect just people; the damage done to the economic sector (agriculture in particular) and the social sector (degradation and even destruction of health systems) has an immediate effect on the population. In the long term, the socio-economic destabilization directly due to war cancels out the development efforts of the past 20 years. In the area of health, the aim of humanitarian agencies is to protect and assist war victims. They may act directly in behalf of the victims, providing them with food, water, vaccinations and medico-surgical care. Such activities must, however, be accompanied by emergency rehabilitation of local services, providing support for agriculture, health services and the usual water supply system. By adopting this strategy, humanitarian agencies will generally help to establish a more direct link with the resumption of the development process, the impact of which will of course be more lasting than that of emergency humanitarian operations. The application of this strategy is nevertheless subject to a number of constraints, the most serious of which is undoubtedly poor security, both for the victims and for the teams from humanitarian organizations. These difficulties hold up or slow down relief operations and very often limit their effectiveness. When the lack of security is used as a means of exerting pressure on the civilian population, the already fragile balance between the people and their basic resources, such as food and water, is upset. When the lack of security is too widespread or the imbalance created too great, flight is the only way out. By the same token, access to health services is seriously hampered when health facilities are impossible to enter or attacks are directed against them. Security conditions are even more precarious in countries where armed conflicts have led to the disintegration of the State: the absence of responsible authorities or their loss of control over armed bands are the main factors of risk for the medical staff of humanitarian organizations. The search for innovative intervention strategies in the area of health must remain a priority for humanitarian organizations, but it must not serve as an excuse to by-pass increasingly difficult constraints."
