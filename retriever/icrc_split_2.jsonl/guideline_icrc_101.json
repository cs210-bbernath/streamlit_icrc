"Nowadays, most computers are equipped with software for producing quick and easy graphic illustrations. Maps help to visualize a space and how that space is occupied. Like graphs, maps are a common tool in humanitarian action. They usually show physical features such as overland routes, dwellings, administrative boundaries, infrastructure, waterways (hydrography) and relief. It is best to keep them as simple as possible for field use and to restrict them to those elements that are necessary. A map can be produced (either because an appropriate one does not exist or to suit specific purposes) by using a compass and a mile counter, or even just by observation."
