"This permits patients to gain weight quickly, and to promote the metabolic shift towards anabolism, that is, tissue synthesis. This change occurs through a modifi ed balance and hormone control, and is not quickly reversible towards catabolism, which should nevertheless occur when energy requirements for maintenance exceed available nutrients. This is the case for example when the intervals between meals are excessive and daily energy intakes cover neither the catch-up underway (which is a priority in the anabolic phase), nor maintenance requirements, nor those associated with physical activity and/or thermo-genesis. As a result, a regular and adequate diet must be provided in order to avoid energy requirements not being met in time through a metabolic reversal towards catabolism. This usually entails hypoglycaemia, followed by hypothermia and death, especially in infants. This aspect is all the more important in view of the fact that nutritional catch-up is calorie and energyintensive, requiring 5 kcal (21 kJ) and 0.16 g of protein per gram of recovered tissue. Rapid catch-up (in the order of 20 g/kg/day) implies that the proportion of food that it requires is equal to or greater than maintenance requirements. For example, the maintenance requirement of a child weighing 10 kg is 1,000 kcal (4,180 kJ) per day. Based on a daily catch-up rate of 20 g/kg/day, this child will gain 200 g per day, which require 1,000 kcal (4,180 kJ) in addition to maintenance needs. Adequate and regular intake is therefore essential as soon as nutritional catch-up has begun -practically speaking, children under 5 years of age need an average intake of 200 kcal (840 kJ)/kg/day, provided that physical activity is moderate, and that thermo-genesis requirements are low. 34 If physical activity is heavy, the intake should be 250 kcal (1,050 kJ)/kg/day. With respect to protein, a corresponding P/E ration of 10 to 12% should be an adequate intake. In adolescents, energy requirements for catch-up much exceed maintenance requirements, whereas protein catch-up requirements convert into a P/E ratio of at least 11.5%. Take the example of a severely malnourished 14-year old girl weighing only 30 kg at the beginning of rehabilitation. Leaving aside the correction for her reduced basal metabolism because of malnutrition, her maintenance requirements for 30 kg is roughly 1,360 kcal (5,680 kJ) and 28.5 g of protein, that is, a P/E ratio of 8.4%. In order to achieve a catch-up of 20 g/kg/day (i.e. 20 \u00d7 30 = 600 g), she requires another 3,000 kcal (12,540 kJ) and 96 g of protein. Her total daily requirement is then 4,360 kcal (18,220 kJ) and 124.5 g of protein, for a P/E ratio of 11.4%. The same calculation applies to adults, for example a severely malnourished man only weighing 42 kg. Still leaving correction factors aside, his maintenance requirements for 42 kg is approximately 1,600 kcal (6,700 kJ) and 31.5 g of protein, whereas the catch-up of 20 g/kg/day requires 4,200 kcal (17,560 kJ) and 131 g of protein. His total daily intake must then amount to 5,800 kcal (24,240 kJ) and 162.5 g of protein, for a P/E ratio of 11.2%. These two examples show the extent of nutritional catch-up requirements in adolescents and adults. In overt crisis, the individual sojourn in a TFC should be kept as short as possible in order to restrict the waiting time of potential patients to a minimum. Nutritional rehabilitation must therefore be fast, and the objective should be a catch-up of 20 g/kg/day. This goal can be unrealistic because of biological discrepancies and differences in health status, behaviour, and circumstances; an average catch-up rate of 15 g/kg/day is thus satisfactory. A lower than 10 g/kg/day average catchup rate however suggests problems regarding the entire centre, and requires urgent action. The same warning applies to individual patients whose catch-up rate is lower than 10 g/kg/day during rehabilitation. These considerations are clearly based on the assumption that the diet supplies all nutrients in adequate amounts -especially Type II nutrients, whose absence would limit weight gain. In Angola, before the days of the Type I-Type II nutrient theory and when adequate vitamin and mineral supplements were not available, catch-up was noted to be much lower than expected according to the protein-energy intake, and appetite loss tended to spread after approximately one or two weeks of nutritional rehabilitation. The foodstuffs were in this example powdered milk, sugar, oil, corn fl our, and beans, combined into high-energy milk (twice daily), porridge (twice daily), and one normal meal per day."
