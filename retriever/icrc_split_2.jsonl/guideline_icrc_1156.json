"# Predicting developments\nPredicting the evolution of a given situation is just as important as identifying the causes of the problem in order to defi ne the need for assistance and to plan operations. Indeed, planning is often determined by this, since the nature of its causes can signifi cantly infl uence the duration of the crisis. Predicting the evolution of the situation also enables the setting of a timeframe for the operation, and enables the anticipation of the evolution of the need for assistance, according to the different possible scenarios. # Defi ning the need for assistance, constraints, and opportunities\nThe need for assistance is usually simple to defi ne, as it amounts to the gap between available resources and needs, assistance being aimed at bridging this gap. In other words, a performance of the feeding process that cannot be ensured by the usual means and cannot be compensated by coping and survival mechanisms must be balanced through assistance, up to the level of what the population can do for itself without running further risks. However, the coverage of the need for assistance may face opportunities or constraints; these must be identifi ed together with the need for assistance itself, in order to allow for them during the planning phase."
