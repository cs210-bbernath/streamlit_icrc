"below 18\u00b0C) increases the energy requirements of lightly-clad individuals substantially. Consequently, the provision of shelter material, clothing and blankets improves the impact of soup kitchen programmes if the rations just cover maintenance requirements. Soup kitchens may provide comprehensive and adequate rations or offer only complementary rations. Delivering food to institutions is seldom problematic: it is best to supply them with suffi cient food rations. # Planning\nSoup kitchens must be well planned -this is made easier by the fact that they operate on a daily routine. If the programme supplies only the strict minimum for survival, and especially if clinical malnutrition is the criterion for admission, organization is even more important in order to avoid confusion and perhaps riots. Good organization involves the following points. # Standard organization\nAll kitchens involved in the programme must observe the same:\n9 benefi ciary admission criteria; 9 benefi ciary registration methods; 9 benefi ciary control methods; 9 management; 9 supply; 9 meal times; 9 operational supervision; 9 operational evaluation; 9 staff compensation procedures; 9 ration amounts and quality; 9 benefi ciary contribution procedures where applicable (such as the supply of fi rewood and water, support to assistants, the provision of edible foliage such as cassava leaves) -but under no circumstances must the benefi ciaries be expected to pay for their meals. # Continuity\nOnce the programme has begun, interruptions must be avoided at all costs, especially in the case of malnourished subjects because their metabolism cannot easily adapt to interruptions early in the resumption of feeding -such interruptions can in fact be fatal."
