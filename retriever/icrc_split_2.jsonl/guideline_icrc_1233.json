"the local authorities, organizations, specialists or public servants), or larger groups that represent the community. The procedure consists fi rst of all of introducing and briefl y explaining the purpose of the assessment. Interlocutors must understand that the assessment aims to understand a situation, that there is no danger in providing the required information or, for that matter, in withholding it. They must also understand that assessment aims at detecting and documenting possible needs for assistance, and not at satisfying requests without further ado. The interview then rests upon a limited number of key elements, and allows for the investigation of new parameters as they arise in conversation (this method is frequently called \"semi-structured interviews\"). In order to preserve this fl exibility, it is best to abstain from written questionnaires, which tend to formalize the conversation and introduce an artifi cial distance. According to circumstances, individual or group interviews may be organized ahead, or improvised on the spot, but courtesy is essential at all times. However, interviews with key informants should in principle be prepared well in advance in order to ensure their earliest availability: such interlocutors are usually very busy. Individual and household interviews clarify the victims' perception of their situation and behaviour, and facilitate the decision as to what should be done. This information is clearly biased, and such interviews must as a result be multiplied and involve enough groups that are different with respect to the crisis. There is however no rule as to the ideal number of interviews."
