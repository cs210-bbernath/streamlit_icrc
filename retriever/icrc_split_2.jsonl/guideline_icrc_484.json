"Conversely, care should not be provided for chronic cases in no immediate risk for which technical means -usually unavailable locally -would have to be mobilized. In these cases, the patient should be placated with palliative remedies (if necessary, pain killers), and an explanation of the necessity of postponing investigations until later. This category includes such ailments as degenerative joint diseases, cataracts, etc. Serious cases requiring complex tests and/or treatments pose a completely different ethical problem. What should be done, for example, for a child with a congenital heart disease, or a patient with a very advanced form of cancer? It would be ethically questionable to try to draw up lists in advance of those complaints which should be treated and those which should not. On the other hand, it would be technically questionable to concentrate a substantial portion of available medical resources on these cases to the detriment of other cases which, although also serious, are simpler to treat. The decision must be made on a caseby-case basis, taking into account the patient's chances of survival and the local technical capacities. This policy may seem to imply that simple medical problems of a non-serious nature require no attention. Yet many minor complaints have the potential to become major ones rapidly: diarrhea can lead to dehydration, for example, or fever may be linked to an attack of malaria. Consequently, the attention given these cases is not a function solely of the patient's condition at the time of consultation, but also of the potential risk of deterioration."
