"levels, the condemnation of assistance as fuelling crisis is fallacious. If, however, tasks and duties are properly complied with, the quandary is resolved.

Indeed, recipients include GFD in their survival and economic recovery strategies, and not always as anticipated. This does not necessarily indicate the development of an assistance syndrome."
