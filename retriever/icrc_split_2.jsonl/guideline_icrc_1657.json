"The monitoring of the condition of the benefi ciary is separate from that of attendance (or absenteeism). # Monitoring benefi ciary condition and progress\nThe nutritional status of benefi ciaries is measured at regular intervals, usually on the basis of rotations. Patients need not be measured daily, even during initial treatment; bi-weekly weighing is suffi cient to monitor progress. Results must be compared immediately with the previous entry in order to detect possible complications and take appropriate measures."
