"WHO recommendation of 2,100 kcal (8,780 kJ) for planning purposes. As indicated above, the author believes that this reference ration is too low because it tends to underestimate essential parameters such as weight and physical activity. That being said, a 2,400 kcal ration may indeed be exaggerated in the light of recent data on recommended energy intakes; the latter are today set on the mean, and were previously set 2 standard deviations above the mean in order to ensure an adequate supply for the entire population. 15 It is worth noting that, at the time, recommended intakes were mainly intended for development planning in poor countries, where malnutrition was the main problem; nowadays, experts refer rather to obesity in wealthy countries, which is clearly inappropriate for humanitarian action."
