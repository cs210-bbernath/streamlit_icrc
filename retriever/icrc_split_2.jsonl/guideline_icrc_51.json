"Will the beneficiaries be free to attend? (Work in the fields, seasonal constraints, market days, etc.)\nThe main intrinsic constraint affecting MHUs is the temporary nature of the care they dispense: \"The mobile teams move on, the patient remains!\" Although evaluation of the zone enables us to document the causes of mortality and morbidity and therefore to determine the activities to be conducted, the feasibility of those activities depends on security and logistical factors. The distances to be travelled, the time required, the seasons, rises in water levels, agreements and problems of laissez-passer often restrict us to a very limited time frame. # The probability exercise shown below demonstrates the inadvisability of setting up curative MHUs :\nWhat is the probability of a patient suffering from pneumonia 14 being examined by an MHU? The probability of the patient having access to an MHU in time is equal to the ratio between the number of days that the MHU is present and the number of days in the year (formula expressed in unit of time for a given community). Probability of a consultation : number of days that the MHU is in the village number of days in the year Therefore when we carry out vaccinations in a community on an annual basis, during four two-day sessions, the probability of the patient with acute pneumonia having access to treatment at the MHU is 2%. With a weekly presence in the same village, the probability is only 14%."
