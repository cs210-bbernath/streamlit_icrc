"Are we setting out to treat acute or chronic diseases? Will the beneficiaries be free to attend? (Work in the fields, seasonal constraints, market days, etc.)\nThe main intrinsic constraint affecting MHUs is the temporary nature of the care they dispense: \"The mobile teams move on, the patient remains!\" Although evaluation of the zone enables us to document the causes of mortality and morbidity and therefore to determine the activities to be conducted, the feasibility of those activities depends on security and logistical factors. The distances to be travelled, the time required, the seasons, rises in water levels, agreements and problems of laissez-passer often restrict us to a very limited time frame."
