"or a patient with a very advanced form of cancer? It would be ethically questionable to try to draw up lists in advance of those complaints which should be treated and those which should not. On the other hand, it would be technically questionable to concentrate a substantial portion of available medical resources on these cases to the detriment of other cases which, although also serious, are simpler to treat. The decision must be made on a caseby-case basis, taking into account the patient's chances of survival and the local technical capacities. This policy may seem to imply that simple medical problems of a non-serious nature require no attention."
