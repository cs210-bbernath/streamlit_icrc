"For example, should the patient be given time to sit down? This sort of question may seem trivial during an emergency situation, but relief workers should keep in mind that the warmth of the patient's reception will largely determine the quality of the relations between patients and health-care personnel. # Taking the Patient History\nAn emergency often serves as an excuse to cut short the patient's recital of complaints. Lacking a complete patient history, however, the care provider risks misdiagnosing the problem. Moreover, when the health-care personnel (expatriates, for example) are working in an unfamiliar cultural context, the quality of the patient history is apt to suffer. # The Clinical Examination\nTraditionally, the clinical examination is an essential step in the care-giving process; in an emergency situation, its importance is all the greater because its quality must compensate for both the deficiencies of the patient history and the lack of the technical means for radiological and biological tests. # The Diagnosis\nA diagnosis falls into one of three categories:\n& ''Symptomatic'' diagnosis Symptomatic diagnoses are made mostly at the peripheral level by nonprofessional personnel, on the basis of such symptoms as fever, cough, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. & ''Clinical'' diagnosis Several symptoms are combined to arrive at a clinical diagnosis. Such diagnoses may be relatively precise, such as diagnoses of pneumonia or infected scabies, or may be merely presumptive (fever + chills + headache = malaria 17 ). & Diagnosis confirmed by additional tests Additional tests may support a diagnosis. For example, a diagnosis may be confirmed by:\n-laboratory tests (to detect malaria, or to determine the degree of anemia); -x-rays (pneumonia or bone fractures); -bacteriological cultures (to determine the bacterium involved in bacterial meningitis). Analyzed in terms of the local context 18 and standard statistics on the main causes of morbidity or mortality in similar situations, the patient's symptoms in themselves are an adequate basis for proposing satisfactory therapeutic solutions. This approach, however, more empirical than scientific, poses the risk of numerous misdiagnoses (both false positives and false negatives). To limit this danger, diagnostic tests may be performed for a sample of controversial cases. The results obtained will help to define more clearly the way to proceed for all cases, obviating the need for systematic diagnostic testing for each. # How to Proceed\nOnce a diagnosis has been made (within the limits described above), the care provider has several alternatives:\n\n# Give advice but not treatment\nThis approach must be clearly explained to patients, since they all expect to be given medicine when they go to see a health practitioner. If no satisfactory explanation is provided, not only will patients lose confidence in the care facility, but they will also be less than eager to undertake general preventive measures, for the same reason. # Order additional tests\nAt the beginning of the intervention, medical criteria can be used to rank the serious cases, most of which will not require additional investigation to determine 17 These cursory diagnoses take into account the context of the illness. In a region where malaria is rife, such a combination of symptoms would logically arouse suspicions of malaria."
