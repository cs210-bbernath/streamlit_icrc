"principal ways of sinking a well: . manual digging . mechanical digging . \n# manual drilling\n. mechanical drilling 20 The choice between these methods will depend on various factors, the importance of which varies from one situation to the next:  \n\n# alternatives (other sources of water)\n. cost versus available funds\n\n# Technical Means for Extracting Water\n\n# Gravity\nUsing gravity is the best way of drawing water, since it requires very little equipment. It can be used for some natural springs and for surface water (which can be diverted to a treatment unit). \n# Ancillary Means\nIn developing countries, there are many local methods for drawing water from wells -for example, by means of a bucket attached to a rope and either thrown directly into the well or set on the end of a counterweighted pole."
