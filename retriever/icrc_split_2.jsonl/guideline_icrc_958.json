"and not those responsible for the extortion who are penalized. Intervene without comment. This may improve the material situation of the civilian population (unless material aid is diverted by the armed group), but will not improve the victims' security. Assist the populations concerned and exert pressure on the leaders of the armed group or the regional authorities. This is the most sensible approach, but presents the risk of hardening the authorities' stance vis-a`-vis the humanitarian organizations, which may ultimately be denied access to the victims. 3 These two examples show how difficult it is to find a way of satisfying the victims' immediate needs while still maintaining ethical principles."
