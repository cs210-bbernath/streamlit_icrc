"# The Political Approach to Preventing Health Problems\nThe concrete example of injuries caused by anti-personnel mines illustrates this level of intervention. In many conflicts, notably in Afghanistan and Cambodia, the danger caused by mines persists long after the hostilities end, and it is civilians who continue to suffer the consequences. ''Those who look after people injured by anti-personnel mines and who, day after day, witness the suffering caused by these pernicious weapons, those who produce artificial limbs to help maimed children as they try to cope with their disability, all ask themselves what can be done to put an end to this terrible scourge.'' 5 The role of medical personnel is above all to care for these wounded; but they also have a moral obligation to ask how such injuries can be prevented. # How Can Such Injuries Be Prevented? The prospects for preventing the manufacture and sale of anti-personnel mines appear doubtful, unless the international media put pressure on the governments involved in mine manufacture to cease production completely. However, prevention efforts can also focus on the way mines are made, although this may sound bizarre at first. Yet these weapons could, in fact, be fitted with devices causing them to self-destruct automatically a certain length of time after they are put in the ground. Finally, with respect to the use of mines, the goal is to prohibit, or -more realistically -to limit their use, by means of precise rules. These three levels are linked. Prohibition of the use of mines goes together with intervention in mine production and trade. Intervention at these levels, however, is political. Health-care personnel working in the framework of humanitarian operations are not, of course, responsible for seeking political solutions to this problem. But it is clearly incumbent on them to point out, indeed, to denounce, the consequences of mine use to the political, military, and diplomatic authorities, and to sensitize the media to the problem. # Preventing Population Migrations\nIn situations of armed conflict, respect for the rules of international humanitarian law will prevent entire populations from having to flee their homeland. These refugees from violence flee, not because they are personally persecuted, but because of the dangers of the conflict itself: indiscriminate bombing, arbitrary displacement, confiscation of essential goods, etc. # Strategy and Selection of Intervention Programs\nIn planning a program for a given situation, humanitarian agencies may be tempted to make choices not on the basis of the victims' most urgent problems, but according to their media and/or political impact. Thus, a humanitarian organization may be tempted to select ''good'' programs -that is, programs that do not involve complicated logistics, that present little risk of political involvement, and that make a big splash in the media. The most typical example is probably the choice between nutrition rehabilitation programs and food distribution programs. In situations where there is no food, it must be kept in mind that setting up a nutrition rehabilitation program unsupported by food distributions will not contribute to a general improvement in the victims' living conditions. Moreover, this strategy may relieve the international community of any sense of responsibility, through the involvement of the media."
