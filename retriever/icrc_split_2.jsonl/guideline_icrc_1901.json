"shows that septic shock is much less common than dehydration. Nevertheless, every case of severe dehydration should suggest septic shock. The disorder must hence be identifi ed, but the differentiated diagnosis poses a sensitive problem:\n9 the signs of shock overlap signifi cantly with those of dehydration; 9 the typical signs of dehydration are misleading in the severely malnourished because sunken eyes, skin inelasticity, dryness of the mouth, and the absence of tears may all be due to malnutrition (Briend, 1997); 9 the typical signs of infection (fever, infl ammation) are attenuated in the severely malnourished.  It is tempting to recommend that dehydration and septic shock be treated systematically when dehydration is suspected, in order to avoid unnecessary risk."
