"that are relevant to operations, that is, that permit decision-making. Intended accuracy has the greatest impact on sample size. Correction for small populations Population size does not in principle infl uence sample size. However, in small populations, a correction factor may be used. A small population is one in which the sample \"n\" as calculated above exceeds 10% of the total population \"N\". In such cases, the corrected sample is calculated as follows:\ncorrected n = n /  Referring to the above example: n = 246 N = the total population, say 2,000 subjects In this example, the sample size is reduced by 11%."
