"the authoritarianism of a political regime which leaves little scope for individual and community initiatives; this type of ''political culture'' may remain very strong even during disaster situations;\n. bureaucracy, often associated with authoritarianism, which tends to slow down and sometimes block the decisions that need to be made in an emergency;\n. the absence of a contingency plan for disasters; the ''disaster formula'' defined earlier shows well the importance of prevention and preparation measures. To be carried out, however, such measures must first of all be integrated in a national disaster contingency program, and, second, be motivated by a real political will to implement them. These conditions are seldom met, owing to inadequate economic means and contradictory social priorities. # Vulnerability of the Legal System\nThe law, considered as a counterforce, may induce the authorities to meet their responsibilities in preventing disasters. The application of the law in this domain, however, still leaves much to be desired. The prevention of certain types of disaster is indeed a function of official measures: evacuating populations from stricken areas, putting certain zones off limits (for example, prohibiting agriculture on the sides of a volcano). Such measures are difficult to enforce, however, if the authorities have no viable alternatives to offer these populations. # Interactions Between the Different Types of Vulnerability\nThe number of different types of vulnerability, which encompass several levels of society, offers some idea of the complexity of the interactions between them. An example is population concentrations in areas with a strong probability of a major geophysical phenomenon (earthquake, volcanic eruption) occurring. Moving these populations elsewhere is practically unthinkable, not only for purely sociocultural reasons, but also -and especially -for economic reasons; this is true primarily of populations living close to volcanoes, 35 rivers, and deltas. 36 This interaction is still more complex when disasters give rise to mass population displacements; they break up the social fabric, cut people off from their normal sources of food, expose them to a new microbiological environment, etc."
