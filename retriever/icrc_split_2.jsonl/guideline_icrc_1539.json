"Except in operations involving passive targeting, benefi ciary population census and registration are indispensable, and must be as accurate as possible. The professional, thorough and fi rm conduct of this process then promotes the respect of the population and its traditional leaders; this respect is also the only realistic security guarantee in many settings, especially in armed confl ict. In addition to facilitating the implementation of GFD, proper registration is crucial for logistics and in terms of operational credibility towards donors, the media, and political authorities (unless the latter intend to control the food commodities involved). Whatever the chosen method, registration involves the physical counting of all individuals present, based upon prior information to the population, and the presence of all individuals living in the group under consideration. Census and registration are necessary both for direct and indirect distribution, 28 and may even be more important in the case of indirect distribution. The operating humanitarian agency is accountable for its doings and for its thoroughness in reaching its intended benefi ciaries; at the same time, it has the right and the duty not to be abused. Indirect distribution practically deprives operating agencies of means of control. As a result, registration efforts provide a unique opportunity to meet all benefi ciaries at least once, and to inform them of the process, its purpose, and its modalities. Clearly, if indirect distribution is chosen because of the absence of access to the intended benefi ciaries, then census and registration cannot be conducted either. The risks that such an option entails have been discussed earlier, and it is worth reiterating that it should be avoided if at all possible."
