"share the feature when they in fact do (false negatives). The greater the specifi city, the lower the ability to detect all true positives is. Anthropometric indicators provide a good illustration: if the severe malnutrition threshold is set at -2 standard deviations of the MUAC-for-height reference value, then the resulting indicator is highly sensitive and reveals all cases of severe malnutrition, but also many cases of moderate or mild malnutrition. If on the other hand the threshold is set at -4 standard deviations, the indicator is highly specifi c and discards all subjects that are not severely malnourished; but it also discards many subjects that are in fact severely malnourished."
