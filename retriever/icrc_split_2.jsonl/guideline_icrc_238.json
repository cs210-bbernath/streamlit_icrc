"Ideally, distribution will be gravity-fed from the storage unit. # Size of the Population\nDirect distribution at the source (a well equipped with a hand pump, for example) is satisfactory if the population is relatively small. But if the number of people depending on one source of water is high, there is a risk of ''traffic jams!'' The solution is to channel the water into a reservoir, whence it will flow into a network with a variable number of outlets, depending on the size of the population. # Technological Input\nThe technical means required to construct storage units depends on several factors: - available local materials - local technical expertise - the size of the storage unit - the type of water treatment, if treatment is necessary Treatment with sand filters may require the construction of several interconnected storage reservoirs. # Treatment of the Water\nStorage and treatment are closely linked. Water treatment procedures require that the water be stored, or at least held. Moreover, storage is in itself a form of water treatment. # Storage\nStorage plays a twofold role in water treatment. First, the sedimentation that occurs during storage reduces the amount of organic material in the water, so that less chlorine is required later, during chemical treatment. Second, storage helps eliminate certain pathogens -for example the cercariae that transmit schistosomiasis, and which die in the water after 48 hours. Moreover, holding the water in transparent reservoirs exposes it to ultraviolet rays from the sun, which eliminate most pathogens."
