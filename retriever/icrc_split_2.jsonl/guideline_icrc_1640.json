"that is usually determined by logistical constraints at distribution level. \n# The lipid energy/overall energy ratio\nAccording to different recommended intakes, the contribution of lipids should represent 10 to 20% of the overall calorie supply; only de Ville de Goyet recommends 20-40% (de Ville de Goyet, 1978). Oil is included in food rations because it is a concentrated source of energy and is essential in some cooking methods; it also enhances fl avour. This concentrated source of energy contributes especially to increasing the energy density of the diet of infants, and is evidently important in nutritional rehabilitation. Moreover, it alleviates the logistical burden in terms of transport."
