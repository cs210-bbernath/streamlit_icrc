"be compared to another indicator that can serve as reference. Such an indicator may be obtained by clinical observation of specifi c signs, or the accurate measurement of lean mass and adipose tissue -this can usually not be done in the fi eld. On the basis of clinical observation, the author of this Manual has noticed repeatedly that MUAC-for-height corroborates clinical classifi cation of marasmus better than weightfor-height. This observation is confi rmed by a study led by Van Loon, which concludes that MUACfor-age followed by MUAC-for-height are more appropriate than weight-for-height in defi ning marasmus (Van Loon, 1987). The nomenclature of the categories defi ned by classifi cation (the positioning of cut-off points) is strictly conventional and results must also be analysed and commented in order to avoid sometimes serious misunderstandings."
