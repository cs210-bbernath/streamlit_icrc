"then determines the allocation of the seeds to be distributed. One or several accessible villages are then visited in order to perform a head count and thus translate percentages into numbers. Figure 10.14 below illustrates this example of proportional piling. In this example, investigators then visit village A in order to perform a head count; if the latter produces a total of 501 persons, then 1 bean corresponds to approximately 42 persons (501 persons / 12 beans = 41.75 persons per bean). Thus, the population in the remaining villages can be estimated; also, the resulting data may be used for the attribution of seeds, or of any other type of assistance that is determined by population size."
