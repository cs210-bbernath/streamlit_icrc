"As is done for production activities, what is normally eaten must be established fi rst, and how it is usually prepared. Qualitatively, this amounts to eating habits. Then the situation at the moment of assessment must be defi ned for the sake of comparison. It is usually not possible to observe absolutely everything the household eats over a given period; sampling however produces reliable results. Therefore, samples consisting of 30 to 40 households are questioned systematically in order to establish what they eat during a 24-hour period. It is worth noting that the assessment of food consumption must include direct observation and measurements (weighing the food). The scrutiny of the diet of infants and small children is especially important to understand the nutritional and health risks that they may face. This involves obtaining information as to breastfeeding practices, the number of daily meals, and the specifi city (or its absence) of infant feeding, especially during weaning. In terms of analysis, food composition tables (or the computer programmes intended for this use) permit the comparison of real food intake and nutritional needs and, thus, the defi nition of the adequacy of the food ration. The origin and price of food defi ne how heavily it weighs within the unavoidable expenses. # NUTRITIONAL ANTHROPOMETRY\nNutritional anthropometry consists in measuring the physical dimensions of the human body in order to appraise its nutritional status. It provides information as to ponderal growth (i.e."
