"Similarly, agricultural rehabilitation programs are essential to take over from food distribution programs. Reconstruction cannot be undertaken without preliminary identification of the areas of vulnerability that gave way under the shock of the initial phenomenon. The reduction of vulnerability is the link permitting the transition from emergency programs per se (aid, rehabilitation) to a development program that will undertake the changes needed to reduce vulnerability. # III. Link Between Emergency and Development: the Reduction of Vulnerability\nAn aggressive phenomenon is always on the lookout for vulnerability in order to create problems; the latter become aggressive phenomena in turn, looking for other kinds of vulnerability. This theorem serves as a link between emergencies and development; the actual junction between the two is the reduction of vulnerability. 37 An emergency situation may reveal latent areas of vulnerability, which will be the starting point for thinking about the best way to prevent crises. The factors to be considered are represented in the following chart. # Identification of Vulnerability Within the Conceptual Framework of Development\nThe conceptual framework of development comprises all the types of vulnerability described earlier:\nEcological vulnerability . # Desertification\n\n# Deforestation\n\n# Pollution\n\n# Physical vulnerability\n\n# Location of populations near dangerous areas\n\n# Cultural taboos\n\n# Inadequacy of institutions responsible for disaster relief\n\n# Political vulnerability\n\n# Centralized decision-making processes\nLack of political will to prevent or soften the impact of disasters . # Lack of a contingency plan for disasters\nAll these kinds of vulnerability are part of the conceptual framework of development, and a damaging natural or technological phenomenon will upset or even block the functioning of the system, causing it to break down at its most vulnerable points."
