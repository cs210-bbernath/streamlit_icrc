"5. In terms of follow-up and impact assessments, benefi ciary involvement is clearly just as important, and the danger of deliberate or forced information manipulation exists here too. It must therefore be possible to verify all aspects of the operation whenever necessary. Finally, ethics concerning victims consists in voicing their concerns to the relevant authorities or forces, and to international opinion. Authorities must be reminded of their responsibilities, and encouraged to abide by their duty towards the population. As discussed previously, however, representations 18 and direct assistance may contradict. If the authorities lack both the means and the intention of abiding by their responsibilities, then no assistance is delivered, and victims pay the price. Should they also be the victims of humanitarian agencies attempting to deliver moral messages at the cost of their suffering? In such circumstances, representations turn against those they intend to help, and thus undermine humanitarian ethics. Reminding authorities of their duties must not involve the use of human suffering as a means of blackmail, and representation must combine with assistance where the latter is required. # NUTRITION MANUAL\n3.3 Ethics concerning the unaffected Chapter IX -An approach population, local services and organizations, to humanitarian action 3. Humanitarian ethics and local and national authorities\n\n# ETHICS CONCERNING THE UNAFFECTED POPULATION, LOCAL SERVICES AND ORGANIZATIONS, AND LOCAL AND NATIONAL AUTHORITIES\nThe purpose of this section is to raise awareness as to the existence of these entities, to encourage respect for and recognition of them, to draw attention to the fact that they may require assistance themselves, and to invite their involvement without risking diversion. # Unaffected population\nThe unaffected population frequently accommodates displaced persons (hence the expression \"host community\"), and the resulting cost may be such as to cause a need for assistance. In such cases, the motivation to assist the host community should clearly be humanitarian ethics and also common sense."
