"operation; 32 Constraints may prevent some needs from being met.  \n\n# Activities\nIn logical frameworks, the means of verifi cation amount to the sources of information that are used. Critical external factors are uncertainties that arise during the operation; those implementing the operation have little or no control over them, and their impact on its implementation and, thus, its success can be signifi cant. They amount to the various assumptions regarding developments in the situation, possible constraints, the risks involved in implementing the operation, and its possible negative side effects. Clearly, if the defi nition of critical external factors raises doubts as to its feasibility, then objectives have been set poorly."
