"assess the parasite's resistance, and choose the prophylactic regimen accordingly. There is no standard regime applicable to every situation. & define the groups needing protection Pregnant women constitute one group at risk which requires protection. Chemoprophylaxis should also be contemplated for children under the age of five years, assuming that chemoprophylaxis does not prevent acquisition of natural immunity. Chemoprophylaxis for the entire population is not indicated. The decision to use chemoprophylaxis will depend on the level of endemicity, the access to health services, and practical feasibility (cost and time compared with those for other measures). In the case of a non-immune population arriving in an area of strong endemicity, thought must be given to the feasibility of chemoprophylaxis for the two risk groups mentioned above."
