"protein maintenance requirements are lower with respect to energy 3. GFD implementation 3.2 Setting rations than those of adults. The protein requirements of a 3-year-old child are 1.15 g for 100 kcal (4.8% P/E%); those of an adult man are 1.7g/100 kcal (6.8% P/E%). Nutritional catch-up implies higher P/E% ratios than maintenance, and the P/E% ratio must therefore be approximately 10% in order to enable a 3-year-old to catch up 20 g/kg/day; this is covered by basic foods. In the case of an adult weighing 45 kg, it is in the order of 15%, which cannot be covered by standard basic foods."
