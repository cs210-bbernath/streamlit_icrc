"Broadly speaking, this may be the clan, in which one person is recognized for his or her medical knowledge. # Level of Care 7\nThere are three different levels of care. # Primary Level\nThe primary level corresponds to the home and the health-care station where a sick person can expect initial contact with a non-professional. Oral rehydration and the treatment of fever and minor injuries are associated with this level. This type of care involves the family, community health workers, and traditional healers. # Secondary Level\nThe simple facility where a sick person comes into contact with a health-care professional constitutes the second level. Depending on the country, this may be a dispensary or a health center. Usually, curative services are limited to ambulatory care, but some health centers are equipped with a few beds. Depending on the competence of the personnel and the financial means available, the second level may offer the possibility of laboratory tests, though x-ray machines are rarely found in such facilities. In a camp, the possibility of setting up a few beds for hospitalization may be considered if the number of patients does not justify setting up a hospital, or if the hospital serving the area is too far away or inaccessible (due to night curfews, for example). It is essential to supply the facilities at this level with drugs in accordance with WHO norms. # Tertiary Level\nThe tertiary level corresponds to the hospitals, both district and provincial. They represent the final link in the chain of care offered to patients."
