"The systematic observation of the indicators selected for assessment (such as the condition of crops, the methods of waste disposal, or the water supply) is simple. However, the more permanent, informal observation that amounts to \"reading the environment\" is a different matter: it is an investigation method in its own right, which may seem self-evident but demands experience and alertness. The quality of clothing and habitat, the presence of animal excreta, the contents of waste disposal facilities, the behaviour of key groups or individuals can all provide vital clues to confi rm impressions, suggest avenues for investigation, or corroborate or invalidate information obtained otherwise. # Measurement\nMeasurement produces quantitative data, which is useful in determining the seriousness of a given situation and the need for urgent action."
