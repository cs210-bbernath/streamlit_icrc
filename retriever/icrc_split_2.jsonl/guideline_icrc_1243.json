"This method saves the effort and time required for census or accurate subject counting. Simple random sampling is illustrated in Figures 10.5 and 10.6 below. Figure 10.5 Simple random sampling -example 1 16 Of course, these are not perfect random numbers because they are generated using an algorithm, but they are near enough for all practical purposes. In the case of EXCEL computer spreadsheets, all the names, or subject identities, are pasted in one column; the next column should then contain the function =RAND() -this produces random numbers between 0 and 1, which can then be sorted. In Figure 10.5, the subjects are numbered and randomly pre-selected; in Figure 10.6 they are not identifi ed individually prior to sampling, but are selected according to a general random direction, within an area that is suffi ciently homogenous for all individuals to be representative of the overall population. # Systematic random sampling\nSystematic sampling consists in selecting subjects at regular intervals (for example, every fi fth individual), starting from the fi rst subject, which is selected randomly. This method implies a comprehensive census and numbering of the population under scrutiny; it also requires a sound understanding of the local geographic or spatial organization in order to, in this case, count all subjects and then select those (in this example, every fi fth) to be included in the sample. The underlying principle is that random selection of the fi rst subject complies with the rules of chance, whereas subsequent subject selection is simplifi ed by the introduction of an interval size. The approach may be expressed as follows: N = the overall population, say 100 n = the number of subjects in the sample, say 20 N/n = a = the interval size, in this case 5\nThe fi rst subject is selected randomly within the fi rst interval, in this case, between 1 and 5, say 3. Then, the other subjects to be included in the sample are every fi fth subject (because the interval is 5) starting at 3 (the fi rst subject): 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, \u2026, 93, 98.
