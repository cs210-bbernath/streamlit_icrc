"calculating sample size is the value of the variable sought. Since this value is unknown, it is estimated on the basis of previous data. If this cannot be done, for instance when the variable is a percentage, it is estimated at 50%. \n# Formulas for Calculating Sample Size\nA prerequisite 27 for calculating sample size is to determine:\n. the confidence level -generally 95%, which gives a value of z = 1.96. 28\nthe degree of precision sought -expressed as d, which is the product of z (x) SE. The smaller we want the standard error to be, the bigger the sample size must be."
