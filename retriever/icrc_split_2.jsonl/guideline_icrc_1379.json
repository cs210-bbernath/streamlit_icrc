"The only option is to refer to legal provisions 6 and to operate in complete transparency, closely involving recipients and relevant authorities, be they traditional, administrative, or political, according to the modalities that are accepted by all; it must also be ensured that the food reaches its intended recipients. For this, however, humanitarian agencies must be certain to keep absolute control over GFD. # NEGATIVE AND SIDE EFFECTS OF GFD\nGFD induces side effects that are a direct consequence of the crucial role of food. The commonest side effects are the use of food as a convertible commodity in an attempt to optimize the use of available resources, changes in market prices, and changes in the economic recovery behaviour of recipients, which seek to maximize the impact of the GFD in terms of recovering their economic self-suffi ciency. Side effects are negative if they are harmful. For example, a drop in market prices may be benefi cial if it improves the access to food for those who are not directly included in the GFD but nevertheless face economic stress. The effect is however negative if it triggers off speculation and armed groups support it and exercise retaliation, which in turn causes serious security problems, both for the recipients of food aid and for those delivering it. Agencies must be aware of this pitfall and anticipate it as much as possible: negative effects may be limited or avoided if all stakeholders are well informed of the operation, and comply with assistance modalities."
