"identifi cation of malnourished individuals are all serious limiting factors. In situations of chronic marginal problems, programmes are justifi ed if the incidence of severe malnutrition is suffi ciently regular for even small therapeutic feeding units (i.e. with an accommodation capacity of 10 to 20 patients) to operate continuously. Such units can be attached to paediatric wards, or remain independent if the main paediatric disorder is malnutrition. Unit staff can also contribute to other healthcare tasks when the TFC is less busy. \n# INTEGRATION INTO THE OPERATIONAL STRATEGY\nAs seen in Section 1.3 above, therapeutic feeding is necessary but not a priority if malnutrition results from a general deterioration in living conditions and acquires epidemic proportions."
