Each of our activities must be viewed from these two angles in accordance with the ICRC's mandate, which is to provide victims with both protection and assistance. 8 A strategy such as the use of MHUs must be clearly defined in relation to these two components. While we do not set up MHUs in a region for protection purposes, we must operate them in accordance with public health standards and strive to make an impact on health. This endeavour to make an impact on health, as well as being of direct benefit to the health of the population, is vital if we want to gain the trust of warring parties by demonstrating our professionalism and neutrality. Once a relationship of trust has been established, a dialogue can be initiated and this will probably create an opportunity to raise matters such as alleged breaches of international humanitarian law. The fact that protection activities show no quantifiable or visible results is not a sufficient reason for abandoning the indispensable dimension of protection in an ICRC operational approach of whatever nature."
