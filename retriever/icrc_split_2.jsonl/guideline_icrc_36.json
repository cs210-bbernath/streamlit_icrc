"is the most complex in the work of an MHU. The basic principles of triage (both medical and surgical) are as follows. 1. We are limited by the means at our disposal (time, services, human resources, etc.). So we cannot do everything for everybody. 2. Our aim, therefore, is to achieve the best possible results for the greatest number of people. These two points appear obvious, but they are real stumbling blocks in the field. 1. Health delegates find it difficult to leave aside the least serious cases. 2. The quality of care must be the highest possible taking account of local conditions, the number of patients and the time available."
