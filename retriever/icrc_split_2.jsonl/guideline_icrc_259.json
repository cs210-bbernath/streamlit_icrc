"The risk of disease is assessed on the basis of the life span of pathogenic agents in the soil. Normally, fecal matter is stored for a year before being used as fertilizer. # & Construction standards\nThe approach should be ''tridimensional'':\n-Depth -The main risk is that the waste from the latrines will contaminate the ground water. The bottom of the pit should be two meters above the water table. 44 -Distance -Two factors are essential. First, the latrines must be far away from water sources, especially wells, to prevent contamination. 45 Second, they must be quickly accessible -though the problem of odor should be taken into account as well. Both these factors can be accommodated by building the latrines fairly close to the users' dwellings, but downwind. -Conditions inside -A latrine should offer safety and comfort: its users, especially children, should feel secure; 46 and it should be sufficiently spacious and kept clean to encourage use. The type of materials used will depend on their local availability."
