"means that 150 children from this camp require TFC attention. This is feasible, because camps are rather easy to manage: individuals can be targeted easily, distances are reasonable, and access to the population is ensured. The situation is quite different in the case of a population of 10,000 nomads scattered over several thousand square kilometres, without transport facilities. In such cases, the feasibility of a therapeutic programme must be thoroughly examined even if severe malnutrition rates reach 20 or 30% in children under 6 -diffi culties of access, transport, family separation, and the identifi cation of malnourished individuals are all serious limiting factors."
