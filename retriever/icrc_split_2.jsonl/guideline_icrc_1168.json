"prevalence levels are particularly high in women of childbearing age. Losses arising from disorders such as ulcers and any other form of bleeding obviously cause iron loss. In the tropics, the commonest causes of signifi cant loss are parasite infections such as ankylostomiasis (or hookworm infection) and schistosomiasis (or bilharzia). Malaria itself does not cause major iron loss because the latter is preserved and recycled in the organism. But where malaria is endemic, iron loss, albeit moderate in comparison with the destruction of red blood cells, nevertheless manifests itself: successful malaria control programmes also reduce anaemia prevalence levels signifi cantly (Davidson, 1979)."
