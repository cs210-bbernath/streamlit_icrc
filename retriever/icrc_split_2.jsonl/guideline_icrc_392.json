"environmental characteristics such as average temperature, vegetation, the presence of surface water at times other than the rainy season (irrigation water, for example). The appropriate ''parasite plus vector'' combination is a key factor leading to the transmission of malarial infection within the population. # Susceptibility of the Population\nThe susceptibility of the population depends on several factors: -the type of transmission In areas where transmission is stable throughout the year (holoendemic and hyperendemic regions), the immunity that results is also stable, and although the number of people presenting parasitemia may be high, the number of people actually sick is relatively low. In contrast, in regions of unstable or low transmission, immunity fluctuates, and there may be a large increase in the number of malaria cases during periods of high transmission. # -age\nIn regions of unstable transmission, all the members of the population are predisposed to attacks of malaria. In regions of stable transmission, certain age groups are more vulnerable than others."
