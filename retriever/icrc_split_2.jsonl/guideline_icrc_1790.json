"The criteria for discharge are therefore not based on anthropometry, but rather on the fact that patients are able to feed themselves with the food that is normally available. Severely malnourished adolescents and adults have also been treated in more primitive ways in Somalia (1992Somalia ( -1993, involving the direct transition from F-75 Formula during 2 or 3 days to soup kitchens; they adapted quickly, and without excessive abdominal disorder. However, the circumstances were extreme, and resources were limited in this case. In such conditions, soup kitchens may also be set up for very severely malnourished adolescents and adults to be given approximately 2,000 kcal of F-75 Formula daily for 3 or 4 days, then adding one normal meal, in order for them to consume only normal meals after 1 week. This very simple approach also yields good results, especially if kitchens are located close to a health centre where patients can go independently for care. # BACKGROUND TO SFPS\nSFPs have evolved within the public health programmes of developing countries to address stable situations. They were initially intended to promote the nutritional recovery of moderately and slightly malnourished children, as well as preventing a deterioration of the nutritional status in specifi c circumstances: poverty, weaning, or an unfavourable environment, conducive to infectious diseasewhose possible impact on the nutritional status has been discussed above."
