"volume representing the desired weight of that commodity per ration. Containers are then emptied and the mark reinforced in permanent ink or paint, in a fi ne but clearly visible line. During distribution, containers must be fi lled to a level surface up to the mark. The process may be simplifi ed by cutting containers off at the required level instead of just marking them -then a ruler or board can be run across their top to produce a levelled quantity. Clearly, containers must all be calibrated on the same scales, which have been tested beforehand. It is best to use the same containers for the same type of foodstuff in order to avoid confusion."
