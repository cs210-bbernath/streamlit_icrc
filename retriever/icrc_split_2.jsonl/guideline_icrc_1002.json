"The concept of ''comprehensive needs'' developed previously is appropriate here. A situation may arise where the food distributions have achieved their stated purpose (for example, to return malnutrition to its normal level) but in the meantime have generated perverse effects (such as increased tension between those who receive food aid and those who do not). Arrangements should be made to measure this type of harmful effect on the same basis as malnutrition rates. \n# Impact on All the Victims\nEvaluation will indicate whether the aid is uniformly distributed among all members of the target population. \n# Impact of One Program on Another\nWhat one program does may have negative consequences for what another is doing."
