"Initially they dispensed mainly curative treatment, but then gradually shifted towards preventive and health promotion activities. -In Mali in 1996, the ICRC had two MHUs responsible for implementing the expanded programme on immunization (EPI) in the Timbuktu and Bourem health districts. # MHUs must focus on serious pathologies which are slow to develop and on preventive and health promotion activities\nTo have a chance of encountering a sick patient, in view of the intermittent nature of the services they provide, MHUs are a useful strategy for dealing (by screening, for example) with pathologies which are serious but slow to develop, and for preventive and health promotion activities (such as prenatal consultations and vaccinations). # MHUs are not appropriate for a public health approach\nIt is not possible to carry out a wide range of curative, preventive and health promotion activities on an intermittent basis. The simultaneous provision of all these services in a health facility is known as the horizontal or integrated approach. Some examples : -In Colombia, MHUs provide support for the PHC services in health promotion and preventive activities (vaccination, cytology). The authorities acknowledge that the MHUs represent a stopgap solution in regions where health posts have been abandoned owing to the conflict and where the MHUs are now the only health service available. -In the Vanni region of Sri Lanka, MHUs initially provided curative services but gradually moved towards an educational function for community health workers. In Trincomalee, a Ministry of Health nurse joined the MHU team, giving prenatal consultations and administering vaccinations. # MHUs can be a strategy for emergency medical and health operations\nOnce the conditions to be treated have been selected and priorities set for the corresponding activities, and taking into account intrinsic (the MHUs) and extrinsic (the environment) constraints, MHUs may, for a limited period, constitute a strategy for providing treatment and other services. Inability to transfer the most seriously ill patients to a more specialized facility would discredit us and jeopardize our presence in the zone."
