"an improvement in the situation. This is not always obvious. Improvements may be temporary or result from changes in the image of or access to the programme. As a result, this criterion requires particular assessment for its validation. Malnutrition can recede either because the living conditions of the affected population have improved independently, or because the overall operation has succeeded in eradicating its causes and controlling its effects. Two criteria thus emerge as precursors to the practical criterion that the TFC has lost its purpose: an improved situation for the benefi ciaries, and the effi ciency of the overall operational strategy."
