"the iodine concentrations in plants and animals in the area. Water iodine levels that are lower than 2 \u03bcg/litre indicate an iodine-defi cient region. Populations living in high-risk areas, but who nowadays have access to iodized salt and varied foodstuffs (including, in particular, sea fi sh and seafood) from iodine-rich areas are no longer at risk. \n# The development of defi ciency and symptoms\nThe most striking clinical manifestations of iodine defi ciency is goitre, which is a hypertrophy (or abnormal enlargement) of the thyroid gland. This hypertrophy in fact refl ects an adaptation of the organ to an insuffi cient iodine intake, enabling it to drain more blood and, thus, improve the capture of circulating iodine, which is necessary for the synthesis of thyroid hormones."
