"of the causes of health problems is called analytical epidemiology. \n# Epidemiological Tools\n\n# Definition of an indicator\n\n# Criteria for selecting an indicator 1\nEpidemiology is not limited to the study of epidemics, but encompasses all health problems.  \n\n# Information on Health Problems\nThe list of information that can be assembled to follow the evolution of an emergency situation is particularly long. It is unrealistic to try to collect all the data possible, since that would require a great deal of time and a large staff, and the sheer volume of the data collected would make analysis difficult. The quest for information is best limited to certain health indicators, chosen for their relevance in describing a given situation or its evolution over time."
