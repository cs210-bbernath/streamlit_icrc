"The Alarm Signal\nThe alarm may be sounded by:\n. the population itself, which notices spontaneously an unusual number of deaths following fever (malaria), rash (measles), diarrhea (cholera), or other symptoms. . the surveillance system, which shows a significant increase in the number of cases of a particular pathology;\n. rumors of unknown origin to the effect that people are dying. The reliability of such an alarm depends on its origin. By definition, information furnished by a surveillance system is more credible than rumors. Whatever the source of the alarm, however, an investigation will have to be undertaken to confirm or disprove the initial reports. # Organizing the Investigation of an Epidemic\nInvestigating an epidemic involves several stages. # Confirming the Epidemic\nAn investigation undertaken to confirm an epidemic must adopt a two-pronged approach, both defining cases and confirming the increase in the number of cases. # Defining Cases\nDiagnosing cases is relatively simple when the patients have been admitted to a health-care facility."
