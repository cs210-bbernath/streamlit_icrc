"In biology and medical science, values lying outside this bracket are considered as abnormal or pathological. The expression of the index in standard deviations or Z-scores is as follows:\n-bserved value -median - ---------------------= weight-for-height index in standard deviations or Z-scores standard deviation\nIn the above example the standard deviation below the median is 1 kg, therefore:\n(8-11) / 1 = -3 standard deviations or -3 Z-scores\nAll the above calculations require the use of reference tables indicating the median, standard deviations, and centiles or anthropometric data processing computer programmes. # Anthropometry in children\nWeight-for-age or Gomez index Advantages: a good basic indicator that combines ponderal and statural growth and is useful in the monitoring of programme performance; sensitive to slight variations (although many variables can account for weight changes)."
