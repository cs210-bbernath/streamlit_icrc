"the real concerns of the victims can have serious consequences. Assessment is most commonly understood as that leading to the defi nition of needs for assistance and operational planning. However, this is in fact preliminary appraisal, and two other types of assessment are just as important: monitoring, which is a continuous data collection process in order to follow developments in the situation and the implementation of the operation, and evaluation, which is conducted after the completion of the operation (these three types of assessment are discussed later in this Chapter). Preliminary appraisal may suffer from the emergency syndrome; monitoring and impact assessments usually suffer from the negligence syndrome that so often affl icts humanitarian agencies whose programmes are not systematically subjected to quality controls."
