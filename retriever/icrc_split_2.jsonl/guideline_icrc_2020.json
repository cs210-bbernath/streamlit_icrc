"The hospital approach requires well-defi ned means and skills that are virtually impossible to deploy together in humanitarian action. Hospital facilities must also deal with social problems and/or endemic poverty, which humanitarian prevention programmes cannot easily address. In times of crisis, however, severe malnutrition and specifi c defi ciencies are more commonly primary than secondary, and their prevalence rates are usually serious. Therapeutic feeding within humanitarian action therefore follows a routine approach that includes all individuals suffering from the same type of defi ciencies. Malnutrition that results from a rapid deterioration in the living conditions of entire communities is quite easy to deal with, provided that strict procedures are observed. Complex cases are rare in proportion, simply because such patients are usually the fi rst to die when a general crisis develops."
