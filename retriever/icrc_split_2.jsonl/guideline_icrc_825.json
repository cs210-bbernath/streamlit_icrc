"In this system, every possible interaction can be imagined, such as:\n. the influence of the international economic system on the orientation and application of national economies;\n. the impact of friction between civil society and the political system on the economic and social systems;\nthe deterioration of the economic system caused by an ecological disaster, a deterioration which itself gives rise to social disturbances that may even affect the political system. The interaction between these systems can be called development when changes in one or another of them contribute to a better overall equilibrium."
