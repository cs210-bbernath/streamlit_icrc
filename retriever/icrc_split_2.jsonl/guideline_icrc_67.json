"by identifying the main events that have affected people's lives. The exercise can be done during a general group interview; the more diverse the group, the broader the perspective on local history. I Draw a line and pinpoint two or three important events that have occurred within living memory. Place them in chronological order on the line. I Explain that the objective is to fill in the gaps on this line with other past events. I Ask people to recall significant events of the past (both positive and negative) and when they happened in relation to the other events already identified."
