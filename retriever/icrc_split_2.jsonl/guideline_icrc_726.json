"the usual norms will not call forth immediate food aid. It warrants, however, closer surveillance of subsequent, related phenomena. \n# Levels of Intervention\nAn EWS is pointless unless the alarm it sounds gives rise to an intervention. Alerts prompted by threatened floods, volcanic eruptions, or earthquakes give rise to population evacuation. Emergency measures are all the more effective if prepared in advance. In cases of drought, decisions to intervene are more difficult. Intervention must take place before the beginning of great migratory movements, which are usually accompanied by high mortality. Migration in fact begins when the crisis is already serious, and the migration is in itself an additional source of stress for the physiologically most vulnerable groups."
