"household distribution network, water consumption will increase 5-10 times over. It is therefore essential to confirm that the water source will be able to supply the potential demand. & Urgency of the situation In emergency situations, the population must be provided with water as quickly as possible. It is therefore advisable to settle for a simple system in which each distribution point serves part of the population. It must, however, be ramified enough to avoid long waiting lines at the distribution points. & Local standards Local standards should be respected. For example, installing a home watersupply system in a refugee camp is unwise if neighboring populations have to walk three kilometers to fetch water from a well."
