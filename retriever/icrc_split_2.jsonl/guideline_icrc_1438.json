"The author prefers a planning ration that amounts to modern recommended energy intakes for moderately active populations. The application of intakes recommended by Latham for adults in developing countries (Latham, 1997) to the WHO 2 ration provided in Table 12.2 above results in a ration of 2,243 kcal (9,375 kJ) that can be rounded up to 2,250 kcal (9,400 kJ). This ration is neither restrictive nor exaggerated and, combined with a \u00b150 kcal (\u00b1210 kJ) tolerance margin, makes ethical and nutritional sense. # GFD implementation 3.2 Setting rations\nTable 12.5 below provides examples of rations that total approximately 2,250 kcal (9,400 kJ). Food shortages may occur in some cases because of the sheer number of victims, or because the logistics set-up has not yet been completed. In the fi rst case (as witnessed by the ICRC in Somalia in the early 1990s), rations may be restricted to 1,900 kcal (7,940 kJ), as defi ned by Seaman in 1988 (USAID, 1989). This ration keeps people alive, and checks mortality. In Somalia, however, rations were delivered in the form of meals, and the ICRC could ensure that all individuals received the same ration and consumed it on the spot, in order to limit redistributions and the splitting of already restricted rations. The underlying idea is that if all individuals consume 1,900 kcal (7 940 kJ), children up to 9 or 10 years of age are likely to regain an acceptable nutritional status. Adolescents are less likely to do so, and such a ration only permits the maintenance of adults weighing 50 kg. General distributions of take-away rations on the other hand lead to their reallocation within the family and the use of food rations to other ends than those intended, and thus complicate the practical application of the \"minimal ration\" concept. 9 In the second case, when temporary shortage is expected (2 to 3 months), it is best to consult the target group as to possible options based on available rations. The decision is then made jointly, whatever the level of famine."
