"At the time of assessment, the required resources are generated as follows:\n9 5% by agriculture; 9 10% by gathering; 9 25% by wage-labour; 9 10% by social obligations; 9 20% by survival reserves. Such a gap indicates that the available means can only satisfy 70% of the needs, and the shortfall is thus 30%."
