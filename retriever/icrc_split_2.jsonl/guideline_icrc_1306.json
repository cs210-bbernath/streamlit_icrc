"However, choices are still all too often dictated by imitation or habit, rather than by actual thought as to the investigated issue. Anthropometric indexes provide indicators for different conditions or risks. # Indicator of wasting\nAs mentioned earlier, anthropometric indexes provide an estimate of nutritional status, and not a proper refl ection of a dysfunction. All the more so because the extreme form of wasting (marasmus) that results from a metabolic adjustment to an insuffi cient dietary intake, is not necessarily pathological in itself, as frequently confi rmed in famine: individuals may be very thin without actually being sick. Thresholds must be placed very low for indicators to detect specifi cally -apart from severe physical weakness -dysfunctions in the organism resulting from an insuffi cient energy intake. However, the loss of nutritional reserves impairs survival capacity; it also indicates dysfunctions of the organism and/or the feeding process, which must be addressed. As a result, it is useful to refer to indicators of wasting, which ultimately causes marasmus, and death. The most appropriate indicators of wasting are MUAC, MUAC-for-height, and weight-for-height. MUAC is a better warning of mortality than weight-for-height. The use of MUAC alone is adequate to select individuals, but the measurement of the nutritional status of an overall population is best done with MUAC-for-height. Many sources consider weight-for-height to be the best indicator (or reference indicator) for wasting; however, this is not backed by scientifi c evidence. To distinguish between anthropometric indicators according to their refl ection of wasting, they must be compared to another indicator that can serve as reference. Such an indicator may be obtained by clinical observation of specifi c signs, or the accurate measurement of lean mass and adipose tissue -this can usually not be done in the fi eld. On the basis of clinical observation, the author of this Manual has noticed repeatedly that MUAC-for-height corroborates clinical classifi cation of marasmus better than weightfor-height. This observation is confi rmed by a study led by Van Loon, which concludes that MUACfor-age followed by MUAC-for-height are more appropriate than weight-for-height in defi ning marasmus (Van Loon, 1987). The nomenclature of the categories defi ned by classifi cation (the positioning of cut-off points) is strictly conventional and results must also be analysed and commented in order to avoid sometimes serious misunderstandings. For example, the 70% weight-for-height cut-off point (or -3 Z-scores) is more relevant as a criterion for admission into therapeutic feeding centres than as a threshold for the analysis of the overall nutritional status in a public health perspective, because it is both severe and specifi c. However, the current tendency is to consider only individuals that fall below this threshold when qualifying the severity of the nutritional situation in the overall population. From a public health angle, cut-off points must be selected in order to appraise the situation more sensitively, and to measure changes occurring over short periods of time in order to determine whether they are signifi cant or not. The different uses of cut-off points are due to the fact that action which targets communities differs from that which targets individuals, and to the confusion between cut-off points that qualify a situation as pathological, and the cut-off points that, for a pathological situation, determine action. For example, all children registered lower than -2 Z-scores in weight-for-height are wasted, but only those registered lower than -3 Z-scores are admitted to therapeutic feeding centres. # Indicator of mortality\nMUAC, related or not to age or height, provides the best indicator of mortality (Chen, 1980;Trowbridge, 1981;Briend, 1987). # Indicator of growth\nHeight-for-age is the best indicator by far. Weight-for-age is sometimes used, and may provide an idea of the growth of pre-school children. # Indicator of change\nThis implies the longitudinal study (i.e."
