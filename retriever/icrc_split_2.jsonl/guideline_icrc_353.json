"of children immunized no. of children in target group subjects in Tanzania 35 indicated that chemoprophylaxis with chlorproguanil was effective at a dose of 20 mg twice weekly, whereas other studies have shown it to be ineffective. 36 . Length of use of the drug -Chemoprophylaxis must be continued as long as there is a risk of developing the disease -for example, throughout an epidemic of cholera or meningitis, or as long as a risk of malaria persists. The proper use of the drug -It is often difficult to insure patient compliance with treatment regimens, and this is even more of a problem with chemoprophylaxis. 37 Certainly in the case of malaria, chemoprophylaxis has contributed considerably to extending the resistance of P. falciparum to the principal antimalarials. The distribution of drugs -When used for large populations, chemoprophylaxis demands a major logistic effort. The anticipated results must therefore be weighed against the fact that the operation will mobilize resources that might be more usefully employed in other kinds of activities. Taking all these considerations into account, the conclusion is that chemoprophylaxis should not be rejected out of hand; but the decision to use it demands a case-by-case approach that weighs the risks involved and focuses on the selection of specific groups at risk (for example, the families of meningitis patients, or children under the age of five and pregnant women in a non-immune population exposed to endemic malaria). # Therapeutic Approaches\n\n# Mass Treatment\nMass treatment differs from chemoprophylaxis in that it is intended to treat within a very short time all the people susceptible to developing a given disease, the aim being to reduce propagation of the disease quickly. In contrast, the search for and systematic treatment of individuals showing the symptoms of malaria or cavitary tuberculosis are intended more to reduce mortality among these patients than to limit transmission of the disease in question. In such cases, therefore, mass treatments are not indicated. The possibility of using mass treatment for ancylostomiasis (hookworm) has been suggested. 38 However, even in this particular case, a certain number of factors must be considered."
