"soap, and dried with an immaculate towel or else air-dried. A soiled soap or towel can easily turn into a culture medium. Soap should be rinsed and drained after each use. Hands should be washed before handling food or sitting down at the meal table, following each interruption of kitchen chores -especially in order to visit sanitary facilities or change diapers, and between chores (for example, after handling raw meat and before dealing with the vegetables). Fingernails are best kept short. Wounds should be dressed, especially in case of infection, and dressings should be changed often enough to keep their outside clean."
