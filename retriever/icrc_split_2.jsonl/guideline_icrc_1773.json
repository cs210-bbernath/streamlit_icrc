"a month if the population must carry it on foot. As a reminder, full rations for one month weigh roughly 18 kg; a family of fi ve, of which three are infants (and, thus, cannot carry their ration), must then carry away 90 kg at once, that is, 45 kg per adult -this is extreme. The frequency of distribution rounds must therefore be set by referring to common sense, and adapt to circumstances. If recipients face a fourday journey on foot to reach distribution points, they can hardly be expected to undertake such a journey more than once a month."
