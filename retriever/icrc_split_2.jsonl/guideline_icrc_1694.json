"enriched in micro-nutrients (which can limit defi ciency disorders substantially). Furthermore, if the distributed cereal is genetically-modifi ed (GM), its supply in the form of fl our prevents its being used as seed -sowing such seed could ultimately prove disastrous for the local economy. Comparing the respective advantages of grain and fl our shows that the use of grain mainly benefi ts donors and distributing humanitarian agencies to the detriment of its recipients; the distribution of fl our on the other hand benefi ts its recipients, at the cost of additional work and expenses for donors and distributing agencies. If milling costs devolve upon the ultimate recipients, losses and expenses can be substantial, and it is best in such cases to resort to fl our (if possible enriched in micronutrients, in order for recipients to obtain the intended food ration)."
