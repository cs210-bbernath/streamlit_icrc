"The substance of information sessions must be adapted to local circumstances and customs, and should include concrete examples, demonstrations, and the active involvement of benefi ciaries and carers alike; this approach limits the academic tendency of such sessions, which is probably pointless anyway in view of the audience and its circumstances. Such sessions can address carers or mothers facing diffi culties in feeding, breastfeeding, or caring for their dependants. Other interesting options include handicrafts, stock-breeding, and gardening, and the latter two provide the additional benefi t of varying the diet; they are however more diffi cult to manage. Gardening puts waste water to good use in the form of irrigation."
