"2,220 kcal (9,280 kJ) and 2,430 kcal (10,160 kJ) respectively. Transposing adult intakes recommended in WHO 1 to WHO 2 raises the average daily ration to 2,270 kcal (9,470 kJ). With respect to the intakes recommended by Latham for developing countries, the reference adult male weighs 63 kg, and his average daily energy requirements are 2,895 kcal (12,100 kJ); the reference adult female weighs 55 kg, and her average daily energy requirements are 2,210 kcal (9,240 kJ) (Latham, 1997). Applying this level of requirements to WHO 2 adults raises the average daily ration to 2,243 kcal (9,375 kJ). \n# NUTRITION MANUAL\nChapter XII -General food distribution 3."
