"Information and key messages must be delivered at the right time, to groups whose attention is at its strongest, that is, once the major dangers are under control. # THE LIMITS OF NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION\nGillespie and Mason have analysed common and chronic nutritional problems that relate mainly to structural and cultural issues (Gillespie & Mason, 1991); this approach provides a useful illustration of the foregoing, and facilitates the positioning of nutritional information within humanitarian action. The fi rst signal is inadequate food security at household level (which in this Manual corresponds to economic insecurity). The second signal is the association between malnutrition and infection, 1 and the third is the insuffi cient control of women over household resources, and their lack of the necessary means for adequate child care. These three main problems can be resolved by the following measures (Gillespie & Mason, 1991)."
