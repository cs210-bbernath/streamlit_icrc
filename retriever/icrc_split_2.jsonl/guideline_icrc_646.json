"can be offset by increasing the size of the sample. Experience has shown that doubling the sample size necessary for simple random sampling is sufficient to compensate for the statistical approximativeness inherent in cluster sampling. 33 In the case given above, the size of the sample in cluster sampling would be 96 x 2 = 192. N = Z 2 pq D 2 q = 1 -p\nThe minimum number of clusters must be 30. The size of the population from which the sample is drawn is in fact not very important, and it may not even be known. For a given sample size, it is better to choose a large number of clusters and a small number of individuals in each cluster rather than the contrary."
