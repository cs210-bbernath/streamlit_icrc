"The audience usually has much to say and demonstrate with respect to daily life. Likewise, trainers should encourage community bonds and initiatives to promote health and the key messages delivered during sessions. Sessions must be prepared carefully in order to proceed smoothly: to this end, the different stages are described, the required material is handy and ready for use, and positive deviants are identifi ed, as is their behaviour. Trainers must be skilled, courteous, enthusiastic, and patient."
