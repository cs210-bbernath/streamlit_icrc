"In a study on the 1988 earthquake in Armenia, E. Noji showed that of the total 500,000 people affected by the disaster, 130,000 were injured, 14,000 of them requiring hospitalization. Of the 1,500,000 people affected by the El Salvador earthquake in 1986, 10,000 were injured. Armenian injury figures were in a large part determined by poor construction and the pancake effect of the buildings collapsing. 45 In certain villages, 85-90% of the people pulled out alive from the rubble of their homes were dug out by the neighboring civilian population. This fact, of course, has a direct implication for relief organization -basically, that emphasis must be placed on preparing populations living in vulnerable areas of disaster to provide the initial assistance, rather than on devising plans that give priority to international relief teams."
