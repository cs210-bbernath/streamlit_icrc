"These rules are primarily those constituting the law of The Hague. This body of law restricts or prohibits the use of certain means of warfare during a conflict, and includes:      In war situations, health-care personnel are confronted with the consequences of the use of arms (surgeons, for example, see the results of anti-personnel mines), and those of the military tactics employed (public health personnel and displaced populations). Operating from the perspective of prevention, health-care personnel are naturally concerned in particular by the possibilities of limiting the means of warfare. The role of health-care personnel is, of course, to tend those wounded by mines, but also to address the issue on another level, respect for the international humanitarian law that prohibits the indiscriminate use of mines. 5 Similarly, health-care workers know the dramatic effects that population movements have on health."
