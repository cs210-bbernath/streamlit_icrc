"great, and without rational organization, services 22 are quickly overwhelmed. Certainly, a doubling of the population in the space of a few weeks in a city of average size often strains the capacity of hospital facilities intolerably. Nor is the quantitative aspect the only issue; emergency situations are often characterized by the presence of needs, particularly medical ones, which differ from conventional medical needs. One example is war wounds, which require a particular approach involving triage, special operating procedures, and so on. The quality of the care provided by the local services is difficult to evaluate. The rule, insofar as one exists, is to make sure that the procedures followed are not contrary to the interests of the victims."
