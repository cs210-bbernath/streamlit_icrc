"single case of smallpox is the beginning of an epidemic! The Alarm Signal\nThe alarm may be sounded by:\n. the population itself, which notices spontaneously an unusual number of deaths following fever (malaria), rash (measles), diarrhea (cholera), or other symptoms. . the surveillance system, which shows a significant increase in the number of cases of a particular pathology;\n. rumors of unknown origin to the effect that people are dying. The reliability of such an alarm depends on its origin. By definition, information furnished by a surveillance system is more credible than rumors. Whatever the source of the alarm, however, an investigation will have to be undertaken to confirm or disprove the initial reports."
