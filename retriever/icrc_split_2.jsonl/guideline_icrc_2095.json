"12 to 13% of the overall energy intake (WHO, 1988b). In actual fact, protein should account for at least 10% and at most 15% of the overall energy intake (WHO, 2003); this 10-15% bracket is not an objective: it provides a tolerance range. \n# The contribution of simple glucides to the overall energy intake\nSimple glucides are products that are used to sweeten foodstuffs, such as cane or beetroot sugar, as opposed to complex glucides, mainly the starch chains (long glucose molecule chains) that form most of the tubers, and cereal and legume seeds. Simple glucides should account for no more than 10% of the overall energy intake (WHO, 1988b)."
