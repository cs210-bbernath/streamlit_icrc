"defi ciency in the organism, and folic acid defi ciency. 41\nAnaemia caused by folic acid defi ciency usually results from a mediocre diet and food preparation methods that are deleterious for the vitamin (due to oxidation and dilution in cooking water). Moreover, the loss of red blood cells (due to malaria, for example) may precipitate anaemia through lack of folic acid to repair losses. Anaemia caused by iron defi ciency may be due to a defi cient diet, insuffi cient absorption, and iron loss. In these circumstances, the iron reserves in the organism (in the order of only 500 mg) can erode quickly."
