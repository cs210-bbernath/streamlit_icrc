Nutritional disorder 2.5 Specifi c defi ciency 9 degree 0: no goitre; 9 degree 1a: detectable goitre; 9 degree 1b: palpable goitre, but visible only when the neck is fully extended backwards; 9 degree 2: goitre visible when the neck is in its normal position; palpation is unnecessary; 9 degree 3: large, visible goitre. The classifi cation of goitre is an estimation, but nevertheless useful in comparing prevalence rates and the impact of goitre eradication programmes. The target population for goitre prevalence assessments are children between 6 and 12 years old; it is considered to be endemic when the prevalence rate in this group exceeds 10%."
