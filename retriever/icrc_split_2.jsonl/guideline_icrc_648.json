"An exercise can be performed by means of the 2 x 2 table option of EPIINFO's STATCALC function. The Chi-Squared (X 2 ) Test\nThe chi-squared test is used for values expressing the number of individuals from two or more populations who possess or do not possess the characteristic sought. The purpose of the test is to show whether or not any difference found between the values from samples of the different population groups is significant. The chi-squared test consists in computing the differences between the values observed and the one to be expected if there were no difference between the values. 39 To estimate these values, we must calculate the total number of subjects presenting the characteristic as a percentage of the entire population, and apply this percentage to the observed values of the number of cases. The values obtained are those that would appear if there were no differences in the number of cases in the different populations. The same procedure is carried out for the subjects who do not present the characteristic. The values obtained are those that would be obtained for the ''non-cases'' if there were no differences between the population groups. 40 Thus, the test calculates the differences between the observed values and the values that ought to have been obtained if there were no difference. It expresses the result in the form of a numerical value. The magnitude of this value depends on the degree of difference between the values mentioned above. Empirically, the greater the chi-squared value, the greater the probability that the populations are different. If, for example, the chi-squared value is 3.841, the probability of error is 5%, and the two populations are affirmed to be different. The chi-squared value reaches 6.635 for an error rate of 1%, and so on. There are tables to determine, on the basis of the chi-squared value and the degree of freedom, 41 the probability of an erroneous rejection of the null hypothesis. Normally, the null hypothesis is not rejected if the error rate is more than 5%. # The t Test\nThe t test is a method of comparing two means, measured from two samples taken from two populations. The starting point is the null hypothesis (no difference between the two populations)."
