"clusters of 14 children or 50 clusters of 8 children. Increasing the number of subjects in each cluster will not significantly increase the accuracy of the results; 36 it is preferable to increase the number of clusters. In the example given here, the second option (50 clusters of 8 children) would provide greater accuracy. 36 N. Birkin et al., op. cit., p. 99. \n# Geographical Location of Clusters\nSampling frame \n\n# List of populations\n\n# Locations\nAdd the sampling interval to the random number to obtain the level of the second cluster. Add the sampling interval again and again until the number of the total population is attained."
