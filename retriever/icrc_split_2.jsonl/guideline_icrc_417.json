"631. 72 This depends on the percentage of children who will be immunized despite already having acquired immunity (from a case of measles or previous inoculation). It should be noted that even when an immunization campaign has been properly implemented, groups of subjects susceptible to contracting the disease will still exist. As their numbers increase over the years, a major epidemic may be feared once they reach the critical threshold for transmission -that is, when a cohort of people at risk has developed. # Measures to Be Taken in Diagnosed Cases of Measles\nIn emergency situations, no immunization campaign, however well implemented, can guarantee an outcome of 100% immunity. It is therefore necessary to consolidate the control program with supplementary measures, such as deciding on the procedures to be used in dealing with diagnosed cases of measles. Certain steps are essential:\n-antibiotic treatment; -administration of vitamin A; 73 -information on immunization history. This last point merits particular attention, since it is the basis of the formula measuring vaccination effectiveness already mentioned: VE = (RIN -RII/ RIN) - 100. # Integrating Identification of Measles Cases in the Epidemiological Surveillance Program\nThe systematic collection of data on each case of measles diagnosed provides an indicator of the immunization's real effectiveness. If the rate of measles is high among immunized subjects, the effectiveness of the vaccine used must be questioned. In addition, the importance of supplementary measures should not be underestimated."
