"Every delegation must be constantly aware of the need to include a protection component in its activities, so as to take maximum advantage of the potential of a situation and thus deal as effectively as possible with problems of protection. The first beneficiaries of ICRC protection are the Ministry of Health representatives who accompany us on MHU programmes in the field. Population groups who are vaccinated are protected from a whole range of diseases."
