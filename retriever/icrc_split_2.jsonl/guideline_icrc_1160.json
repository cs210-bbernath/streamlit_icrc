"blood are too low for the organism to function adequately. Haemoglobin is a protein comprising four sub-units, each containing a haeme group to which iron is fi xed. The haeme group gives blood its typical deep red colour. Haemoglobin iron contributes to the transport of the oxygen required for the aerobic production of energy. Haemoglobin is contained in red blood cells; the life span of these cells is short (some four months), and their constantly renewed synthesis causes signifi cant dependency on factors that may inhibit their synthesis or that of haemoglobin. According to these limiting factors, anaemia may be microcytic (in which red blood cells are unusually small), macrocytic or megaloblastic (unusually large red blood cells), haemolytic (many red blood cells are destroyed), or hypochromic (red blood cells contain little haemoglobin)."
