"the well; in the second, it is in the water. Although the first solution would appear to be simpler, it is limited by the laws of physics, since if the water level is more than eight meters down, the pump can no longer operate. 23 The static level of the water table, then, will influence the choice of pump. The second criterion concerns the method of operating the pump: -manually (hand pump) -by an external energy source, such as wind, electricity, or sun. The factors to be considered in this choice are as follows:  27 the temptation is to install powerful technical means to provide maximum flow."
