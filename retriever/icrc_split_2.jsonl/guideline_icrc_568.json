"be taken by the services directly involved in treating casualties. The operating bloc must be cleared and ready to go as soon as the first casualties arrive; the staff in charge of the blood bank must make sure that blood reserves are adequate. In wartime conditions, such as those in which the ICRC works, 25% of the wounded receive transfusions; each of them receives approximately three units of blood. The intensive-care ward should transfer all patients whose condition permits to other wards. Beds should also be freed in other wards through the transfer of patients to departments that are not involved in emergencies, where their treatment can be continued."
