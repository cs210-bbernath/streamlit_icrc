"47 Bullets that fragment on impact cause more extensive lesions than bullets that remain intact. 48 A distinction is made between high-velocity bullets (800 m/s) and low-velocity bullets (150-200 m/s). The greater the velocity, the greater the amount of energy apt to be transferred into the body tissues."
