"the necessary essential goods and services cannot be provided directly. In terms of the nutritional role of a GFD, ration composition is determined by whether they only complement the food that recipients can secure independently, or cover their nutritional needs altogether. This approach leads to the defi nition of three different types of ration. 1. Full ration: this type is intended to meet nutritional needs entirely, as is the case in institutions (e.g. prisons, hospitals, orphanages, asylums, and homes for the elderly), camps for refugees or displaced persons, and most famine situations. 2. Complementary ration: this type is intended to complement the food that recipients can still secure independently, either directly or indirectly through their production activities."
