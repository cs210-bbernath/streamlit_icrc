"whose condition has suddenly taken a turn for the worse. \n# Resuscitation\n\n# Resuscitation is required for two major problems:\n& asphyxiation due to:\n-airway obstruction -pneumothorax -hemothorax & shock due to external or internal bleeding\n\n# Surgical Procedures\nAnother feature of wartime surgery is the type of lesions encountered, which necessitate a different therapeutic approach from that normally used. Wartime surgery requires a preliminary apprenticeship, for it has its own techniques.  Surgical care for the war-wounded is often restrictively equated with treatment by the surgical unit itself, or even by the operating theater alone. This highly reductionist view of the problem completely obscures the fact that the outcome of a surgical intervention depends on the functioning of a chain that begins with the first aid provided at the site of the injury, and ends with the rehabilitation measures designed to minimize a handicap."
