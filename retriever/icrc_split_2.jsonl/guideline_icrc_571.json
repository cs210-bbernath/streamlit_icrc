"Two pitfalls must be avoided here. First, no cases requiring emergency care should be delayed (triage sensitivity). 57 Second, non-urgent cases should not be evacuated, since they congest the surgical unit (triage specificity). 58 Triage must be a continuous process Initially, some of the wounded may be in stable condition, leading the triage team to postpone their evacuation to the surgical unit in favor of more urgent cases. However, the condition of some of these non-urgent cases may deteriorate, necessitating their immediate evacuation. # Practically speaking, this means that:\n& in the triage area, those casualties who have already been classified should be re-examined periodically; & in the hospital, those casualties initially set aside as not requiring immediate surgery should also be re-examined regularly. There are a number of different methods for classifying the injured; the following system is given here as an example. 59 Group T1: Lightly injured, able to manage for themselves. # Group T2:\nLightly injured, requiring assessment and treatment which can be provided on the spot or in the emergency room Organizing Surgical Triage in the Field 60\n\n# Safety\nThe spot chosen to sort the injured in the field should be reasonably safe. # Human Resources\nTriage is above all a decision-making process which demands experience on the part of those who assume this responsibility."
