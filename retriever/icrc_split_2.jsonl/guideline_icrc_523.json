"refer the most serious cases to the dispensary. # Training Content\n\n# A distinction must be made between what the CHWs should know (knowledge)\nand what they should be able to do. # What a CHW should know\nMany training programs in emergency situations amount to a compilation of abstract facts, without any special connection to actual skills. Must the CHW be familiar with intestinal physiology to be able to treat a case of diarrhea? Should the CHW be familiar with the list of microorganisms responsible for diarrheal diseases? Or perhaps all he or she needs to know is that diarrheal diseases are characterized essentially by water loss; that the risk of death is linked to dehydration, and that rehydration salts are the basis for treating diarrheal diseases. # What a CHW should be able to do\nA CHW should be able to diagnose cases of diarrheal disease, treat them, and identify those cases that must be referred to a higher level. Each of these tasks can be broken down into still simpler tasks. For example, to diagnose diarrheal diseases, the CHW must:\n-determine -by means of the patient history or an interview with the mother -when the disease began, the number of stools per day, and for how many days. -ask to see the stools."
