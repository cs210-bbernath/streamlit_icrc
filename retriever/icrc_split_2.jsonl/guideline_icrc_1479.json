"practices; spring balances and electronic scales may also be used. Beam balances are the most robust by far, but are unwieldy and diffi cult to transport; they also require a perfectly level surface. Spring balances must be zero-checked before each use, and must be transported carefully by blocking or removing their plate. The transport of electronic scales also requires care, and they need batteries. All types of scales must be checked before any weighing, ideally with two different known weights. The scale is set with one weight, and the second serves to test its accuracy. If the test fails, the spring must be changed."
