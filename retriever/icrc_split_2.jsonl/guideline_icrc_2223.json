"with disseminated malnutrition that is usually secondary, and targets individuals. In paediatric services especially, severe malnutrition usually affects subjects that are already vulnerable to sickness in normal living conditions in terms of their physiology. Medical disorders often complicate treatment, and patients require specifi c, often protracted attention -and in spite of this, mortality remains high. The hospital approach requires well-defi ned means and skills that are virtually impossible to deploy together in humanitarian action. Hospital facilities must also deal with social problems and/or endemic poverty, which humanitarian prevention programmes cannot easily address. In times of crisis, however, severe malnutrition and specifi c defi ciencies are more commonly primary than secondary, and their prevalence rates are usually serious."
