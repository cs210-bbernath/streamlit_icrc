"hours, the clinical signs subside, and patients are instantly relieved. Such results have been observed following oral intake of 30 mg of thiamine. There is no reason to administer excessive amounts of thiamine, because the organism excretes excesses rapidly and effi ciently. This Manual recommends compliance with the recommendations set forth by Davidson, bearing in mind that inferior doses would probably suffi ce (Latham, 1979), and that the results of oral administration from the onset would be equally good. What must be remembered is that safety margins subsist, even when means are limited. Davidson's recommendation applies to children up to the age of 10 or 12 years, but the intramuscular doses must be halved approximately (twice 15 mg/day during 3 days); this is for reasons of economy, not for any reason related to toxicity (as a reminder, thiamine is not toxic, even in very high doses)."
