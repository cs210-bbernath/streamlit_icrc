"This subject will be discussed in Chapter 8 (''Disasters and Development''). 52 This means all persons involved in the conflict, whether directly (soldiers) or indirectly (civilian populations). 53 Indiscriminate bombing of cities is an example of failure to respect the civilian population. # Handling the Wounded after Disasters or Wars\nThis section examines the specific problems of war surgery and managing the wounded (the techniques of war surgery are a specialized field). # First Aid\nConflict situations make speedy evacuation of wounded people difficult, owing mostly to:\n& the geographical location of the conflict; & the level of medical development of each of the parties to the conflict; & security constraints deriving from the conflict itself. If the fighting is in geographically remote areas and the parties to the conflict have only very minimal medical means, the wounded will have to be evacuated to hospitals behind the lines, often quite far from the combat zone. The increased time required for evacuation affects the condition of the wounded. For this reason, the quality of the first aid provided immediately or soon after the injury is essential to the patient's chances of survival. Certain simple measures can be taken which in some cases will save lives, or limit further deterioration of injuries."
