"more aid will be given where the need is greater. The authorities concerned may see this disparity as unjust if, for example, they have the ''misfortune'' to have fewer victims or needs in the territory they control, or if they are better organized than the enemy to supply the needs -partially or totally -of the victims who depend on them. Thus, the authorities who discharge their obligations properly may feel penalized in comparison with the enemy, whose victims, abandoned, will be taken care of by the humanitarian organizations. This is why, in order to attract humanitarian aid, authorities often inflate or even invent statistics concerning the number of victims, or else claim that the local facilities are unable to meet the needs of the population."
