"# The gap between means and needs\nThis gap is defi ned by analysing the consumption of food. # The behavioural gap\nThe behavioural gap may manifest itself in the following:\n9 the quality and quantity of food consumed at the moment of assessment, in comparison with normality; 9 the time devoted to the preparation of food; 9 the distribution and attribution of food; 9 the time devoted to caring for and feeding dependants; 9 the health status, which infl uences the consumption of food. For example, the consumption of cereals that would normally be kept as seeds is not an abnormal consumption, but an abnormal use of resources."
