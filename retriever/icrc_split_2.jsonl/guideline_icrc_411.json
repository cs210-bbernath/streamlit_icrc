"population arriving in a region that is hyperendemic for P. falciparum, the risk of a malaria epidemic is great. The health team must therefore coordinate curative measures -to reduce morbidity and mortality quickly -with preventive measures, which will not be immediately effective but which will help reduce the disease's impact on the population. \n# Reducing morbidity and mortality involves:\n-finding out what treatments the local authorities recommend on the basis of their experience; -diagnosing and treating cases; -monitoring the effectiveness of the treatments by in vivo tests. \n# Preventing malaria involves:\n-mobilizing and educating the population. Most of the following measures depend on the population's ability to institute and continue preventive measures."
