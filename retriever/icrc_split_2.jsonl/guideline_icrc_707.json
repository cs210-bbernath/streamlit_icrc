"to be undertaken to confirm or disprove the initial reports. \n# Organizing the Investigation of an Epidemic\nInvestigating an epidemic involves several stages. \n# Confirming the Epidemic\nAn investigation undertaken to confirm an epidemic must adopt a two-pronged approach, both defining cases and confirming the increase in the number of cases. \n# Defining Cases\nDiagnosing cases is relatively simple when the patients have been admitted to a health-care facility. It is easy to visit the facility and talk to the nursing staff. If the alarm has been raised at an early stage, some of the patients will probably still be in the hospital, where they can be examined."
