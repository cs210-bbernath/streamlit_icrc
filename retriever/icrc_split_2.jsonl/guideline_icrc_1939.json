"g of protein, that is, a P/E ratio of 8.4%. In order to achieve a catch-up of 20 g/kg/day (i.e. 20 \u00d7 30 = 600 g), she requires another 3,000 kcal (12,540 kJ) and 96 g of protein. Her total daily requirement is then 4,360 kcal (18,220 kJ) and 124.5 g of protein, for a P/E ratio of 11.4%. The same calculation applies to adults, for example a severely malnourished man only weighing 42 kg. Still leaving correction factors aside, his maintenance requirements for 42 kg is approximately 1,600 kcal (6,700 kJ) and 31.5 g of protein, whereas the catch-up of 20 g/kg/day requires 4,200 kcal (17,560 kJ) and 131 g of protein."
