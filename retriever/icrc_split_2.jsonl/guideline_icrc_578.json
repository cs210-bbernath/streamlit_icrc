"The concept of constant review is important: it prevents the inadvertent neglect of patients whose condition has suddenly taken a turn for the worse. # Resuscitation\n\n# Resuscitation is required for two major problems:\n& asphyxiation due to:\n-airway obstruction -pneumothorax -hemothorax & shock due to external or internal bleeding\n\n# Surgical Procedures\nAnother feature of wartime surgery is the type of lesions encountered, which necessitate a different therapeutic approach from that normally used. Wartime surgery requires a preliminary apprenticeship, for it has its own techniques. Surgical care for the war-wounded is often restrictively equated with treatment by the surgical unit itself, or even by the operating theater alone. This highly reductionist view of the problem completely obscures the fact that the outcome of a surgical intervention depends on the functioning of a chain that begins with the first aid provided at the site of the injury, and ends with the rehabilitation measures designed to minimize a handicap. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, the old saying goes -but as the cliche\u00b4rightly indicates, operations to benefit the war-wounded must be conceived on a global scale. The absence or mediocrity of first aid will be reflected in:\n\n# Chain of Care for Casualties in Conflict Situations\n. an increased number of deaths on the field of combat;\n. an increased number of wounded who are suffering from shock (uncontrolled bleeding) when brought to the hospital;\nan increased number of infected wounds (if evacuation is slow). The absence or mediocrity of an advance medical post and of means of medical transport will have the same effect. The quality of surgical intervention definitely affects the survival rate of the most serious cases, as well as the degree to which a functional handicap can be reduced after the injury heals -that is, whether or not a hand, a limb, etc., can be used or not. In developing countries, where the mechanisms of mutual social aid do not facilitate reintegration into society, a handicap may doom its owner to begging for a living."
