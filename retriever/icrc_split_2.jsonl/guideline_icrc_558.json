"wounded (the techniques of war surgery are a specialized field). \n# First Aid\nConflict situations make speedy evacuation of wounded people difficult, owing mostly to:\n& the geographical location of the conflict; & the level of medical development of each of the parties to the conflict; & security constraints deriving from the conflict itself. If the fighting is in geographically remote areas and the parties to the conflict have only very minimal medical means, the wounded will have to be evacuated to hospitals behind the lines, often quite far from the combat zone. The increased time required for evacuation affects the condition of the wounded."
