"provide do indeed get to the victims who need them. All humanitarian agencies accept the necessity of monitoring aid. This is why some of them, including the ICRC, make the assistance they provide conditional on their being allowed to supervise it themselves: ''When emergency assistance is required and the ICRC is particularly well placed to play a useful role by virtue of its specific mandate, it sets three conditions before undertaking any relief action, namely that it be allowed access to the persons requiring assistance, to observe their situation and to evaluate their needs; that it be present when the aid is brought in; and, finally, that it be allowed to exercise administrative supervision in order to prepare reports on distributions made.'' 10\nIf the authorities will not give advance consent to the monitoring of humanitarian assistance, the humanitarian agencies can either withhold assistance until they receive a guarantee that they will be able to supervise it, or provide the aid in the hope that the authorities will eventually yield."
