"Each will try to do better than the others. The competition is even fiercer if the field involved is one with public impact -that is, one that generates resources.

In a given situation, this competition between identical programs (nutritional rehabilitation, medical care) leads to genuine anarchy and a waste of resources. # Contest\nA contest is a form of competition, cultivated as a sport. Not only does each agency want to be the best, but it must also get to the scene of action first!"
