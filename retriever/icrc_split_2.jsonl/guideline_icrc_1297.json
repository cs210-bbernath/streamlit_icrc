"This Manual therefore prefers to refer to the previous classifi cation discussed above; it matches reality more closely, and its cut-off points are more relevant to humanitarian action. # Anthropometry in adolescents\nWeight-for-height expressed as a percentage of the median is the best method for adolescents, using the combined table provided in Annex 4.4, and the cut-off points suggested by Waterlow (see above, weight-for-height). BMI-for-age is used to distinguish malnourished adolescents from healthy individuals, the cut-off point being the 5th centile. This method is however of little practical relevance to humanitarian action."
