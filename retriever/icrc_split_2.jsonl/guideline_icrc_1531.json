"The investigation of alternative avenues should not provide a pretext to delay action when a given group faces deteriorating economic circumstances, or to target only those that that are already in poor shape. This attitude is one of the causes that can lead to famine, and it undermines efforts to impose early warning and prevention. Humanitarian agencies must remain pragmatic and avoid being overly infl uenced by the latest trend in received wisdom. In this respect, the idea of the victims' loss of motivation because of assistance is a fi gment of bias rather than reality. In the case of limited resources, targeting must be done in close collaboration with the community under consideration in order to fi nd the best possible compromise. It is worth reiterating here that humanitarian agencies should only engage in assistance operations if they have the means to do so. Targeting that is justifi ed by a lack of resources should therefore only be a passing problem arising from unexpected developments. The incessant and popular claim that humanitarian aid always lacks resources can seriously undermine the credibility of operating agencies; the latter must therefore not surrender to diffi culties and encourage such views. Politically-correct assistance can always rely on ample (even sometimes excessive) resources."
