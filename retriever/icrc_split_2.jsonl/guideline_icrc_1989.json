"relatives or other individuals nonetheless continue to suffer from hunger. If SFPs cannot meet the needs of all the individuals affected by hunger, it risks causing the following negative side effects. 9 Where the distribution is aimed at already malnourished individuals, it is tempting to famish the others who might thus become eligible for inclusion in the SFP; moreover: q when the distributed ration is eaten at home, it will be shared among the family members according to domestic priorities that humanitarian agencies should not judge; the danger is for the benefi ciary not to receive what he/she requires. One solution would be to distribute supplements to all the families accommodating malnourished members, without targeting the latter specifi cally; the danger, if the crisis is deteriorating, is the probability that other households will deliberately starve one or several of their members in order for them to be included; q when the ration is eaten in the SFP distribution centre, benefi ciaries frequently receive nothing more at home, and their nutritional status either does not improve or even deteriorates as a result."
