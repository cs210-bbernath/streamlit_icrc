"Vernet and Dr D. Nabarro of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have developed a diagram that combines weight and height and provides three cut-off points: subjects may thus be classifi ed in one of four nutritional categories. The method presents the advantage of removing the need for accurate height measurement, which saves time, human resources, and calculations."
