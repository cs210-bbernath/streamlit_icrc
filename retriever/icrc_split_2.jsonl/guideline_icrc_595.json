"# Collecting Data\nOnce epidemiologists have decided what information they want and where to find it, they must determine how to collect it: by going out to look for it, or by waiting for it to come to them. If the population is the source, then the data must be sought in the field. If the source is the health-care services, for example, a system can be organized to transfer information regularly to the epidemiological center. In emergency situations, the following considerations will influence the choice of a data collection method:\n. existence of a functional local system for data collection and analysis;\ntime available for collecting data;\nphysical access to sources of information;\n. degree of reliability required; 5\n. necessity of establishing continuity in data collection. 6 The volume of data to be collected for a given indicator raises the issue of sampling. To find out the level of malnutrition in a particular population, there is no need to examine all the children of a certain age group, since the results from a representative sample can be applied to all children of the age group selected. The sampling method chosen will depend on such factors as geography (whether the population is widely dispersed or concentrated in one place)."
