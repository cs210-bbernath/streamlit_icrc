"(season), and the geographical area (rural zone, urban zone, etc.). These elements provide the basis for calculating specific rates for certain population groups, such as:\n. the mortality rate for children under one year of age;\nthe mortality rate for children between the ages of one and five;\n. the incidence of measles in children under nine months of age;\n. the incidence of diarrheal diseases during the rainy season;\n. the prevalence of tuberculosis in a nomadic population. Different parameters can be combined as well -for example, the rate of child mortality in a rural environment, or the rate of malnutrition in female children under the age of five during the rainy season."
