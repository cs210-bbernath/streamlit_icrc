"and highly significant when the probability is less than 1%. \n# Statistical Tests\nRelative Risk\nThe measurement of relative risk is not, strictly speaking, a statistical test, since it involves merely simple calculations. However, since relative risk is directly linked to the value of the variable estimated from samples taken in two populations, it undergoes the same variations, based on the confidence level and the confidence limits. This is why the expression of the relative risk inherent in sample values takes the form of a confidence interval. An exercise can be performed by means of the 2 x 2 table option of EPIINFO's STATCALC function."
