"teaching them new agricultural techniques is not the first priority. \n# Constraints\nConstraints are what most often determines the form that intervention will take. If food production is normal but, for political reasons, food is not accessible to certain population groups, and negotiations to restore access meet with a flat refusal, relief organizations may be ''forced'' to assist these groups. \n# Interaction Between Factors\nMedia interest in a situation may facilitate the implementation of measures intended to prevent problems before it becomes necessary to solve them. Urgency and drama are often synonymous with financial support. Local authorities sometimes use access to food resources as a weapon to achieve political purposes such as encouraging populations to leave or cutting the enemy off from its sources of food."
