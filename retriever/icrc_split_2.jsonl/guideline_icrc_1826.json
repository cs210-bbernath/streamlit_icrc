"Protracted SFPs targeting entire vulnerable groups require the quarterly repetition of vitamin A administration, except for women of childbearing age as discussed earlier. # Parasite treatment\nInfestation by intestinal worms such as roundworm, hookworm and pinworm is so frequent that the general rule in an SFP centre is to treat all patients above the age of 1 systematically, upon admission, with mebendazole. Posology is a 500 mg single dose. # Iron and folic acid\nGiven that the SFP ration must be fortifi ed according to recommendations in Annex 16, medicinal iron and folic acid should not be distributed in SFP centres. # Individual care\nIndividual care mainly addresses infections calling for antibiotic treatment, and the attention required in case of diarrhoea and dehydration, for which skilled nursing staff is necessary."
