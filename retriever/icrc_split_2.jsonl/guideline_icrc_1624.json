"In all these respects, modern structures are the best option. Warehouse access must be restricted to the personnel that run it, and be limited to their working hours. The keys to the warehouse must be kept personally by the supervisor in charge, and the supervisor should always be present when anybody is in the warehouse (this task may be delegated if necessary on the supervisor's personal responsibility). 9 The best way of keeping pests at bay is to clear any spillage immediately and introduce cats to hunt rodents. Warehouses must be fumigated regularly in order to control infestation; this operation requires the involvement of skilled staff. 9 The total warehouse surface must exceed the occupied space by at least 25%, in order to afford enough space between the walls and the stocks, and in the aisles between food rows. 9 One tonne of food in 50 kg bags stacked in pairs in crossed layers makes a volume of roughly 2 cubic metres. Bags must not be stacked directly on the fl oor, but rather on pallets raised to at least 10 cm off the fl oor."
