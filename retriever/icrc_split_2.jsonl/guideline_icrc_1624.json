"loss, and this would have to be taken into account. Another logistical challenge is commodity storage and turnover; this implies that warehouse capacity permits the storage of reserves in anticipation of \"pipeline\" disorders. The rate of supply must also match the rate of distribution, allow for the most appropriate reserves, and follow the \"fi rst in/fi rst out\" principle. The greater the reserves, the more variable the commodity fl ow can be, and the lower the risk of shortages is; however in that case, storage conditions also require more attention, in order to prevent the deterioration of the commodities. On the other hand, the smaller the reserves, the more constrained the commodity fl ow is because of the greater risk of shortage; however, spoilage related to storage is of course less likely."
