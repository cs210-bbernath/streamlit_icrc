"An epidemic lasts 10 weeks on average, peaking at 4 weeks. 105 ''The human immunodeficiency virus is a nightmare-come-true for TB control workers and patients. Even though a third of the world's population is infected with TB, most people never become sick because their immune system keeps the TB germ in check. HIV destroys those cells that keep the TB germ in check. While TB/HIV co-infection currently produces just a small percentage of all TB deaths, it is one of the most rapidly growing factors in the TB epidemic. In 1990, TB/HIV co-infection was present in four percent of all TB cases. By the year 2000, coinfection will dramatically increase to nearly one in seven of all TB cases.''
