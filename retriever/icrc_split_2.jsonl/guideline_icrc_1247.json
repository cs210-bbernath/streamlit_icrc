"If the total number of tents is 4,000, and the total camp population is 20,000, then the number of children corresponding to the criteria is approximately 3,000 (N), i.e. 0.75 children per tent. If the sample size is 350 (n), then 466.7 tents (350 / 0.75) must be visited (rounded up to 467). The interval size is 4,000 / 467 = 8.57 tents, rounded down to 8. The fi rst tent is selected randomly between 1 and 8, and sampling continues by selecting every eighth tent thereafter. If the proportion of children between 6 and 59 months accommodated in each tent is unclear, it is best to conduct a pilot study into thirty or so tents in order to document this important aspect of the survey in terms of the interval size. Systematic sampling is illustrated in Figure 10.7 in which the interval size is 5, and the randomly selected fi rst tent is number 3. # Cluster random sampling\n\n# Simple method\nCluster sampling makes things easier when the overall population is large, for example in the case of an entire region. The method involves dividing a geographical area that is homogenous with respect to the variable under consideration into comparable clusters (usually along administrative or geographical lines), sampling some of these clusters randomly, and measuring subjects within the sampled clusters. All the clusters are represented graphically on a map and numbered; then, the number of clusters -referred to as \"k\" -to be assessed are chosen randomly. In order to choose the subjects, the sample size \"n\" is divided by \"k\" (the number of clusters to be assessed), which gives the number of subject to select in each chosen cluster. Subjects may then be randomly selected within these clusters, or selected systematically according to the interval approach; alternatively, all the subjects that lie within a given direction are selected (this is the systematic approach to cluster sampling, see below). # Systematic method\nA more sophisticated approach, similar to systematic sampling, consists in dividing up a given geographical area into sections, which are not strictly clusters, and obtaining for each section an acceptable estimation of the total number of subjects. The resulting data is then refl ected in a fi vecolumn table as follows:\n9 column 1 indicates the section names or numbers; 9 column 2 indicates the estimated overall population within the section; 9 column 3 indicates the aggregate population (i.e."
