"has the right and the duty not to be abused. Indirect distribution practically deprives operating agencies of means of control. As a result, registration efforts provide a unique opportunity to meet all benefi ciaries at least once, and to inform them of the process, its purpose, and its modalities. Clearly, if indirect distribution is chosen because of the absence of access to the intended benefi ciaries, then census and registration cannot be conducted either. The risks that such an option entails have been discussed earlier, and it is worth reiterating that it should be avoided if at all possible. Census and registration are based on demographic data and maps or sketches produced by preliminary assessments."
