"The impact may be on the population (number of displaced people, number of wounded, number of dead) or on the environment (extent of the destruction). 26 A disaster's impact is variable; an earthquake may do no more than ''shake the walls,'' or it may claim thousands of victims and cause mass i v e d e s t r u c t i o n t o t h e environment. # Defining a Disaster\nThe three concepts described above form the basis for a practical definition of a disaster situation, on which possible interventions at various levels can be grafted logically. According to G. Wilches-Chaux, a disaster is defined by this formula:\n\n# RISK x VULNERABILITY = DISASTER\nThis definition, however, should be modified as follows: the word risk should be replaced by the word phenomenon, for the reasons given above, and the word disaster by the expression impact of the phenomenon; the consequences of the phenomenon's impact may indeed be a disaster, but they may also consist merely in minor structural dysfunction, or else a temporary societal disorganization. As an orientation guide to the complex tangle of factors leading to a disaster, the following ''definition'' may be helpful:\nAn aggressive phenomenon is always on the lookout for vulnerability in order to create problems -either minor ones or major ones that create true disasters. This section will deal exclusively with disasters caused by natural and technological phenomena. Situations of armed conflict will be studied in Chapter 9 (''Protecting the Victims of Armed Conflicts''). Over the last thirty years, the number of victims claimed by natural phenomena and technological accidents has been growing steadily. There does not seem to have been a significant increase in the number and magnitude of natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes; the number of vulnerable people, however, has increased considerably."
