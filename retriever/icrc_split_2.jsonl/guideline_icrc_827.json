"problem in geographical areas that are unfavorable to economic development. In the agricultural domain, for example, this may mean areas with traditionally poor soil, or soil that has become so as a result of deforestation and erosion. In addition, economic difficulties have driven rural populations into the cities, where they are concentrated in unsafe areas (for example, the flooded regions in El Salvador in 1989). Development itself is a source of vulnerability. Agricultural policies that advocate single-crop farming leave farmers with nothing to fall back on in case of accidents, be they climatic, agronomic (crop diseases), or economic (price collapse)."
