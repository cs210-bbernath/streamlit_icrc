"The purpose is to avoid hypoglycaemia/hypothermia resulting from excessive intervals between meals, and an overload of the digestive system. The usual recommendation for initial treatment in a TFC involves 24-hour NUTRITION MANUAL Chapter XIII -Therapeutic feeding 4. Treating severe malnutrition 4.1 Initial treatment feeding, based on 8 meals consumed every 3 hours. In circumstances that do not permit this, meals should be spread out evenly over working hours; in principle, the minimum working time should be 12 hours per day in a TFC, and no less than 5 meals should be given during this period. 27\n\n# Food utilization\nIn order to avoid unnecessary repetitions, the utilization of food is discussed in Section 4.2.3 below, in the section on nutritional rehabilitation; fi eld workers must be familiar with its contents. # The transition to rehabilitation\nInitial treatment is completed when the patient's digestion is restored and medical complications have been treated and are receding accordingly -this is demonstrated by renewed appetite. The process takes 2 to 3 days at least, and 1 week at most after admission. Before engaging in rehabilitation, patients should be fed amounts of F-100 Formula equivalent to the amount of F-75 Formula they have been fed up until then; this makes the transition towards intensive nutritional rehabilitation easier. # Lactose intolerance\nDiarrhoea is very common early in initial treatment, and is often ascribed to lactose intolerance. 28 There are three types of lactose intolerance: intolerance associated with digestive atrophy in the severely malnourished or patients suffering from digestive disorder, intolerance resulting from the suspension of milk consumption in weaned infants, adolescents, and adults, and intolerance related to a congenital inability to synthesise lactase (lactose digestion enzyme). The fi rst two types in fact combine with diarrhoea, and disappear quickly in all age groups during initial treatment."
