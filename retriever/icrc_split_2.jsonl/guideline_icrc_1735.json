"consideration in order to fi nd the best possible compromise. It is worth reiterating here that humanitarian agencies should only engage in assistance operations if they have the means to do so. Targeting that is justifi ed by a lack of resources should therefore only be a passing problem arising from unexpected developments. The incessant and popular claim that humanitarian aid always lacks resources can seriously undermine the credibility of operating agencies; the latter must therefore not surrender to diffi culties and encourage such views. Politically-correct assistance can always rely on ample (even sometimes excessive) resources. Donors must therefore be persuaded of the minimum level of assistance required in the given circumstances."
