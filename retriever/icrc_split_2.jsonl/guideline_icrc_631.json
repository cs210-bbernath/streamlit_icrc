"after which all the subjects in these clusters are examined. This is the method that has been adopted for evaluating EPI coverage. In this application, it was calculated that 30 clusters were necessary, and that, in each cluster, it was sufficient to examine 7 children. 22 The geographical location of the clusters is determined on the basis of the sampling interval 23 and the cumulative list of the population present in each geographical location or area. A sampling frame must be constructed for each of these methods. The sampling frame may consist in a list of all subjects (simple random sampling, systematic sampling), a list of all subjects by strata (stratified sampling), or a list of all the clusters (cluster sampling)."
