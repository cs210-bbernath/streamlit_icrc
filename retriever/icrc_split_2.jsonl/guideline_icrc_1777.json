"This phase usually lasts 2 weeks during which at least 75% of the diet must be identical to the patient's normal diet, the nutritional status must remain stable, and possible health problems must have been resolved. During the fi rst week of this preparation for discharge, meals are reduced to four per day, two of which are normal, one consists of milk, and the last of porridge; during the second week, three normal meals are combined with one meal of porridge or milk. If nutritional rehabilitation is terminated because the child is no longer severely malnourished and is transferred to an SFP centre, there is no need for the transition to a normal diet, as this process will take place within the SFP centre, where rations are consumed on the spot under supervision. After 2 weeks, patients are ready for discharge from the TFC if their weight is stable and their medical problems resolved. # FOLLOW-UP\nAfter discharge, children should preferably be monitored by measuring their nutritional status and developments in their health status. Discharged children should be visited 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after their return home."
