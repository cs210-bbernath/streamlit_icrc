"National legislation establishes the responsibilities of various organizations involved in disaster prevention and relief. In Jamaica, for example, a body known as the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) is empowered to raise funds itself for its interventions. In many countries, however, the institution of disaster prevention programs meets with numerous obstacles."
