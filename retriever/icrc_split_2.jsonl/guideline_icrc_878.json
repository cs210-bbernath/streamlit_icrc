"possibilities of prevention, the starting point for any development process. Countries in Latin America and Asia have demonstrated their ability to confront their responsibilities in both disaster response and disaster prevention; whereas others, notably in Africa, are inexorably plunging deeper into the downward spiral of poverty. Emergency practitioners must be able to integrate disaster prevention programs into the wider perspective of the major problems facing humanity at the dawn of the 21st century:\n. anarchical management of natural resources\n. economic development based exclusively on mercenary considerations\n. uncontrolled population growth\n. lack of social equality\n. mass population migrations\n."
