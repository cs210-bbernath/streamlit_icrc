"# Intervention at the Source\nInfectious agents can rarely be attacked directly in the environment; usually intervention must take the form of controlling transmission. 10 This kind of intervention may be:\n-physical: mosquito nets to prevent contact between mosquitoes and humans -hygienic: personal hygiene to reduce contact between fecal matter and humans -chemical: water chlorination, insecticides against mosquitoes, etc. # Intervention to Modify Immune Status\nThe classic type of intervention here is immunization against pathogenic agents, if an effective vaccine exists. Together with direct intervention to improve immune status, many steps may be taken to help reinforce the body's natural defenses, such as maintaining a satisfactory nutritional status. 11\n\n# Intervention at the Biological Stage\nIn an emergency, the possibilities of intervening at the biological stage are rather limited. Biological screening is of value only if it is followed by practical measures to control the disease it detects. # Intervention at the Clinical Stage\nIntervention at the clinical stage is the level of intervention most familiar to medical personnel."
