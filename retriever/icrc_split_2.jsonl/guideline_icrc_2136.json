"Finally, it is worth noting that protein complements are also important vitamin and mineral complements, especially if the staple food is high-extraction cereal fl our or polished, non-steamed rice. # Energy\nThe energy complement should account for 15 to 30% of the overall energy intake; in terms of a 2,400 kcal (10,000 kJ) ration, this converts roughly into the following:\n9 40 to 80 g of oil; 9 50 to 100 g of butter; 9 60 g of sugar with 15 to 55 g of oil; 9 65 to 130 g of dried peanuts; 9 60 to 120 g of nuts; 9 70 to 140 g of oilseeds. In dietary terms, the population of wealthy countries whose physical activity is light should observe the lower values provided above for oil, butter, and sugar, and adjust its energy intake with its staple food. # Vitamins and minerals (fruit and vegetables)\nThe minimum daily intake recommended by the WHO is 340 g. This amount however far exceeds that consumed in many settings, especially in the industrialized West."
