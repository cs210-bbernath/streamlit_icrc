"The arithmetic mean is the most commonly used measure. 17 \n\n# Distribution Curve\nIf all the individual values for a given population are represented on a graph, the result is the classic or ''normal'' distribution curve (Gaussian curve), with the arithmetic mean as its center. The individual values will be distributed around the mean, spreading out more or less in relation to the latter. # Measures of Variability\nIn a given population, each individual value will be a different distance from the mean. On the basis of this fact, the degree to which these values vary from the mean can be determined by calculations of various kinds, ranging from the simplest to the most complex. 18 The basic measures of variability are:\n. the mean deviation: the sum of the individual deviations (ignoring negative or positive signs) divided by the number of observations;\n. the variance: the sum of the squares of individual deviations divided by the number of observations; 19 . the standard deviation: the square root of the variance. 20 Calculating the standard deviation is pointless unless it will lead to practical applications. The mean and the standard deviation represented on a Gaussian curve produce the following result:\n. 68% of the individual values are situated within the limits constituted by the mean and +1 standard deviation. . 96% of the individual values are situated within the limits constituted by the mean and +2 standard deviations. If we take the example of the birth weights of a group of children where the arithmetic mean is 3 kilos and the standard deviation is 400 grams, 95% of the birth weights can be assumed to fall between 2.2 kilos and 3.8 kilos. # Implications for Emergency Situations\nThe standard deviation is the measure of variability most commonly used. The method of calculating the standard deviation should be properly understood, even though the EPIINFO computer program performs it automatically. # Measures of Comparison\nBy comparing the values for two different populations, an evaluator can perceive possible differe n c e s b e t w e e n t h e t w o ."
