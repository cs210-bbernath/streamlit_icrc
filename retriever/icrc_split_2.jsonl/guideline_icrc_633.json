"are scattered over large areas, then cluster sampling is preferable. -cost of the evaluation -In the case of widely dispersed populations, cluster sampling is less costly than other sampling methods, since it involves less moving around. -degree of accuracy -Cluster sampling is statistically less precise than the other sampling methods. -constraints inherent in emergency situations -The sampling method should take account of such constraints as lack of time, lack of qualified personnel, and lack of access to all the population groups affected by the emergency. All this means that implementing correct sampling methods is often difficult in an emergency situation."
