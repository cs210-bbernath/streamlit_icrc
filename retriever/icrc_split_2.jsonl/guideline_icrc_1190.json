"Such research is not discussed here. # The different types of assessment\n2.3 Monitoring\n\n# MONITORING\nMonitoring is a continuous, or at least a regular, process; it seeks to detect changes in the nutritional situation of a given population, and to supervise the practical implementation of the operation if relevant. In terms of nutritional monitoring, assessment rests upon pre-defi ned indicators, and takes place according to a plan that allows for events that may affect the different stages of the feeding process. It includes balance studies at regular intervals (or compliant with critical stages), in order to use the resulting data. 11 The difference between monitoring and follow-up lies in the fact that monitoring refers to the overall process, whereas follow-up refers to a specifi c activity. The follow-up of the nutritional status is part of nutritional monitoring. Programme follow-up involves the supervision of its implementation according to the initial plan. # The objectives of monitoring\n\n# General objective\nThe general objective is to lead to relevant operational decisions. This is achieved by securing continuous and regular information on the nutritional condition of a given population or individuals, on the factors that infl uence it, and on any others that may affect the conduct of the operation. # Specifi c objectives\n1. To monitor the evolution of factors (phenomena, vulnerabilities, impacts, and problems) that prompted humanitarian action in the fi rst place. 2."
