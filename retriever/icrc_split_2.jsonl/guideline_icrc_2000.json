"Logical frameworks provide a practical summary of the defi nition of objectives; Table 10.9 provides an example of a logical framework matrix. # Planning stages\n3.6 Planning evaluation 3.5 Planning implementation 3.7 Allowing for adjustment and monitoring 3.8 Planning withdrawal\n\n# PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING\nImplementation planning consists in determining:\n9 the roles and responsibilities of staff members; 9 the logistics chain; 9 the activity calendar or timeframe; 9 administrative aspects (staff accommodation, labour regulations, codes of conduct and security guidelines); 9 the operational methodology; 9 coordination with other stakeholders. Monitoring planning consists in determining: 9 situation (or context) tracking methods; 9 indicators in relation to situation tracking and operational progress; 9 operators who will be in charge of monitoring; 9 the monitoring timeframe; 9 reporting lines and methods. # PLANNING EVALUATION\nPlanning the evaluation in the operation consists in developing procedures that must include: 9 methods and indicators to appraise the impact of the operation; 9 the calendar of evaluation surveys; 9 the external contributors (individuals and/or agencies) who will lead the exercise; 9 reporting lines, methods, and deadlines. A number of circumstances may prompt withdrawal:\n9 the operational objectives have been achieved; 9 other agencies are better equipped to continue the programme; 9 changes in the situation make the operation obsolete; 9 the operational objectives can no longer be met owing to factors such as: q insecurity; q negative side effects of the operation; q unacceptable political circumstances; q accidents related to insecurity; q unforeseen resource shortages; q unacceptable humanitarian competition; q political conditions imposed upon the operation; q administrative, bureaucratic and political hassles; q logistical diffi culties. Withdrawal modalities determine:\n9 whether withdrawal is complete or partial -if the latter, what is maintained and why; 9 the timeframe for withdrawal from the moment the fi rst condition for withdrawal appears; 9 staff withdrawal modalities; 9 the utilization of remaining resources; 9 the manner and timeframe of handover to other agencies; 9 the possible follow-up after withdrawal. The stages of planning must be compiled in an action plan that provides the basis and reference for the entire duration of the operation."
