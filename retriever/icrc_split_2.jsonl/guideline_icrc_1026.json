"7. The European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO)\n\n# History\nThe European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) was created in 1992 in order to increase the effectiveness and visibility of the European Union's humanitarian efforts. In addition, the European Commission wanted to concentrate its various emergency-relief instruments within a single organization. # Mandate\nECHO reflects the desire of the European Union to provide more rapid and effective assistance to the victims of conflicts taking place in third countries. # Role\nECHO intervenes primarily by obtaining funding for the activities of its operational partners (international and non-governmental organizations, the ICRC). ECHO also implements its own operations as a subsidiary activity. # A New Organization: the Geneva Foundation\n\n# History\nThe Geneva Foundation was established in 1994 in Geneva. It was born of the perceived need to rationalize the humanitarian response, given the disproportion between the needs of war victims and the resources made available to the organizations working to help them. # Structure\nThe Geneva Foundation is composed of 12 members: the 4 founding members, 2 members nominated by the ICRC, 2 from the academic world, and 4 proposed by the Swiss cantonal and federal authorities. It is financed by private donations. # Role\nThe pooling of field experiences and the creation of a multidisciplinary framework for reflection will facilitate a better understanding of health problems in armed conflict situations and foster the development of new and original solutions. The Foundation will collect information, create documentation, and organize international seminars and meetings, as well as study units to examine health matters related to armed conflicts. Many other organizations could have been cited (SCF and OXFAM as NGOs, USAID and OFDA as governmental agencies). The purpose here is not to draw up an exhaustive list of all humanitarian agencies, but rather to illustrate their role through a few examples. In situations of armed conflict, needs are not limited to health care, but also include measures to protect the victims. The intervention of humanitarian agencies is occasionally made difficult by the complexity of the political environment, which in many cases restricts access to the victims. Respect for a humanitarian ethic is essential, despite the constraints inherent in situations of armed conflict. Under no circumstances should the difficulties encountered serve as an excuse for interventions that are thirdrate or even dangerous for the victims. Consultation, coordination, and cooperation between agencies are the basis for a code of conduct governing the relations between them. However, these forms of collaboration must respect the specific mandate and/or intervention strategies of each humanitarian organization. Mention the word ''war'', and our thoughts turn at once to those most directly affected: the dead and wounded, prisoners, those who have gone missing or been separated from their families, those who have been forced to flee. Their plight is dramatic and requires immediate humanitarian action, but it is merely the tip of the iceberg, the most visible manifestation of all the perverse effects of war, which can be analyzed from two points of view. # CONCLUSION\nFor war victims, health most often means survival, which in turn depends on access to those essentials of life which are food, water and medical care. In many cases this access is a challenge that people already have to meet every day in time of peace."
