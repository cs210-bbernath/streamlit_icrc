"The active search for individual cases on the basis of household visits is particularly recommended in such circumstances. # Providing a relay for therapeutic feeding\nWhen therapeutic feeding centres (TFC) are overstretched, it may be preferable to complete the nutritional treatment in an SFP centre, linked to the TFC. Children must be transferred as soon as they are no longer severely malnourished. Implementation modalities are those described in Section 2.1.1.A above. When SFPs provide a relay for therapeutic feeding, it is crucial that the entire population have adequate access to food (GFD or adequate individual resources), and that the other measures against malnutrition be taken. # NUTRITION MANUAL\nChapter XIV -Supplementary 2. Implementing supplementary 2.2 Supplementary feeding feeding programmes feeding programmes programme centres\n\n# Supervision\nSupervision permits the monitoring of benefi ciaries and their attendance at the centre, which also provides the data required to appraise the centre's effi ciency. # Monitoring benefi ciary status and progress\nThe nutritional status of benefi ciaries is measured at regular intervals (usually once a week), often on a rotating basis or during distribution in the case of take-away rations. Benefi ciaries and accompanying relatives must be informed of the date set for the check-up, and of the fact that the procedure takes time. In principle, an SFP targeting the moderately malnourished should lead to nutritional recovery, but -unlike therapeutic feeding centres -the feeding of benefi ciaries is not entirely controlled, thus complicating the issuing of recommendations as to weight gain. As an example, if a child weighing 10 kg upon admission must gain 2 kg in the centre, with a 700 kcal supplementary daily ration, it will gain approximately 14 g per kilogramme per day if the ration is used strictly for recovery (i.e."
