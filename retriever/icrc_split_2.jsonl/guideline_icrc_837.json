"the authorities have no viable alternatives to offer these populations. \n# Interactions Between the Different Types of Vulnerability\nThe number of different types of vulnerability, which encompass several levels of society, offers some idea of the complexity of the interactions between them. An example is population concentrations in areas with a strong probability of a major geophysical phenomenon (earthquake, volcanic eruption) occurring. Moving these populations elsewhere is practically unthinkable, not only for purely sociocultural reasons, but also -and especially -for economic reasons; this is true primarily of populations living close to volcanoes, 35 rivers, and deltas. 36 This interaction is still more complex when disasters give rise to mass population displacements; they break up the social fabric, cut people off from their normal sources of food, expose them to a new microbiological environment, etc."
