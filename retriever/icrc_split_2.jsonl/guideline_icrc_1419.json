"area is homogenous with respect to the variable under scrutiny. The observer places an empty bottle (or a pencil on a book) as close as possible to the centre of the area under consideration, spins it, and systematically selects all subjects in the direction indicated by the bottleneck, and as far as the area extends in that direction. If the number of subjects is insuffi cient, the exercise may be repeated as often as necessary. This method saves the effort and time required for census or accurate subject counting. Simple random sampling is illustrated in Figures 10.5 and 10.6 below."
