"slings in case of \u2026 minor mishaps during the weighing. In the case of particularly recalcitrant children, an adult scale may be used, and mothers are in this case weighed alone fi rst, and then with their child in order to deduct the mother's weight and thus obtain the child's. Children above 5 years of age should be weighed using adult scales or Salter-type spring balances of a 50-kg capacity and equipped with a horizontal bar that the child hangs from by the hands. There are different types of scales. Salter-type scales are most common and practical for children. Beam balances, usually equipped with a counterweight, are useful for adolescents and adults -such scales are found in most medical practices; spring balances and electronic scales may also be used."
