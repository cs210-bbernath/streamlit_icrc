"by the pressure it exerts on that environment through overpopulation. This interaction has disastrous consequences -for example, the pollution of drinking water by human waste and the exhaustion of energy resources (wood). This process is a vicious circle that should be broken quickly if health is to be preserved. Moreover, the interaction of population and environment can be very complex. Seldom is only one environmental factor involved in the transmission of communicable diseases. For example, water may be polluted at its source by human waste, or at the point of distribution, by hands soiled with fecal matter. The absence of personal hygiene may itself be a consequence of lack of water."
