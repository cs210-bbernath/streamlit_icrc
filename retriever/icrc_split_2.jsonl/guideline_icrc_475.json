"a sick person can expect initial contact with a non-professional. Oral rehydration and the treatment of fever and minor injuries are associated with this level. This type of care involves the family, community health workers, and traditional healers. \n# Secondary Level\nThe simple facility where a sick person comes into contact with a health-care professional constitutes the second level. Depending on the country, this may be a dispensary or a health center. Usually, curative services are limited to ambulatory care, but some health centers are equipped with a few beds. Depending on the competence of the personnel and the financial means available, the second level may offer the possibility of laboratory tests, though x-ray machines are rarely found in such facilities."
