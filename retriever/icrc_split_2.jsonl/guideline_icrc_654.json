"the limits of the 95% confidence interval (z = 1.96). In this case, the two populations will be deemed similar, as long as the difference between the values of the control population and those of the studied population remains within the confidence interval. However, if the value for the surveyed population exceeds these limits, the two populations must be considered different with respect to the variable under examination. Yet this difference cannot be accepted as certain, since, in the example above, there is still a 5% probability that the populations are similareven if the value of the population studied is outside the confidence interval, since this interval was defined with a confidence level of 95% (z = 1.96)."
