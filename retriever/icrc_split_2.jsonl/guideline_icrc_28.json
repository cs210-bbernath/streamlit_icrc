"Each delegate gives preference either to the curative component or to health promotion and preventive activities. # An exclusively curative MHU whose activities have little impact on the health of the population. A very large number of MHUs tend to drift towards the curative option, but we have never seen one drift towards health promotion and preventive activities. One feature common to any intermittent service is an influx of patients who expect the world of us, naturally including curative services."
