"a new pathogenic agent against which it has no immunity. 3\n\n# Susceptibility of the Population\nA population's susceptibility to disease is reflected at two levels: the population's immunity and the individual's immunity.  After several years in camps in Thailand, where antimalarial control is particularly strict, the Cambodians returning to Cambodia were exposed to Plasmodium falciparum, against which most of them had lost their natural immunity. \n# Immunity of the Population\nEvery community possesses a certain degree of immunity: ''There is nothing mysterious about the high resistance which certain groups of people have to particular diseases. It is a consequence of long continued exposure to a particular infection in any stable, relatively isolated community.'' 4 A population's resistance to a particular pathogenic agent depends on numerous factors, including the endemicity of the disease, and it is unequally distributed among the members of the population."
