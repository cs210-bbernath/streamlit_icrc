"On the other hand, it takes into account epidemiological data related to cancer risks and the continuous problems arising from vitamin A and iron defi ciencies, which may be resolved by consuming foodstuffs that are rich in carotene and ascorbic acid (WHO, 2003). # Flavour\nIn this framework, salt deserves to be quantifi ed; the WHO sets the upper limit for consumption at 6 g per day (WHO, 2003). # Special cases\nSugar and alcohol are popular foodstuffs that are both equally harmful if overindulged. # The themes of nutritional information 5.3 Diets\n\n# Sugar\nAs mentioned earlier, sugar should not account for more than 10% of the overall energy intake (WHO, 2003;WHO, 1988b). # Alcohol\nRather than ignoring alcohol deliberately because of its harmfulness in many respects, and in view of its widespread consumption in the world, this Manual prefers to set the upper limit for its consumption, which is identical to that for sugar. Alcohol should not account for more than 10% (ideally less, even not at all) of the average required overall energy intake of nutritionally healthy adults. With respect to an overall energy requirement of 2,400 kcal (10,000 kJ), being that of a lightly active adult male weighing 60 kg, this upper limit amounts to 240 kcal; this amount converts daily into 3 dl of wine, 7 dl of light beer (5% alcohol/volume), or 0.8 dl of liquor (40% alcohol/volume). # Application\nThe above principles provide a general framework for a dietetic approach to diets."
