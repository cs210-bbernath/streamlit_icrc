A satisfactory level permits survival in a natural environment, provided that living conditions are adequate; the latter are usually the object of other types of humanitarian attention. # OPERATIONAL PRIORITY\nTherapeutic feeding is a fl agship of humanitarian action that attracts prime-time media attention and shocks the public, politicians and donors alike. 3 See Chapter IX. A deteriorated nutritional status and its resulting malnutrition are both a pathology that calls for treatment, and the symptom of other disorders that have already upset the feeding process. The mere existence of a therapeutic feeding programme thus indicates the failure of effi cient prevention. Moreover, in the absence of prevention, therapeutic nutrition is pointless, and may even contradict humanitarian ethics: it is clearly unacceptable to treat and cure patients whose personal circumstances have caused their malnutrition, and who therefore risk relapse after their discharge. As a result, no overall operational strategy should be devised in response to severe malnutrition, but rather according to its causes and the problems that occur earlier in the process -and as far back as they can be addressed. As illustrated in Figure 13.2 below developed from the models suggested by Beghin and the UNICEF (Beghin, 1988;Alnwick, 1996), malnutrition comes last in the line of dysfunctions that can affect a population. # Figure 13.2 Causal model of malnutrition\nTherapeutic nutrition is by no means a priority in the operational strategy. High severe malnutrition rates may appear to call for the urgent introduction of therapeutic feeding and curative health programmes; the priority however is the earliest possible mastery of the main causes of this situation (such as economic insecurity, inadequate mother and child healthcare, and/or insuffi cient healthcare and environmental hygiene). This comprehensive approach is needed to avoid the saturation of curative care facilities, and limit post-treatment relapse; it is also a matter of common sense and humanitarian ethics. Therapeutic feeding programmes may obviously be set up in parallel, but fi eld workers must understand the fundamental contradiction between the strategy (i.e. long-term priorities) and the tactics that appear to be dictated by the emergency. There is no question that general food distribution (GFD) occupies the fi rst position in survival relief efforts, often alongside complementary prevention measures in the fi eld of water and habitat, healthcare and, possibly, economic support. That being said, therapeutic feeding may be necessary simply because prevention measures could not be taken early enough. In such circumstances, operating agencies face a timeframe of at most two months after the start of the therapeutic feeding programme to apply such measures -this timeframe corresponds to that required for the treatment of a malnourished individual and his discharge from the feeding centre while limiting the chances of relapse. # FEASIBILITY\nOnce the need for a therapeutic feeding programme has been established, its feasibility must be ascertained in terms of sustainability and the number of benefi ciaries. Its sustainability is determined by the following:\n9 benefi ciaries, allowing for their geographic dispersion (scattering), must have ready access to the TFC, without foreseeable hindrance; 9 security conditions must allow:\nq TFC staff to operate safely; q benefi ciaries to report to and be treated in the TFC safely; q uninterrupted supplies for the TFC; 9 fi nancial resources and means must be adequate in terms of staff, infrastructure, logistics, food and medicine, clothing and bedding, and the wherewithal required to complete the programme; 9 access to safe water must be suffi cient and regular. A programme is justifi ed as from a given number of benefi ciaries, which is determined by the magnitude of the malnutrition problem."
