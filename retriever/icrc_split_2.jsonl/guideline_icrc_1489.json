"value for the subject's height (in this case, 11 kg). The resulting weight-for-height index may then be expressed. This is done, as for all types of indexes, by way of units, which serve both to defi ne categories based upon cut-off points, and to locate a measurement accurately with respect to reference values. Nutritional anthropometry thus resorts to three types of units:\n9 percentage 9 centiles 9 standard deviation. \n# Percentage of the median\nResults are expressed as a percentage of the median in the reference population, and the formula is simple:\n-bserved value of the dependent variable - -----------------------------------\u00d7 \n\n# median reference value\nThe disadvantage of this unit is the fact that it does not have the same malnutrition meaning for all points of the independent variable because standard deviation varies according to points."
