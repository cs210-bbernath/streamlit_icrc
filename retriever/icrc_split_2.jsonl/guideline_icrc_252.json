". fecal contamination of water, consumption of which will give rise mainly to diarrheal diseases, hepatitis, and typhoid fever. Such contamination can occur at all levels of the water chain: at the source, during storage, during distribution, or upon use. For example, water may be contaminated at its source by an adjacent latrine, or by the use of careless methods of drawing water. . contamination of food, deficient personal hygiene (water can be contaminated by dirty hands), and/or the transmission of pathogens by insects such as mosquitoes which themselves are soiled with fecal matter. # Controlling the Problem\n& Control at the source: The aim is not to try to reduce the quantity of fecal matter produced, but rather to control its content, by screening healthy carriers and implementing mass prophylactic chemical measures. These activities will be studied in more detail in Chapter 4 (''Communicable Diseases''). & Proper disposal of human waste: In many parts of the world, particularly in rural areas, there is no sanitary infrastructure. 42 This lack means that fecal matter is scattered in the vicinity of people's dwellings, thereby increasing the risk of disease transmission. Numerous systems have been proposed for the proper disposal of human waste. For the sake of simplicity, they can be classified according to two basic principles:\n-whether or not storage is at the site of production; -whether storage is under dry or wet conditions. The combination of these two factors, as shown in the table, will determine the choice of the system most appropriate to the situation."
