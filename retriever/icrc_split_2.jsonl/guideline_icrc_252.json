"large enough to supply a whole city with drinking water. \n# Filtration\nThis section will discuss only the technique known as the slow sand filter, 29 and not the rapid sand filter, nor filtration through special materials (ceramic material, porous membranes, etc.). The sand filter is based on the principle of natural filtration through the soil. In this case, however, the soil is replaced by a layer of sand or alternate layers of sand, gravel, charcoal, etc., through which the untreated water passes. Contrary to what might be supposed, the main mode of action is not the mechanical filtration process, which is related to the size of the space between the grains of sand, 30 but rather the biological action that takes place in the top centimeters of the filter."
