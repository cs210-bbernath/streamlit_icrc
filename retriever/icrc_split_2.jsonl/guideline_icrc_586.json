"the nature of patients' wants in terms of the local economic and social context. # Paralytics\nAlthough paralytics may be less common than amputees, their problem is much harder to comprehend. The construction of specialized centers satisfies immediate needs, but does not always solve the problem in the long run, especially in developing countries, where paralytics find social reintegration difficult. # Mental Trauma\nTwo groups of people are particularly vulnerable to mental trauma: the victims of a disaster and humanitarian workers. # Victims\nThe causes of stress to victims are obvious -for example, the wait for aftershocks following the initial earthquake and the difficulties of daily life in the wake of a disaster (crowding, poor hygiene, the lack of elementary resources, etc.). 62 Refugee populations are particularly susceptible to psychosomatic complaints and psychological disturbances, owing to the disruption of their emotional, cultural, and economic environments, and to the feeling of being caught in an impasse.

In conflict situations, stress factors are even greater: personal experience of traumatizing events, the persistence of danger, insecurity."
