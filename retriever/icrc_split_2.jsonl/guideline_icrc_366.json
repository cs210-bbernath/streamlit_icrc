"out in Peru, 41% of patients discontinued treatment (12 months). The rate of abandonment depends not only on the length of treatment, but also on economic factors (access to medicine) and sociocultural factors (whether the patient belongs to a nomadic or resident population). Another aspect to be considered in tuberculosis is how quickly the treatment makes the patient's sputum negative. On average, after eight weeks of the short treatment the percentage of patients with negative sputum is 99%, while it is only 45-50% after eight weeks of traditional therapy. This is a key factor in a displaced-persons camp, where the reduction of transmission is a priority."
