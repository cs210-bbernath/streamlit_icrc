"survey is conducted during the fourth successive year of drought. Resilience to drought is determined by the main economic activities performed by the various population groups affected. The area under investigation accommodates three towns located on major international communication routes, six rural dwellings located along a river, camps that house nomads displaced by the drought and located on the outskirts of towns, and nomad pastoralist camps near remaining watering points in the semi-arid and arid areas. Three population types are defi ned according to where they live, their relative vulnerability to drought being related to their proximity to the drought-stricken area; livelihood independence with respect to drought is assumed to determine resilience to drought (working hypothesis)."
