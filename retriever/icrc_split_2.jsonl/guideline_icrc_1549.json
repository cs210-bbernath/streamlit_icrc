"Exceptionally, sick, helpless, or absent individuals may be registered provisionally, provided that the reasons are valid (for example, persons who have had to remain in the village or neighbourhood to watch over it in the absence of its population), but each case must be verifi ed independently. The population must understand that only individuals who have reported and been registered on the set date will receive assistance, and that no exception other than those stated above will be made. Concessions are a sure way of losing control, and make the whole exercise pointless or even counter-productive."
