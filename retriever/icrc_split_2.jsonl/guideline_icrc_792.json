"The use of local resources (personnel, material resources), though they may be available on the spot, requires the mobilization of specific financial resources -which may be lacking. The role of humanitarian relief is to mitigate these deficiencies. # Financial means\nAs mentioned, this factor is often the common denominator of all the others. However, direct financial aid in cases of disaster is not as common as might be imagined. Indeed, to apply financial means immediately to urgent needs, the necessary resources (material, logistic, and personnel) must be available in the country -something which is by no means always the case. Donors prefer to import the necessary resources directly, both for reasons of efficiency and in their own interests, rather than to give local authorities the financial wherewithal to buy abroad and import what they lack. Nonetheless, the humanitarian agencies do employ this means of intervention, on a limited scale. They may, for example, undertake to pay the salaries of the local personnel recruited for the emergency situation. Another possibility is meeting the needs of the victims by providing them with direct financial support. 29 This option is often used on a case-by-case basis to help individuals or families through a difficult period. There have been few instances, however, of direct financial interventions 30 within a population. This approach is worth examining, if the material resources the victims lack are available on the spot. In most emergency situations, it is in fact the loss of purchasing power that is the victims' main problem, staple goods being available elsewhere in the country. 31 . # Material means\nMaterial aid may have unfortunate economic or ethical consequences. . Economic consequences -Mass food distributions in a still-productive agricultural environment cause a drop in food prices. This drop benefits neither the victims 32 nor the local farmers, since the latter can no longer sell their produce at a reasonable price. Buying large quantities of food products locally can have the opposite effect, by creating shortages on the local market."
