"Vitamin A capsules can contain 10,000, 100,000, or 200,000 IU. In the absence of 100,000 IU capsules for infants between 6 and 12 months, a 200,000 IU capsule may be punctured to extract three drops. \n# External parasites\nFleas and lice are haematophagic dipterans (blood-sucking parasites) whose bite is often infl ammatory and pruriginous, and causes dermatosis and itching. The insects multiply and transmit quickly and spread infection. Lice transmit exanthematic typhus and cosmopolitan recurrent fever; fl eas transmit murine typhus, the plague, and two types of tenia. Patients must therefore be treated against these parasites upon admission to the TFC with pyrethroid insecticide (0.5% permethrin), and their clothing must be steamed (pyrethroid insecticide in the case of wool garments)."
