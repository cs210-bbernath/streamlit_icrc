"This is noted especially in the case of food rations that combine cereals and legumes. The proportion between protein and energy is expressed as a percentage of the energy value 11 of the protein and the overall energy supply: this is the \"P/E%\" ratio below. # G \u00d7 Kp P/E% = --------------\u00d7 100 Kr\nWhere: G = the protein weight in the ration K = the calorie value Kp = the calorie value of the protein contained in the ration (kcal/gram, or kJ/gram) Kr = the overall calorie value of the ration (kcal or kJ)\nFor example, a ration that supplies 2,400 kcal (10,032 kJ) in total, with 70 g of protein, translates into the following P/E% ratio: --------------------\u00d7 100 = 11.7 % 2,400 kcal A P/E% ratio of 10 to 13% is usually adequate to satisfy protein requirements, provided that energy requirements are met. The P/E% ratio of cereals is approximately 11%, that of legumes at least 23%. Practically then, a ration that supplies 65% of its energy in cereals, 20% in oil, and 15% in legumes amounts to a P/E% of 11.5%. If the ration supplies 20% of its energy in the form of oil, and the remainder in cereals only (i.e. to the exclusion of legumes), the P/E% drops to 9% or below. The proportion of legumes to be included in order to cover protein requirements must always be 10 to 15% of the overall energy supply. 12\n\n# g \u00d7 4 kcal/g P/E% = -\nSetting full rations usually involves the inclusion of other foodstuffs in order to supply micronutrients and improve their diversity and fl avour."
