"must be considered as back-up support for local mutual-aid systems. Rehabilitating the facilities damaged by the disaster must be part of the emergency strategy. In the short run, it is more efficient and less expensive to repair a water-supply system than to settle for distributing water from tanker trucks. The two measures can obviously be combined. Similarly, agricultural rehabilitation programs are essential to take over from food distribution programs. Reconstruction cannot be undertaken without preliminary identification of the areas of vulnerability that gave way under the shock of the initial phenomenon. The reduction of vulnerability is the link permitting the transition from emergency programs per se (aid, rehabilitation) to a development program that will undertake the changes needed to reduce vulnerability."
