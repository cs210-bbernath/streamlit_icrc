"This chain can be shown more generally as a spiral (see chart). # Possible Responses\nThe responses possible in a disaster situation can be classified in terms of the formula discussed earlier:  \n\n# Responses to the Initial Phenomenon\nEarthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and climatic disturbances (rain, cyclones) cannot be prevented, though cyclones and rain can be predicted, as can earthquakes (with considerably less accuracy, however). The effectiveness of early-warning systems depends on both the reliability of the prediction and the degree to which populations have been prepared to respond to instructions given in cases of alert. # Responses to the Impact\nIn the course of the preceding chapters, the strategies and techniques of assistance have been discussed in detail."
