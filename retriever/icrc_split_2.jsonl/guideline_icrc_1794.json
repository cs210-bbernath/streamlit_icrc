"Both theory and practice have sometimes led to disaster when the basic ration was inadequate (or even non-existent), and supplementary feeding programmes in fact supplemented very little, if anything. The consequence was a real eye-opener: the basis for relief, in an acute nutritional crisis, must be adequate GFD (IDS, 1986). In this case, SFPs become redundant, except at the very beginning of the intervention, until the GFD logistics set-up is effective, or if the GFD (albeit adequate to cover maintenance needs) does not allow nutritional recovery. Practice has not always followed, and still does not, because many agencies implementing GFDs still rely on SFPs to complement their input. Moreover, SFPs continue to mushroom owing to the fact that many agencies have specialized in this type of programme. The aims and relevance of SFPs in crisis situations therefore need to be carefully scrutinized."
