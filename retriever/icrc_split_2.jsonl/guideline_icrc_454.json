"The determining threshold for an epidemic may be:\n. a cumulative incidence higher than 100/100,000;\n. a doubling of cases from one week to the next;\n. a rate of attack higher than 15 cases per week for two weeks. The procedure for organizing an immunization campaign need not be reviewed here, since the problems are similar for every disease. # Cases Presenting a Biological Reaction\nIt is unrealistic to try to treat subjects showing meningococcus in a throat culture. There is thought to be no relation between the number of carriers and the imminence of an epidemic. 111 \n\n# Managing Cases of Meningococcal Meningitis Diagnosing Cases\nThe clinical diagnosis of meningitis is based on a group of known symptoms, but differential diagnosis is complicated by a number of competing syndromes. If lumbar puncture produces purulent cerebrospinal fluid, meningitis of bacterial origin can be diagnosed; but clinical examination cannot confirm a diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis unless purpura is present. In an emergency situation, health-care workers do not necessarily have access to a laboratory capable of identifying meningococcus in the cerebrospinal fluid. Agglutination techniques can be used to differentiate meningococcus from the germs responsible for other types of purulent meningitis. The health-care team may need to aim for greater or lesser diagnostic exactitude depending on whether it is facing one or two isolated cases or an already confirmed epidemic. For isolated cases, an etiological diagnosis is essential in order to detect the beginning of an epidemic and to initiate not only the appropriate treatment for the patient, but preventive measures for the population. For cases in a confirmed epidemic, all patients presenting a meningeal syndrome can be assumed a priori to have meningococcal meningitis. Naturally, if all the facilities necessary for bacteriological tests are available, it is wise to seek confirmation for each case. # Treating Patients\nTreatment with an injection of an oily suspension of chloramphenicol is effective against meningococcal meningitis. 112 This is consequently the antibiotic of choice in an epidemic. A single injection is certainly preferable to ampicillin, which requires several injections a day and costs ten times more than treatment with chloramphenicol. On the other hand, chloramphenicol is not very effective against other forms of bacterial meningitis (H. influenzae, streptococcus, pneumococcus, etc.)."
