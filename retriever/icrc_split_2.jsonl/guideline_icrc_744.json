"respect to management, the participation of the population and self-management. One of the basic principles of PHC is maximal delegation of responsibility to the population itself. In theory, this principle also applies in emergency situations: from the beginning of an intervention, the displaced or refugee population should be called upon to help take charge of its own health problems. It must be recognized, however, that on many occasions solutions are simply imposed upon the victims. There is thus a notorious difference between emergency situations and the practice of PHC under normal circumstances. 8 The ultimate goal is self-management of PHC programs by the population itself; the population furnishes the financial and human resources, and therefore decides the program's orientation."
