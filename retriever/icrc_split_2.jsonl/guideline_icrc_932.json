"Applications\n\n# Protection of Civilian Populations\nCivilian populations are doubly affected by armed conflicts -directly, by the attacks on them, and indirectly, by the deterioration of the essential services on which their survival depends: agriculture, medical services, water supply services. Moreover, civilian populations are often forcibly displaced and their fundamental rights are violated (summary executions, abductions, etc.). The use of legal instruments can have a decisive impact on the intervention strategy used in the field of health.
