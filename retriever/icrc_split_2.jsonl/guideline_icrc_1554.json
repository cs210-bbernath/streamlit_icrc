"the best timeframe for the availability and use of resources. \n# ALLOWING FOR ADJUSTMENT\nIt may seem strange to allow for adjustment; this aspect, in spite of being the corollary of monitoring and evaluation, is frequently overlooked because of routine and/or because the history of past experiences is lost, and adapting an operation usually entails costs in terms of resources and additional effort. Adjustment or adaptation is therefore often resisted wrongly. Allowing for adjustments is however essential, and simply consists in the regular and timely review of monitoring and evaluation results, in order to determine whether actual adjustments are required or not."
