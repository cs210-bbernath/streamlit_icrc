"that the absence of chemical thiamine should not discourage action. Furthermore, if beriberi is suspected in a hospital or dispensary, then perfusions containing sugars (e.g. dextrose) must be combined with thiamine supplementation of at least 10 mg/day. Sweetened intravenous solutions are likely to cause an increase of the energy metabolism and, thus, raise thiamine requirements. Sweetened perfusions administered without thiamine are therefore likely to precipitate beriberi in cases of marginal defi ciency, not to mention the disastrous consequences on declared but undetected cases. Beriberi usually accompanies severe malnutrition, and even often causes it. But it also frequently combines with other specifi c defi ciencies, particularly those in other B-group vitamins."
