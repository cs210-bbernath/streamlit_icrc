"crucial earlier stages of the feeding process that affect adults. However, these are precisely the stages that shed light on the individual and overall nutritional condition. This restrictive approach also implies that, in the absence of infant malnutrition, there is no nutritional problem -it may however exist already, and simply not manifest itself in the nutritional status at this stage. Nutritional assessment can clearly be limited deliberately to measuring the nutritional status with a specifi c purpose; in such cases, it should be labelled according to its objective. Nutritional assessment, strictly speaking, appraises the nutritional condition of a given population, and this includes the following: the state of nutritional needs, the performance of the feeding process, the nutritional status proper, recent developments in the nutritional situation, and predictions as to future developments, according to the seasonal or cyclical milestones that infl uence the performance of the feeding process."
