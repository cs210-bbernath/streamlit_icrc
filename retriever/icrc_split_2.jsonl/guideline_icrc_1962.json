This phase usually lasts 2 weeks during which at least 75% of the diet must be identical to the patient's normal diet, the nutritional status must remain stable, and possible health problems must have been resolved. During the fi rst week of this preparation for discharge, meals are reduced to four per day, two of which are normal, one consists of milk, and the last of porridge; during the second week, three normal meals are combined with one meal of porridge or milk."
