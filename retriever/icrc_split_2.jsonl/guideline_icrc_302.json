"The importance of this is evident when target populations must be identified for specific forms of intervention. # Increased Transmission\nSeveral factors contribute to an increase in disease transmission, particularly:\n& overcrowding -The concentration of a group of people in a restricted space presents an obvious risk of epidemics. & deterioration of hygienic conditions -Lack of water for basic hygiene, accumulations of waste which encourage the proliferation of disease vectors, and the absence of sanitation measures are all factors that help increase the transmission of communicable diseases. # Deterioration of Health Services\nThe deterioration of health services affects disease transmission at all levels. For example, no vaccinations are given, vector-control programs deteriorate, and little or no care is provided for the sick. Thus, not only do the risks increase in an emergency situation (fertile breeding ground for infections, increased transmission), but, in addition, the means of disease control are usually inadequate, if not nonexistent. All these factors contribute, in varying degrees, to an increased incidence of communicable diseases (sometimes to the point of actual epidemics), as well as to a greater severity of clinical manifestations, reflected in the mortality rates for specific infections. 7\n\n# II. Coping with Communicable Diseases in Emergencies\nThe difficulty in coping with communicable diseases lies in the diversity of diseases likely to pose problems in emergencies, as well as in the interaction of risk factors. A clear plan of action should be adopted, based on the natural cycle of communicable disease; that cycle will determine the different levels of intervention. In February, 1985, in the refugee camps in eastern Sudan, mortality rates for measles, diarrheal illnesses, and respiratory infections were 16/1000/month, 8/1000/month, and 2/1000/month, respectively.
