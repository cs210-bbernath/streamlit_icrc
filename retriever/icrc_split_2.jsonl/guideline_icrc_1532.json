"Donors must therefore be persuaded of the minimum level of assistance required in the given circumstances. # Feasibility\nIt may be diffi cult to single out specifi c households within a given community. The exercise entails two major challenges. The fi rst relates to the targeting itself, which may not be acceptable to the community and/or their leaders. Some cultures require that assistance be shared among all members of the community, and targeting specifi c households is pointless in this case. Such cultures usually rest upon strong social obligations, and the redistribution of wealth to the poor is automatic; reciprocity mechanisms are strongly respected in such settings and, even in the case of targeting, redistribution will probably occur. Field workers must be aware that recipient communities may pretend to abide by the process -if this sets the condition for receiving the goods -and later will do what they consider best, regardless of the operating agency's own objectives. The most needy may precisely be marginalized and ostracized within their own community for social, cultural, or political reasons; alternatively, those who receive State salaries (such as public servants or members of the armed forces) may be excluded."
