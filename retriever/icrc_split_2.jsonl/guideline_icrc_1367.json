"Violence 2. Rights relating to nutrition 2.4 International humanitarian law may be tolerated, but only in its legal, military form. Not only must civilians not be mishandled, but \"collateral\" damage in the exercise of \"legitimate\" violence must also be avoided as much as possible. This implies, among others, that indiscriminate weapons not be used, and the choice of proportionate force with respect to a given military target, in order to minimize incidental civilian losses and damage. The principle of proportionality, which is also accepted as compelling, in fact imposes that belligerents refrain from attack on military targets if foreseeable civilian incidental damage is excessive with respect to the military importance of the target. The prohibition of the use of starvation against civilians as a means of warfare is stated in Protocol I (article 54) and Protocol II (article 14); it is completed by many provisions that contribute to its application. The 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 are more specifi c in this respect than the Conventions that provide their basis: the problems had grown clearer in the meantime. For instance, the prohibition of starvation as a means of warfare is translated into the prohibition of specifi c types of behaviour, and leads to the special protection of objects that are indispensable to the survival of the civilian population; likewise, such objects (like any civilian property) must not be made the object of reprisals according to article 54 of Protocol I. Protocol I indicates that protected objects may be used in part for the sustenance for the members of armed forces; however, in no event shall actions against these objects be taken which may be expected to leave civilians with such inadequate food or water as to cause their starvation or force their movement. (article 53, paragraph 3 b)."
