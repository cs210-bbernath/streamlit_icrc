"been suggested for rapid rural appraisal or \"RRA\" (McCracken, 1988). \n# Optimal ignorance\nThis concept rests upon the idea that only the information that is strictly necessary should be sought, and no more. This concept is simple to grasp, and its application is important, but this is not always easily done. The idea is for preliminary appraisal to enable rapid response in order to avert the deterioration, or the continued deterioration, of a situation. Data to be collected must therefore be limited to the strict minimum required for decision-making. To this end, assessment must follow a plan, and not seek information blindly."
