"sent to all the governments signatory to the Geneva Conventions. The ICRC employs the last option only with the greatest caution, to preserve its effect and keep it from being seen as a political stand. Generally speaking, the ICRC does not make its observations public. Indeed, its role is not to denounce violations of international humanitarian law, but rather to help the parties to a conflict to apply the law. This being said, the ICRC reserves the right to take a public stand if its requests are not met and if doing so is in the interest of the victims."
