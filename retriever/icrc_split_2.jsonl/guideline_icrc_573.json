"an increased number of infected wounds (if evacuation is slow). The absence or mediocrity of an advance medical post and of means of medical transport will have the same effect. The quality of surgical intervention definitely affects the survival rate of the most serious cases, as well as the degree to which a functional handicap can be reduced after the injury heals -that is, whether or not a hand, a limb, etc., can be used or not. In developing countries, where the mechanisms of mutual social aid do not facilitate reintegration into society, a handicap may doom its owner to begging for a living."
