"Neither can they take credit for the distribution, or help themselves to commodities during or after the distribution. # The role of staff in charge of distribution\nThe staff in charge of the distribution has two main and equally essential roles. The fi rst is to ensure the smooth conduct of the distribution itself. The second involves the understanding of the following parameters in their broadest sense:\n9 the population, its reactions, and its needs for assistance; 9 the impact and effects of the GFD, as well as possible associated or resulting problems arising from organizational issues; 9 new developments in the situation. This understanding develops through organized surveys, informal and spontaneous discussion, and the ability to observe and to listen. The staff in charge of distribution is by defi nition in close contact with the fi eld; as such, it is well placed to analyse and provide the information that is relevant to humanitarian action."
