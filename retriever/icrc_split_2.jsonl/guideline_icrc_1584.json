"# Location\nThere must be no possible confusion as to where the distribution will take place. # Attendance\nIn some cases, it may be best that all benefi ciaries attend, and assistance only be delivered to persons who are present accordingly (especially if attempts at abuse have been noted). Distributing agencies may on the other hand choose to meet only cardholders accompanied by a limited number of their relatives who are there to help the cardholder transport the distributed goods. 34 The extent of required attendance is also determined by the other types of activity that may be conducted at the same time as the GFD, such as child vaccination, nutritional measurement, or vitamin A supplementation. What matters here is that the modalities of the distribution and, in particular, its associated attendance requirements be made clear beforehand. # Material required of benefi ciaries\nIn principle, distributing agencies do not supply the material required for carrying assistance items away. Recipients must therefore be told clearly what type of material they must bring to the distribution; however, distributing agencies must always keep some packing material for the completely destitute, but this must however remain the exception. # Ration type and size\nRecipients must understand their entitlements, in order for them to organize their transport. # Distribution modalities\nRecipients must be aware of distribution modalities, what other activities will be taking place at the same time where relevant, and what they are expected to do; this saves considerable time and effort at the beginning of the distribution itself, and limits disorder. # Organizing the distribution\n\n# Work plans\nDistribution follows a plan, according to distribution points and benefi ciary groups. Available means must permit distribution rounds to be carried out as planned, and be fl exible enough to allow for unexpected delays (uncertainty is practically the rule in humanitarian action). For example, the use\n\n# NUTRITION MANUAL\nChapter XII -General food distribution 3. GFD implementation 3.5 Distribution modalities of six distribution points, of which each serves two recipient groups on a fortnightly distribution basis, implies that each round be conducted in less than a fortnight, and that each group receive its rations every fortnight. If one group is served per day, then the round would be completed in 12 days; this is too long for a fortnightly cycle, because it leaves no leeway for unexpected delays. If on the other hand two groups are served every day, then the round would be completed in 6 days (for example, 4 days during the fi rst week and 2 days during the following week). This would allow for delays, the drafting of reports, monitoring, the organization of the following round, the maintenance of vehicles, materials, and warehouses and, if necessary, would even permit the postponing of a given distribution."
