"large, for example in the case of an entire region. The method involves dividing a geographical area that is homogenous with respect to the variable under consideration into comparable clusters (usually along administrative or geographical lines), sampling some of these clusters randomly, and measuring subjects within the sampled clusters. All the clusters are represented graphically on a map and numbered; then, the number of clusters -referred to as \"k\" -to be assessed are chosen randomly. In order to choose the subjects, the sample size \"n\" is divided by \"k\" (the number of clusters to be assessed), which gives the number of subject to select in each chosen cluster."
