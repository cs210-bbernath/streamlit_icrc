"An average composition that is representative of all groups living in a given situation must therefore be defi ned. This defi nition results in two profi les: one applies to economically developed countries, and the other to underdeveloped or developing countries. These two profi les are provided in Table 12.2 below. # Average weight per age and sex group\nThe population must be divided into age and sex groups, because these groups correspond to different average weights, and because basal metabolisms differ according to weight and sex. What matters here is the average weight per group or stratum, and it may differ signifi cantly between populations of adolescents and adults. In Table 12.2, adult men included in the WHO 1 population weigh 65 kg on average, and women 55 kg. In the WHO 2 population, men weigh 60 kg, and women 52 kg. In the WHO 3 population, men weigh 67 kg, and women 58 kg. Latham, for his part, suggests a reference population in which the average adult male weight is 63 kg, and 55 kg for women, in developing countries (Latham, 1997). # Physical activity\nThe level of physical activity infl uences energy expenditures (and, hence, energy requirements) signifi cantly. The basal metabolism is multiplied to calculate energy requirements according to the level of physical activity. WHO proposes the use of the following multiplication factors for calculating average daily energy requirements according to physical activity (WHO, 1985): Ambient temperature Ambient temperature infl uences energy requirements 14 substantially. The lower the temperature, the higher the energy cost of thermo-genesis."
