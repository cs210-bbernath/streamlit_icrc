"The usual system is no longer functioning, or the populations no longer have access to it the victims become chronic aid recipients who will gradually lose any sense of being autonomous within a system of their own. Everybody is happy -both the humanitarian agencies, who are able to demonstrate their efficiency, and the victims, who little by little will come to consider the emergency system as a normal way of meeting their essential needs. # The emergency system is established AUTONOMOUSLY\nEmergency interventions are often necessary, of course, and no criticism of them is intended here; but if the emergency should necessitate the establishment of an artificial system that takes the place of the usual systems, then the emergency strategy absolutely must reflect a long-term perspective aiming at the eventual restoration of the original systems. # Rehabilitation as a Form of Emergency Intervention\nIf the link between the victims and the local systems still exists, and the dysfunction of the latter is linked to material supply problems or a temporary lack of personnel, as may be the case for hospitals and water supply stations, for example, then an intervention to rehabilitate the local systems will be e n o u g h t o s o l v e t h e problem. Rehabilitation comes under the heading of emergency strategy. # Combining Direct Aid and Rehabilitation Programs\nWhen the problems involved require major rehabilitation interventions, it will be necessary to combine emergency interventions in the form of direct aid to the victims (food distribution, medical care) with rehabilitation programs that will take over as soon as the local systems have been restored to their former operational level. These two kinds of programs are part of a well-planned emergency strategy, in which the mediumt e r m s o l u t i o n i s anticipated from the beginning of the intervention. # Distinction Between Rehabilitating and Developing Local Systems\nRehabilitation consists in restoring local systems. Clearly, if those systems suffer from major deficiencies which make them particularly vulnerable, the question may arise whether rehabilitating them is appropriate, or whether perhaps they should be structurally modified to make them more effective. In this case, real development programs must be envisaged, comprising two lines of action. One will involve examining system vulnerability, determining corrective measures, and applying them; the other will seek to develop existing local capacities and give the local personnel responsibility for implementing all stages of the programs. Overall, development programs should help raise people's standard of living and make them less vulnerable to disasters. The number of natural disasters continues to increase as years go by, as does their impact on the socioeconomic sector, 53 leading to an ever-widening gap between the needs of the vulnerable groups and the local capacity to meet them. The reasons for this growing gap should be sought in the deteriorating economic situation of many developing countries, the degeneration of the environment, migration to the cities, increased technological risks, and the burden of demographic growth, which forces entire populations to move into high-risk areas."
