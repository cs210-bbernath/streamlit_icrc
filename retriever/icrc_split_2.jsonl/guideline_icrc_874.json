"protect an appropriate political social and economic order for development.   \n\n# Disasters and Human-Rights Law\nThe connection between disasters and human rights is clear. The sight of injured people, malnourished children, populations uprooted from their homes in the wake of catastrophe, usually unleashes an international reaction based on the prime human right: the right to life. Emergency relief is the best way of insuring survival and the restoration of living conditions to what they were before the disaster. Unfortunately, these conditions are usually precarious, constantly in danger of tipping over into emergency again. Emergency situations have the merit of pinpointing the most vulnerable population groups, who will not escape the poverty cycle without the help of a serious development policy."
