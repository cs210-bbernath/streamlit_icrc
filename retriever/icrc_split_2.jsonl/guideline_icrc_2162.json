"the specifi cations and quality of the donation are met. Metric measuring containers should accompany the fi rst food donation. These will assist in identifying local containers, which have equivalent volume and so ensure adequate equal rations. Provision of fuel and improvement to the water supply must at times be considered. ICRC/League and National Societies should consult a local institute, which has experience in local appropriate methods to fi nd a realistic solution. This problem is particularly important when disaster victims migrate and congregate. Cooking utensils for family use, of the type commonly used, should be provided. Displaced and refugee families are most likely to be in need."
