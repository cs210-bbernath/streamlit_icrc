"Although a number of different chemical products may be used for this purpose, they are all generally referred to as ''chlorine.'' Two points are important here:\nOnly free chlorine has a disinfectant action. Chlorine links with organic particles and is neutralized by the combination. Chlorine must therefore be added until all the organic particles in the water have been oxidized; 33 only then is free chlorine released in the water, allowing disinfection to begin. The effective dose of free chlorine is 0.5 mg/l, acting over a period of half an hour. There are numerous ways of measuring free chlorine in the water, colorimetric methods being the easiest and least expensive to use."
