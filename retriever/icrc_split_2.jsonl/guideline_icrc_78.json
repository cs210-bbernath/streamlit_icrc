"Do not leave analysis until the end of the assessment. The one exception to this rule concerns analysis of sectoral information. If the team does not include specialists, information relating to a particular sector should be analysed whenever possible by the relevant specialist after the assessment is over. Once it comes to the project design in a specialized field, consultation with specialists is required. This section provides advice on: I resolving inconsistencies in the information that you collect; I summarizing information; I synthesizing information from different sources in order to reach conclusions; I making recommendations for the future; I drafting an assessment report. # Inconsistent information\nIn any assessment, you will be faced with the problem of inconsistent information. This arises when informants provide different answers to the same question. For example: I One person tells you that the water source runs dry for two months of the year, whilst another tells you that it never runs dry. I One person tells you that all the animals from the village are dead. Another tells you that half of the animals are alive and grazing far away. There are some measures you can take to minimize and resolve such inconsistencies. The first is to think about the information as you collect it. This helps to spot inconsistencies. Ask yourself the following questions: I Does the new information support or contradict secondary information? I Does information gathered from one informant support or contradict information from another? I Is the information collected by different members of the assessment team consistent? I Does the information \"make sense\"? For example, if someone tells you that the crop yield was zero, yet you see freshly harvested corn in the village, there is an inconsistency. Asking yourself these questions leads you to think of new questions to ask community members or to look for alternative information sources to clarify the situation."
