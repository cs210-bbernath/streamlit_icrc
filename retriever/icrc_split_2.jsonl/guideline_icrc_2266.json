In the absence of laboratory facilities to analyse stool and if dysentery persists in spite of antibiotic treatment, amoebiasis or giardiasis should be suspected -both are treated orally with metronidazole, as per the posology provided in Table 13.9 below. \n\n# Nematodes\nNematodes include intestinal roundworms (ascaris, Ascaris Lumbricoides), hookworms (ankylostomes, Ancylostoma Duodenale or Necator Americanus), and pinworms (oxyures, Enterobius Vermicularis). Nematode infection is so common that it should be treated systematically. However, the treatment is too brutal to be administered during initial treatment; it should only be administered once patients have progressed into rehabilitation, usually one week after admission."
