"In endemic areas, blood testing should be systematic for any fever that exceeds 38.5\u00b0C. If testing material is not available, persistent fever must be treated in the absence of other signs of bacterial infection, as must fever that persists in spite of antibiotic treatment. Malaria treatment should follow national health and/ or WHO protocols."
