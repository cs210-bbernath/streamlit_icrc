"Here again, transparency and dialogue are crucial. The issue must be addressed directly with such armed groups, and resolved jointly if possible; however, consensus, compromise and dialogue are frequently impossible in such circumstances. This must also be acknowledged, and more radical solutions may then be necessary. However, the effi ciency of humanitarian agencies is often determined by their ability to persuade, and radical measures can involve withdrawal and abandoning the victims. The risks deserve thorough thought in order to reach the best possible compromise, which is acceptable for all. Clearly, agencies should refrain from doing too much in order to remain in the picture: in extreme circumstances withdrawal pure and simple is the only ethical option. Humanitarian agencies are not in principle to blame for a crisis situation, and their staff should not automatically feel guilty for their inability to act. Agencies whose staff is murdered usually withdraw for a long time, and risks should never be taken unnecessarily. This is an ethical issue concerning both humanitarian staff (local and expatriate) and victims."
