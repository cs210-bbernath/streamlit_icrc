"The collected data must then be processed and analysed in order to reach operational conclusions; results must be presented clearly in writing, thus enabling the planning of the next steps of the operation while at the same time providing a document for future reference if necessary. Like nutritional vulnerability studies, 2 nutritional assessment often suffers from a harmful narrowness of mind. For many, it is restricted to measuring the nutritional status of a population sample in order to determine the prevalence of malnutrition among children under the age of 6 years. This assumes on the one hand that malnutrition rates and small children are the two objects that really matter and, on the other, that the knowledge of this rate enables the appraisal of the nutritional condition of the overall population. These assumptions have serious consequences, because they confi ne possible nutritional problems to the realm of infant malnutrition, and ignore the crucial earlier stages of the feeding process that affect adults. However, these are precisely the stages that shed light on the individual and overall nutritional condition. This restrictive approach also implies that, in the absence of infant malnutrition, there is no nutritional problem -it may however exist already, and simply not manifest itself in the nutritional status at this stage. Nutritional assessment can clearly be limited deliberately to measuring the nutritional status with a specifi c purpose; in such cases, it should be labelled according to its objective. Nutritional assessment, strictly speaking, appraises the nutritional condition of a given population, and this includes the following: the state of nutritional needs, the performance of the feeding process, the nutritional status proper, recent developments in the nutritional situation, and predictions as to future developments, according to the seasonal or cyclical milestones that infl uence the performance of the feeding process. In addition, assessment should not be undertaken in the absence of the appropriate means to act upon observations, or of another agency in a position to step in."
