"# Distribution of food rations\nTake-away rations\nIn the case of take-away rations, benefi ciaries and accompanying relatives must be aware that it is their responsability to provide containers, which should not preclude the storage of bags to assist those who have forgotten theirs or do not have any. Distribution should not be more frequent than once a week, nor less frequent than once a fortnight."
