In the Somali famine of the 1990s, for example, a completely exhausted displaced group that faced signifi cant mortality claimed to have lost everything (including the hope of return), and believed it was permanently condemned to dependency on humanitarian aid. Two months later, the survivors approached assistance teams in order to negotiate the delivery of resettlement assistance to those who could return home in time for the harvest, whereas those who could not would continue to receive assistance on-site."
