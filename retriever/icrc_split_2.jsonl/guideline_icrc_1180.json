"iodine, which is necessary for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. A daily iodine intake that is lower than 50 \u03bcg is considered to be insuffi cient in adults. The thyroid is located at the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. According to the severity of defi ciency, the goitre may cause a slight, unobtrusive or large (larger than 1 litre) and highly visible swelling. It may be soft or nodular; the latter indicates long-term defi ciency. The goitre is detected by palpating the base of the neck: goitre is diagnosed when each of the thyroid lobes is larger than the patient's terminal thumb phalanx."
