"# Weight\nWeight must be established to evaluate ponderal growth and corpulence. The measurement of weight provides an approximation of nutritional reserves; but the measurement of weight involves measuring the entire organism, including: 9 intestinal parasites, which may be likened to antimatter because they are counted as nutritional reserves when they, in fact, consume part of the food and nutritional reserves; the burden of intestinal worms can exceed 1 kg; 9 sub-clinical oedema, which is an accumulation of fl uid; 9 abnormal liver and spleen enlargement (hepatomegaly and splenomegaly) -splenomegaly is particularly common where malaria is endemic; 9 non-oedematous fl uid accumulation associated with infection and infl ammation (parasite infl ammation can double the weight of the intestine); 9 body waste that has not yet been excreted. Moreover, moderate dehydration can also cause weight to be underestimated."
