"trees illustrate the different stages of decision-making according to circumstances. They are used to design a plan to achieve an objective. They also serve as models for decision-making, for example in a surveillance system, and to defi ne diagnoses. As such, they are designed to facilitate decision-making. Figure 10.19 below provides an example of a decision tree. \n\n# CHECKLISTS\nChecklists are good reminders of all the different aspects that must not be omitted in an assessment. It is therefore useful to consult them while preparing the assessment, in order not to forget anything, but also after each survey, or data collection exercise, to confi rm that all their points have indeed been covered, or explore avenues related to points that were previously not included in the lists."
