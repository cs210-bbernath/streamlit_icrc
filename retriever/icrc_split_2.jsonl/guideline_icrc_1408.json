"In such cases, it is best to rely on several donors with different interests, in order to preserve operational independence. # Setting up logistics\nThe three criteria for good logistics are the fi nal delivery of quality material, as fast as possible, and at the lowest possible cost. However, these three criteria are not necessarily compatible. Fast delivery and quality are not usually cheap, and emergency may impose compromises. Consequently, logistics staff must be informed of criteria ranking as early as possible in order to clarify their operational constraints. Furthermore, \"cheaper\" may not necessarily mean \"less costly\": for example, a bean consignment may be obtained at a very low price, but require sorting and repacking, say with a 25% loss, and this would have to be taken into account. Another logistical challenge is commodity storage and turnover; this implies that warehouse capacity permits the storage of reserves in anticipation of \"pipeline\" disorders. The rate of supply must also match the rate of distribution, allow for the most appropriate reserves, and follow the \"fi rst in/fi rst out\" principle. The greater the reserves, the more variable the commodity fl ow can be, and the lower the risk of shortages is; however in that case, storage conditions also require more attention, in order to prevent the deterioration of the commodities. On the other hand, the smaller the reserves, the more constrained the commodity fl ow is because of the greater risk of shortage; however, spoilage related to storage is of course less likely. Large, immobile stocks are expensive, and generate signifi cant risks in terms of commodity expiry, lack of use and theft. Humanitarian agencies must accept these dangers: limiting stocks reduces risks and costs for the operating agency, but exposes victims to the risk of shortage. Humanitarian action deals with uncertainty, and the best possible compromise must therefore be found -this is usually based on experience. The effi ciency of logistical support is contingent upon the information necessary to plan ahead, in order to organize transport, mobilize resources in good time, establish contingency stocks, and thus be in a position to cope with the unexpected. The staff involved in a nutritional assessment plays a central role in facilitating such efforts, by informing logistics staff of survey developments as early as possible. # Purchasing and hiring goods and services\nLogistical services must purchase and hire goods and services, and this demands professional expertise. Standard procedures exist, especially for foodstuffs:\n2.9 Resource mobilization 2."
