"the dwelling, multiplied by one hundred to provide a percentage. A more common example is the ratio between infection arising during a given period and the overall population that is exposed to that risk. Monitoring the incidence rate at regular intervals provides invaluable information as to the evolution of the situation. Incidence rates are rarely available at the stage of preliminary appraisal; they can, however, be obtained through monitoring: number of new cases during a given period incidence rate = - -----------------------------------\u00d7 \n\n# overall number of individuals at risk\nIncidence rates enable the calculation of relative risk, which is the risk faced by subjects who are exposed to a phenomenon (or risk factor) as compared to subjects who are not."
