"(or risk factor) as compared to subjects who are not. Relative risk is expressed as follows:\nincidence rate among exposed subjects relative risk = - --------------------------------------\u00d7 \n\n# Prevalence\nThe prevalence rate is the number of cases at a given moment as a proportion of a specifi c group at risk. For example, the prevalence rate of malnutrition among children between 1 and 5 years is the ratio between the number of malnourished children between 1 and 5 and the overall number of children between 1 and 5, multiplied by one hundred to provide a percentage. The same reasoning may be applied to the prevalence of a given opinion: in this case, the ratio between the number of individuals that hold the opinion and the overall population, multiplied by one hundred (this is frequently done in election polls, for instance):\nnumber of cases at a given moment prevalence rate = - ---------------------------------\u00d7 \n\n# overall number of individuals at risk\nPrevalence rates refl ect the magnitude of an event at a given moment in time."
