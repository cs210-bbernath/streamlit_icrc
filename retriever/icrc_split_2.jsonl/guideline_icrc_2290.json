"-distribution cards are always a source of problems and abuse. This practice applies both to centres distributing meals to be eaten on the spot and those providing take-away rations. Bracelets indicate the benefi ciary's number, the identifi cation code of the registration centre, and the code or logo of the agency in charge. This information in itself limits abuse. \n# Human resources\nThe centre must be staffed with suffi cient resources, properly paid, aware of their role and responsibilities, and trained to perform their tasks. Each task within the centre must be assigned to a person in charge: caretaking, cleaning, cooking, verifi cation, etc."
