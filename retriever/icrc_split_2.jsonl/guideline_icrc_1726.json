"Moreover, mineral and vitamin intakes must permit the resumption of metabolic functions: this implies in particular that the Type II nutrient balance must be observed. The above has led Briend and Golden to recommend the use of F-75 Formula, as detailed in Table 13.5 below (Briend & Golden, 1997); this diet is adapted to the initial treatment of severely malnourished individuals that present both kwashiorkor and marasmus. Briend and Golden have also devised the F-100 Formula, used during rehabilitation, which contains higher energy and protein concentrations, with the same micro-nutrient content. F-75 Formula supplies roughly 75 kcal (313 kJ) per 100 ml (hence its name), with a protein-energy ratio 24 (P/E ratio) of approximately 5%, and a lipid-energy ratio of approximately 35%. Opinions differ as to the use of F-75 Formula during initial treatment because its energy concentration is low, it introduces a new product and additional complications for kitchen staff to handle, while the use of more concentrated solutions has yielded equally good results. However, in severely wasted patients and those suffering from kwashiorkor, F-75 Formula is without question most appropriate and avoids, in particular, protein overload. F-75 and F-100 Formulae were initially developed and commercialized by Nutriset, a French company, and are both widely used by humanitarian agencies; \"Nutriset milk\" has in fact become a common expression in the nutritional jargon. If F-75 Formula is unavailable, traditional recipes involving the use of powdered milk, oil, and sugar 25 may be resorted to. The powdered milk, sugar and oil must be well blended in a \"pre-mix\" that can be stored for several days in clean and sealed containers."
