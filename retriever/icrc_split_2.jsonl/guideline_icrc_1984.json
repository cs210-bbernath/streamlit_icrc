"In case these are not available, they should be measured like children from 1 to 5 years old. Children are placed, preferably naked, 23 in a special sling that is attached to a Salter-type spring balance, itself solidly fastened to a tripod or another adequate support. The child must hang freely and must not be able to grab anything until the needle stabilizes -this is not always easily done."
