"for example, 10 clusters amount to 49.2 subjects per cluster. The number of subjects per cluster must then be rounded up, preferably upwards to increase accuracy, in this case 50. However, it is also possible to take 20 clusters of 25 subjects each: this still totals 500 subjects. The question therefore is whether it is best to have many clusters, and fewer subjects per cluster, or few clusters and more subjects in each. The purpose of cluster sampling is to minimize the effect of assumed heterogeneity in the area, because it is not possible or desirable to target more precisely."
