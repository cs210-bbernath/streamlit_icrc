"bacteria multiply dramatically and, if consumed, can cause serious diarrhoea. Since disaster victims will almost certainly not have access to refrigeration and, since they will be loath to dispose of a half-consumed tin of evaporated or condensed milk or the remains of an undrunk cup of reconstituted milk powder, these are likely to become real health hazards. \n# Dilution\nChildren whose main source of food is over-diluted milk powder will inevitably become malnourished. Children who are constantly fed under-diluted milk powder can become dangerously ill as a result of the high concentration of salt. When powdered milks are distributed from large sacks it is unlikely that the recipients receive proper guidance on dilution."
