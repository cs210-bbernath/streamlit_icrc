"the phenomenon, and in the second case, as the disaster. This is a way of analyzing the different stages in the evolution of a disaster situation and of identifying all the factors that cause it. The ultimate consequence is the loss of human lives. An aggressive phenomenon is always on the lookout for vulnerability in order to create problems; the latter themselves become aggressive phenomena in turn, looking for other kinds of vulnerability. This chain reaction eventually ends in the loss of human lives. This chain can be shown more generally as a spiral (see chart). \n# Possible Responses\nThe responses possible in a disaster situation can be classified in terms of the formula discussed earlier:  \n\n# Responses to the Initial Phenomenon\nEarthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and climatic disturbances (rain, cyclones) cannot be prevented, though cyclones and rain can be predicted, as can earthquakes (with considerably less accuracy, however)."
