"These factors interact at several levels and may create a real chain reaction. Thus, latent malnutrition (individual vulnerability) and agricultural underdevelopment (economic vulnerability) combine to create a nutritional disaster (exercising its impact on the groups that are already malnourished) in the wake of a drought (phenomenon). The drought itself may be considered as the result (impact on agricultural regions) of a phenomenon (drop in rainfall) in areas already ecologically devastated by erosion, deforestation, the absence of irrigation works, etc. (economic vulnerability)."
