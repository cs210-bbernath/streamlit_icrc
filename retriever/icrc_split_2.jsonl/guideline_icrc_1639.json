The staples that contribute to the ration are therefore usually the following:\n9 a main source of energy, usually cereals which also supplies a substantial amount of protein and micro-nutrients; 9 a concentrated source of protein, usually legumes, which provides both energy and micro-nutrients; 9 a concentrated source of energy in the form of vegetable oil or fat. These three types of foods must be balanced, with an acceptable variation in the order of \u00b15% that is usually determined by logistical constraints at distribution level."
