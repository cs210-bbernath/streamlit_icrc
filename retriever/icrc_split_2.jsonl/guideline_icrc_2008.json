"provides the data required to appraise the centre's effi ciency. \n# Monitoring benefi ciary status and progress\nThe nutritional status of benefi ciaries is measured at regular intervals (usually once a week), often on a rotating basis or during distribution in the case of take-away rations. Benefi ciaries and accompanying relatives must be informed of the date set for the check-up, and of the fact that the procedure takes time. In principle, an SFP targeting the moderately malnourished should lead to nutritional recovery, but -unlike therapeutic feeding centres -the feeding of benefi ciaries is not entirely controlled, thus complicating the issuing of recommendations as to weight gain."
