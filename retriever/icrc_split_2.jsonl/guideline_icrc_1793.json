"These programmes were implemented in line with theories prevailing at the time (de Ville de Goyet, 1978). For a given population, general food distributions to households were intended to provide a basic daily ration amounting to 1,500 kcal (6,270 kJ) per person for an initial period of a few weeks until the logistics base was properly set up. It was to be increased thereafter to 1,800 kcal (7,525 kJ) per person, per day for a longer duration. The belief at the time was that it was impossible to supply rations covering the recommended daily intake (on average, 2,350 kcal (9,820 kJ) per person), 7 and that it was not always opportune to do so, out of consideration for those who did not have access to the GFD and had to make do with lesser food resources. 8 It was nonetheless necessary to compensate for inadequacy in the basic ration by resorting to food supplements for those most vulnerable to malnutrition: children under 5 years of age, pregnant and breastfeeding women, the sick, the elderly, and moderately malnourished children. Supplements were calculated to supply approximately 350 kcal (1,500 kJ) and 15 grammes of protein per person, per day. In practice, a rift resulted between agencies using (frequently insuffi cient) GFDs and those preferring SFPs."
