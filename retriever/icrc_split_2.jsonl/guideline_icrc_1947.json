"7. National Societies, proposing to provide food other than that requested must seek the clearance of the ICRC/League. The Red Cross nutrition policy will otherwise be jeopardized, the consistent approach disrupted and confusion created. As outlined in Rule 24 of Principles and Rules for Red Cross Disaster Relief unsolicited food donations may be used at the discretion of the operating National Society. They may be sold and the cash paid to the relief operation account and used for a more benefi cial purpose for the affected population."
