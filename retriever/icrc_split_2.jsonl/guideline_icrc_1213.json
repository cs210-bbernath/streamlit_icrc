"Reality appears as assessment progresses, by corroboration, convergence and consistency of the information obtained, by combining indicators and the different sources of information pertaining to each indicator. Until data is corroborated, contradiction and divergence must be investigated by reviewing the initial hypotheses, by reformulating questions, by consulting stakeholders as to these contradictions and divergences, and by seeking to identify misunderstandings related to perception and language. Triangulation is clearly optimized by resorting to multidisciplinary assessment teams. The triangulation concept is illustrated in Figure 10.4 below. # Figure 10.4\nThe triangulation concept -appraising a situation via triangulation \n\n# Flexibility\nThis concept implies the constant adjustment of assessment as it progresses and as the understanding of reality becomes more accurate, according to developments, new avenues to be explored, and changes in direction or method. Flexibility is not an excuse for chaos or scattering."
