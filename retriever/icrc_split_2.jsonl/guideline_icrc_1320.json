"and the probable evolution of its economic behaviour and performance. Problems, as defi ned here, arise when the population has exhausted its specifi c reserves, that is, when it no longer has any other option but to resort to its survival reserves (see Figure 6.14). This option is dangerous, because it undermines the economic production capacity and the functional capacity of the organism. In practical terms, \"normality\" must be defi ned in consultation with the affected population in order to investigate possible gaps. It may then be compared with the situation at hand. The resources used for survival indicate which level of the famine process has been reached."
