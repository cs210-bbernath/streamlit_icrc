"Setting rations children who can quickly become malnourished and anorexic. Ingredients that enhance fl avour can also, in part, be those that supply micro-nutrients (such as biscuits). Depending on local eating habits, they may also include spices that season staple foods, sugar, tea, or coffee. Much social interaction occurs around a cup of coffee or tea, and most of it aims to preserve or restore the economic system. In this framework therefore, ration diversity reaches beyond strictly nutritional objectives, and allows for the social dimension of food. In fact, people always seek to obtain the spices and foodstuffs that are socially and culturally necessary."
