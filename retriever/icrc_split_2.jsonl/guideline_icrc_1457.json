"As a result, vitamin A complements should be included in any GFD, and their inclusion is compulsory if defi ciency is suspected. This consists in supplying vitamin A enriched foods (i.e. oil containing approximately 6,000 IU of retinol/100 g, or cereal blends containing approximately 1,700 IU of retinol/100 g) in order to ensure a basic intake. Because signifi cant vitamin A losses occur during cooking and because oil rations are frequently sold off, preventive measures must be taken from the outset, such as the distribution of vitamin A capsules to all children under the age of 10. 19 The advantage of vitamin A relates to the fact that it is stored in the liver in rather large amounts. The posology is 200,000 IU (110 mg of retinol palmitate or 66 mg of retinol acetate) per dose, administered orally, for all ages above 1 year; half that amount, that is, 100,000 IU (55 mg of retinol palmitate or 33 mg of retinol acetate) per dose, administered orally, is recommended for infants between 0 and 12 months. Preventive treatment should be avoided during pregnancy, and instead a single 200,000 IU dose should be administered straight after delivery. Vitamin A capsules are usually found in 100,000 IU and 200,000 IU doses. If no 100,000 IU capsules are available for small infants, a 200,000 IU capsule may be punctured, and three drops extracted from it for oral administration. The above dosage protects against defi ciency during approximately 6 months; as a result, vitamin A capsules should be distributed every 4 to 6 months at least. Moreover, the distribution of vitamin A enriched foods (oil or cereal blends) extends vitamin A protection to individuals that are not included in prevention measures involving the administration of capsules (especially women of childbearing age, for which high preventive doses may be teratogenic). 20 Vitamin C Vitamin C poses the greatest challenge as it is only found in fresh (and thus perishable) products, or in enriched foods that risk considerable loss through oxidation during storage and cooking. Consequently, apart from the distribution of tablets as discussed earlier, vitamin C can only be supplied in the form of specifi cally fortifi ed foods or biscuits. This method is however only effective 3."
