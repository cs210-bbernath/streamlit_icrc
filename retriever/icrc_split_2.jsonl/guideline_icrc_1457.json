This is the case, for example, in anthropometry, especially in using mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) or MUAC-for-height, which are faster to measure than weight and height. If almost all the subjects in a village or neighbourhood can be gathered in a central location, it is usually possible to measure them all in a matter of hours; sampling on the other hand involves counting houses or people and verifying lists fi rst, not to mention the work involved in selecting samples and sampling methods."
