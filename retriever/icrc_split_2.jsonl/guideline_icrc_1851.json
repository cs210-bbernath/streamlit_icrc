"Clearly, the same cleanliness standards apply to cutlery. Domestic garbage and waste water should be removed from the kitchen as quickly as possible, to distant locations intended for this use, and which inhibit vector proliferation (fl ies and mosquitoes). Leftovers can be recycled as compost or fed to animals, but the latter must not be admitted to the kitchens. # Personal hygiene\nIn terms of personal hygiene, hands must be washed with water and soap, and dried with an immaculate towel or else air-dried. A soiled soap or towel can easily turn into a culture medium. Soap should be rinsed and drained after each use. Hands should be washed before handling food or sitting down at the meal table, following each interruption of kitchen chores -especially in order to visit sanitary facilities or change diapers, and between chores (for example, after handling raw meat and before dealing with the vegetables). Fingernails are best kept short. Wounds should be dressed, especially in case of infection, and dressings should be changed often enough to keep their outside clean. Hand cleanliness is only the last indication of personal hygiene: clean hair and clothing, and the use of a handkerchief to blow one's nose or cough into are other means of limiting food contamination. # Water used for food preparation and washing\nThe water used for the preparation and washing of food is usually the same as drinking water, and is a common source of contamination and infection. In case of doubt, it should be boiled for at least 10 minutes."
