"total population, 40-50 per 1,000 will need to be hospitalized. 42 Thus, for a population of 50,000 refugees, the relief team should reckon on 2,500 patients being hospitalized per year. If an average hospital stay is figured at seven days, this works out to 18,000 days of hospitalization. Accordingly, provision must be made for a hospitalization capacity of 50 beds. 43 All these figures should be considered as very vague estimates which merely give an idea of the number of patients that can be expected in this type of situation. It is useful to know that for 50,000 people, a hospital with a maximum of 50-100 beds is needed, rather than a hospital with 500 beds."
