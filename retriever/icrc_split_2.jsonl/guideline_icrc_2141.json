"if necessary. Annex III : Recommendations to inter-governmental organizations 1. IGOs should recognize NGHAs, local and foreign, as valuable partners: NGHAs are willing to work with UN and other inter-governmental agencies to effect better disaster response. They do so in a spirit of partnership which respects the integrity and independence of all partners. Inter-governmental agencies must respect the independence and impartiality of the NGHAs.\nNGHAs should be consulted by UN agencies in the preparation of relief plans. 2. IGOs should assist host governments in providing an overall coordinating framework for international and local disaster relief: NGHAs do not usually have the mandate to provide the overall coordinating framework for disasters which require an international response."
