"Such programs respond to a vital need, such as the immediate immunization of all vulnerable subjects against measles, the provision of drinking water to a population as quickly as possible, or the treatment of malnourished people to keep them alive. However, if such programs are not part of an integrated system, they may miss their mark. A nutrition rehabilitation program does not solve the problem of malnutrition, if households do not have access to food resources. Similarly, the establishment of a water-supply system goes hand in hand with waste removal, since otherwise the waste is liable to contaminate the water sources."
