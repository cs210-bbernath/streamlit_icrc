"If it is not, the whole problem arises of aiding not only the victims of a disaster, but also neighboring populations not directly affected by it. & Financial resources usually correspond to the human resources. Certainly, the measures that have to be taken and, especially, the speed of the intervention impose a high cost. The relief team must know how to manage resources according to the victims' needs rather than the available funds. These factors have a considerable impact on the ''consumption'' of medical services. Of course, the relation between the magnitude of real needs and the provision of appropriate medical services is clear -at least at the beginning of an intervention, when the preventive measures instituted together with the medical intervention have not yet had a measurable impact on the victims' health status. However, even if needs decline after a few weeks, the victims' demand for medical care is not necessarily less. Physical access, free treatment, and the attraction of medical services that in many cases are based on Western standards are all factors favoring the consumption of medical services. Under these conditions, it is difficult to quantify with any precision the resources that must be mobilized to satisfy the medical needs of a population in an emergency situation. # Estimation of Necessary Resources\n\n# Ambulatory Care\nAverage figures generated in normal times indicate that every individual comes into contact with the medical services twice a year. 38 A distinction should be made between preventive-care contacts (immunization, health education, etc.) and primary or secondary consultations. 39 The number of medical consultations (at the dispensary level) can be empirically estimated at four to six consultations (primary and secondary) per year and per person in a refugee camp, at least during the first three months of the relief operation. This figure should normally fall to two or three per year and per person. 40 This workload may be distributed differently depending on the degree to which ambulatory care (provided by CHW health stations, dispensaries, or local clinics) is decentralized. A study on refugee camps by the health ministry of Honduras showed that the average number of consultations per person and per year was 1.7 for refugees of Nicaraguan origin, 4.3 for refugees of Mosquito origin, and 3.9 for refugees of Salvadorian origin. The distribution of this workload between the community health workers and the health-care professionals (doctors and nurses) was respectively 18% for CHWs-Nicaragua, 51% for CHWs-Mosquito, and 53% for CHWs-Salvador."
