"injuries The lesions caused by a given agent may vary. For example, in bullet wounds, the extent of the lesion depends on the weight of the projectile, its stability, 46 the soundness of its construction, 47 its shape, and its velocity. 48 All these factors may combine to create particularly large lesions, due to the high transfer of energy. 49 Cavitation is produced, drawing debris and germs into the wound and causing additional lesions at some distance from the wound itself. \n\n# trunk\n\n# lower limbs\nAnti-personnel mine explosions cause localized injuries at foot and leg level; the location of bullet wounds is much more variable."
