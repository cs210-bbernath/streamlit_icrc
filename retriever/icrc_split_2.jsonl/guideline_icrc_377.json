"individuals and the impact on the population as a whole. \n# Impact on the Individual\nIt is known that diseases such as poliomyelitis, measles, and tuberculosis can cause infirmity, death, or incapacity. To the individual, each of them poses a major risk. \n# Impact on the Population\nIn emergency situations and in most developing countries, the concept of a disease's impact on the population is very important. In normal situations, the aim is to manage limited resources optimally, addressing the problems that have the most impact on the population as a whole. In an emergency situation, resource availability is still something to consider."
