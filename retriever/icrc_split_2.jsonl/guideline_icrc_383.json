"the steps which, together, would control the communicable diseases effectively. The integrated, multidisciplinary approaches that can be instituted in an emergency, given the factors just mentioned, will be examined through the following examples:\n& malaria & measles & diarrheal diseases (cholera) & tuberculosis & meningococcal meningitis & intestinal parasitic infestation\nThese diseases do not necessarily constitute priorities as defined earlier, but as examples they serve as ''puzzles'' in which the different pieces vary in importance according to the disease. The intervention strategies for measles and poliomyelitis are fairly similar, in that they are based on the systematic immunization of groups at risk."
