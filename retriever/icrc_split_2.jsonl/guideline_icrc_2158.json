"# a) Food in unmilled form especially cereals is preferable. Food in umilled form usually has longer shelf life, higher nutritional value, more identifi able taste and lower cost. Whole grain must be milled to release full food value. Some traditional methods retain more nutrients and should therefore be encouraged and supported. Protein requirements should preferably be supplied by cereals, beans, peas and lentils. Due to lack of understanding with regard to quality and amount of protein contents of some vegetables, especially those mentioned, requests are often made for expensive fi sh or meat products. Local fi sh or meat may be a preferred option when available, but imported varieties should be avoided."
