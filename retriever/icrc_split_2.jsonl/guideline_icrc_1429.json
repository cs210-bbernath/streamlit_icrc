"It goes without saying that rations should not be automatically increased in harsh climatic conditions: habitat material must be supplied fi rst in order to protect their recipients against the cold (shelter against rain or snow and wind, heating material, etc.), and clothing and blankets for thermal comfort. Such measures against the cold are usually taken once only (one-off supplies), whereas adjustments to food rations must then be adhered to permanently, involving a signifi cant increase in the overall cost of the operation. That being said, increasing rations is sometimes justifi ed, and the decision must involve nutritionist input. It is worth noting here that, if the organism cannot maintain its normal temperature, the resulting hypothermia is usually fatal below 25\u00b0C. The chilling of a malnourished individual, poorly clad and exposed to the elements (as is often the case in disaster), is extremely rapid. In famines, malnutrition becomes generalized and extreme, and mortality among the homeless peaks at night-time and in rainy conditions. Clearly, humanitarian ethics demand that acceptable habitat and thermal comfort conditions be ensured whenever feasible. If these conditions are satisfactory, rations must nevertheless be adapted to the ambient temperature, in compliance with the recommendations issued by the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Offi ce of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Both agencies have set an individual daily basic ration for an average ambient temperature of 20\u00b0C, and propose to increase it by 100 kcal (418 kJ) for each 5\u00b0C below that threshold (WFP, 1997). Light\n\n# Calorie content\nThe above parameters being set, the calorie content of food rations must be defi ned in order to satisfy all the energy requirements of the target population. In terms of temperature, specifi c recommendations exist, provided that the necessary complementary measures relating to habitat and thermal comfort are taken."
