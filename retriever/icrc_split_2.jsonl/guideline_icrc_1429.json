"the number of subject to select in each chosen cluster. Subjects may then be randomly selected within these clusters, or selected systematically according to the interval approach; alternatively, all the subjects that lie within a given direction are selected (this is the systematic approach to cluster sampling, see below). \n# Systematic method\nA more sophisticated approach, similar to systematic sampling, consists in dividing up a given geographical area into sections, which are not strictly clusters, and obtaining for each section an acceptable estimation of the total number of subjects. The resulting data is then refl ected in a fi vecolumn table as follows:\n9 column 1 indicates the section names or numbers; 9 column 2 indicates the estimated overall population within the section; 9 column 3 indicates the aggregate population (i.e. the population of previous sections added to that of the current section); 9 column 4 indicates the overall numbers corresponding to each section; 9 column 5 indicates the number of clusters in each section."
