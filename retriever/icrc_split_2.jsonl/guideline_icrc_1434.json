"9 In the early 1980s, the ICRC chose to round the WHO 1 ration (i.e. 2,350 kcal, or 9,820 kJ) up to 2,400 kcal (10,030 kJ) as its reference; this permits the coverage of the energy requirements in moderately active populations according to the recommendations issued by the WHO in force at the time (de Ville de Goyet, 1978). The large United Nations agencies have chosen a ration that may seem limited; it nevertheless represents a 10% increase of the previously applied standard of 1,900 kcal (7,940 kJ). This standard had in fact been imposed in 1988 by Seaman and Rivers, at the end of the \"Nutrition in Time of Disaster\" conference (USAID, 1989), when some participants held the view that this recommendation remained excessive in spite of the nutritional disasters that had resulted from the delivery of lower rations. The 1,900 kcal standard is the absolute minimum for populations whose demographic profi le is that of a developing country, whose energy expenditure hardly reaches maintenance (that is, inferior to that required for light physical activity), whose nutritional status verges on moderate malnutrition, and that live in a hot climate. Seaman and Rivers deserve credit for having imposed, for the fi rst time, a decision based on physiological criteria, and which enables the calculation of supplements for all relevant situations."
