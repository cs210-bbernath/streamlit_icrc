"the third is the selection of subjects within the clusters. Cluster random sampling is illustrated in Figures 10.8 and 10.9 below. The example of systematic cluster random sampling provided in Figure 10.9 refl ects the division of the area into 8 sub-sections. The interval size used to attribute clusters to sub-sections is 500, and the fi rst subject selected randomly is 450. \n# Stratifi ed random sampling\nStratifi ed random sampling consists in defi ning, within a given area, groups (based on sex, age, professional activity, number of children per family, etc.) that are known to share specifi c features with respect to the variable under scrutiny."
