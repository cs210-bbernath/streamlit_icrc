"All MHUs draw up detailed plans to ensure a regular presence in the field. MHUs are described as being very useful for screening campaigns (breast cancer,  uterine cancer,  tuberculosis,  schistosomiasis, 29,30 etc.) and, more broadly, for health promotion and preventive activities. The MHUs with the highest rate of efficiency are those treating certain pathologies during a single visit (cataract,  dental problems 38 ). MHUs must focus on serious pathologies which are slow to develop, such as leishmaniasis, onchocercosis, leprosy and trypanosomiasis, but also on screening for breast or cervical cancer and on dental care. 39 MHUs are often run by charities and rarely seek to adopt a public health approach. The high cost of MHUs is stressed in many articles,  while few report on their impact, except for those working in the areas of dentistry  or eye care. 58,59 Many MHUs are set up to reduce the number of hospitalizations and thus related costs. Articles on MHUs which are part of a PHC programme emphasize the importance of community involvement (organization of the site of consultations, schedule of visits, mobilization, etc.). To encourage attendance at MHUs, the first services offered are those of greatest interest to the population (vaccination as part of a family planning programme, 67 distribution of condoms in clinics dealing with sexually transmitted diseases or AIDS). 68,69 \n\n# | KEY MESSAGES FROM A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE 6\nThe factors listed below are based on experiences in the field and those reported in the literature. # MHUs are a strategy to be used as a last resort to allow population groups which are cut off from health services easier access to the health system\nIn view of the intermittent nature of the services provided by an MHU, any other strategy for providing health services is to be preferred. # MHUs require highly trained human resources\nThe implications of triage, the limited range of services available, continuous analysis of problems, use of the intrinsic flexibility of MHUs, and the need to ensure that the operation is consistent with the ICRC's objectives outside the area of health mean that staff working in MHUs must adhere to a strict and rational public health approach. # MHUs are a favoured strategy for vertical programmes\nA programme is described as vertical when the health personnel involved are brought in from another facility (usually one on a higher level in the health hierarchy) to dispense specific treatment. For example, a health centre may receive specialists in leishmaniasis or malaria, or a hospital may receive an ophthalmological surgeon."
