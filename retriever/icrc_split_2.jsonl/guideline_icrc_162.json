"whether the distribution program is indeed achieving the desired result. The tool of surveillance is studied in detail in Chapter 6 (''Epidemiology''). Nonetheless, emphasis should be placed on the indicators that must be monitored, particularly:\n-nutritional status -intra-familial distribution of food aid -market prices -population movements. This sort of surveillance also provides the information necessary in order to decide when food distribution can be stopped. 63 Monitoring is necessary not only at the moment of distribution, but also afterwards, to make sure, first, that the beneficiaries are not robbed of their food rations, and second, that the goods received are not systematically resold on the local market by the beneficiaries themselves."
