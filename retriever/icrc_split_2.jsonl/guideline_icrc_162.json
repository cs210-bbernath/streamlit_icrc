"# VI. Nutritional Rehabilitation\nThe purpose of nutrition rehabilitation programs is to restore a normal nutritional status. The tendency is to restrict such programs to intensive feeding regimens for the most severe cases of malnutrition. In this course, however, all the possible ways of responding to the specific needs of the malnourished will be noted. # Nutritional Deficiencies\nThe expression ''nutritional deficiencies'' encompasses various aspects of the nutritional problems that may arise in emergency situations. They can be classified by type, the major category being protein-energy malnutrition. This, in turn, encompasses two main groups:\ngrowth retardation (stunting) Stunting reflects an adaptation to environmental stresses such as moderate lack of food and various infections. Children whose growth has been stunted in this manner are of below-normal height. 70 acute malnutrition (wasting) Such malnutrition may be either moderate or severe, depending on the degree of wasting. The moderate forms are characterized by a perceptibly lower body weight than the norm for the person's height. The severe forms can be subdivided into three categories: -Marasmus -characterized by a substantial loss of fat and muscle mass -Kwashiorkor -characterized by the presence of edema -Marasmic kwashiorkor -a combination of the two. The main vitamin and mineral deficiencies include anemia and deficiencies in vitamins A, C, and B 1 . # Nutrition Rehabilitation Programs (NRPs)\n\n# General Principles\nThe first principle of nutritional rehabilitation is that the families involved must be guaranteed access to food. NRPs are established in emergency situations in 70 ''The curve of a child's height is an excellent photograph of the child's previous life, revealing the growth history to date, since a nutritional problem affects the length of the child's body only after a delay of two or three months."
