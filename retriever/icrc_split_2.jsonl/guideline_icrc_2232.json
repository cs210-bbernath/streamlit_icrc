"the climate and that their volume ensure satisfactory working conditions. Equipment may equally vary. In fact, a TFC can be set up with quite basic means, without altering the quality of its attention. A common mistake is to wait for all the material and infrastructure to meet arbitrary standards, when a TFC could be improvised at once with locally available means, and be improved as more substantial and advanced means become available. TFC must be planned according to its projected activities, as follows:\n9 admitting and attending to benefi ciaries and their carers; 9 accommodating benefi ciaries and their carers; 9 treating the benefi ciaries; 9 feeding benefi ciaries and possibly their carers; 9 monitoring the programme and its benefi ciaries; 9 managing and maintaining the TFC; 9 providing recreation, training, and occupation to benefi ciaries and their carers."
