"cause epidemics, but no vaccine is available for serogroup B. 109 Immunization is relatively ineffective in children under age two (group C); group A requires two injections to produce a satisfactory rate of seroconversion. What is more, the immunity thus acquired is of limited duration. Immunization of children under the age of one year is not recommended. 110 -Epidemics of the disease are naturally self-limiting, so that to be effective an immunization campaign must be implemented quickly (as soon as the first cases are diagnosed). From these two observations it can be concluded, first, that routine immunization in the framework of an EPI, in the absence of any epidemic, is not recommended, due to the limited duration of immunity; and, second, that in an epidemic, immunization must be carried out immediately or not at all -hence the importance of a surveillance system able to spot the beginnings of contagion quickly."
