"2.576 and, consequently, the sample size \"n\" rises to 425. Similarly, if accuracy is increased to \u00b1 3%, for a 5% sampling error, the sample size rises to 683. Finally, if the prevalence rate cannot be estimated and is therefore arbitrarily set at 50% to minimize the risk of inaccuracy, the sample size for a 5% sampling error and a \u00b1 5% accuracy is 384. Generally speaking, the lower the sampling error, the smaller the confi dence interval and the closer the expected prevalence lies to 50%, the larger the sample is. Usually, the expected prevalence rate and the sampling error cannot be adjusted in order to reduce sample size; however the intended accuracy can be reduced, provided that this still produces results that are relevant to operations, that is, that permit decision-making."
