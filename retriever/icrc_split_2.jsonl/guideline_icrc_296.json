"2 The risk factors, listed below, are numerous, and the way they interact varies from case to case, so that they must be identified in every instance before the appropriate means of intervention can be determined. # Presence of a New Pathogenic Agent\nPopulation migration may introduce new pathogenic agents into the host region. Usually it is not a new pathogenic agent in the strict sense, but rather a different strain from the one normally found in that particular environment. Thus, for example, the appearance along the border between Thailand and Cambodia of colonies of Plasmodium falciparum resistant to the major antimalarial drugs has been attributed in part to the intermixing of populations in that area. The primary victims of this phenomenon are the displaced people themselves (although they may have a certain degree of immunity), but the local population may also be affected, being usually much more sensitive to a new pathogenic agent."
