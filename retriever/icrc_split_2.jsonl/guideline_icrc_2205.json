"is 22%, they are called \"very low-fat diets\" (Shils, 1994). \n# The protein/energy ratio\nIn the discussion on nutritional needs, Chapter III demonstrated that diets that supply enough energy usually supply enough protein also. This is noted especially in the case of food rations that combine cereals and legumes. The proportion between protein and energy is expressed as a percentage of the energy value 11 of the protein and the overall energy supply: this is the \"P/E%\" ratio below. \n# G \u00d7 Kp P/E% = --------------\u00d7 100 Kr\nWhere: G = the protein weight in the ration K = the calorie value Kp = the calorie value of the protein contained in the ration (kcal/gram, or kJ/gram) Kr = the overall calorie value of the ration (kcal or kJ)\nFor example, a ration that supplies 2,400 kcal (10,032 kJ) in total, with 70 g of protein, translates into the following P/E% ratio: --------------------\u00d7 100 = 11.7 % 2,400 kcal A P/E% ratio of 10 to 13% is usually adequate to satisfy protein requirements, provided that energy requirements are met."
