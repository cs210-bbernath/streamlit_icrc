"It would otherwise only be a desperate move and resolve nothing. # Criteria for discharge\nFor individuals to be discharged, their medical treatment must have been completed, and their nutritional status must have remained stable during the past fortnight and be equal or superior to the following thresholds:\n9 mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC): 13.5 cm; 9 MUAC-for-height expressed as a percentage of the median: 80%; 9 MUAC-for-height expressed in Z-scores: -2 Z-scores; 9 weight-for-height expressed as a percentage of the median: 80%; 9 weight-for-height expressed in Z-scores: -2 Z-scores. As long as the GFD is not adequate, discharge criteria may however not -or very slowly -be met; this is an indication that practically all moderately malnourished individuals must be included in the SFP for the programme to succeed. # SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING PROGRAMME CENTRES\nSupplementary feeding programmes (SFP) translate into practice in centres which can moreover be linked to therapeutic feeding centres and health centres, unless they provide healthcare themselves. Two types of SFP centres exist, where the ration is to be either eaten on the spot or taken home. It is tempting to prefer take-away rations owing to their following advantages:\n9 their organization is simpler; 9 they demand less resources; 9 more benefi ciaries can be assisted; 9 accompanying relatives waste far less time; 9 the risk of benefi ciaries transmitting infectious diseases is lower; 9 access to them is easier for scattered populations. Take-away distributions nevertheless have disadvantages if there is a danger of attack, or if the household lacks the required wherewithal (fuel, cooking utensils). In spite of the advantages of take-away rations, distributing rations to be eaten daily on the spot is preferable when targeting moderately malnourished individuals. It facilitates the monitoring of highly health-vulnerable benefi ciaries, who can rapidly fall prey to negative side effects which can only be mitigated through strict control. 15 On the other hand, when an SFP targets a group rather than malnutrition specifi cally, it probably makes more sense to distribute take-away rations. # Activities in an SFP centre\nIn centres where food rations are eaten on a daily basis, the range of activities is wider than in a centre supplying take-away rations, where it consists of the registration and discharge of benefi ciaries, monitoring their nutritional and health status, and the distribution of food. Activities pertaining to both set-ups are nevertheless discussed here together, for simplicity's sake. # Registration and admission of benefi ciaries\nThese aspects are virtually identical to those of a therapeutic feeding centre's (TFC). Characteristics specifi c to SFPs are indicated below; the remaining are discussed in Chapter XIII, Section 3.3.1. # Identifi cation through bracelets\nIn SFP centres, the use of bracelets not only facilitates identifi cation, it also avoids the use of distribution cards to accompanying relatives or the benefi ciary himself -distribution cards are always a source of problems and abuse. This practice applies both to centres distributing meals to be eaten on the spot and those providing take-away rations. Bracelets indicate the benefi ciary's number, the identifi cation code of the registration centre, and the code or logo of the agency in charge."
