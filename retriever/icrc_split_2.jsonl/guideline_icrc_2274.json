"leftovers must never be served again at the following meal. \n# Serving meals\nDuring the fi rst week, children should continue to consume 8 meals daily at 3 hour intervals, especially those who show complications in the course of treatment. Practically speaking, if intake is set at 200 kcal (840 kJ)/kg/day with F-100 Formula, then 8 rations of 25 ml each of F-100 Formula/kg/day must be supplied. Circumstances may prevent this, especially in case of night-time security problems or curfews, and if the TFC cannot include a camp for the permanent accommodation of carers. Therefore, feeding should begin as early as possible in the morning and end as late as possible at night."
