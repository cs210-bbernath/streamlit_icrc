In emergencies, plastic sheeting distributed for the construction of shelters can also be used to collect rain water. Technological input is very minor. \n# Surface Water\nAs noted previously, surface water must be considered as contaminated. Certain methods of exploiting it, can be used, however, to obviate the necessity of treating it. Such methods include, for example, sinking wells in the banks of a river, or -geographical -social -financial (i.e., whether payment is required) -safe access in conflict zones burying a filter box in the river bed."
