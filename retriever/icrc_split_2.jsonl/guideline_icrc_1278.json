"A set square is lowered fi rmly onto the crown of the head (particular care must be taken here in the case of thick hair), and height is recorded to the nearest millimetre (for example, 85.6 cm). # Arm circumference (AC)\nArm circumference, also called mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) or brachial circumference, is used to estimate lean mass and adipose tissue, being the two compartments of nutritional reserves. In this respect, it is therefore more accurate than weight. MUAC is measured on the left arm, which must hang relaxed or be held against the torso if the subject is struggling. The value is measured at the mid-point between the tip of the shoulder (acromium) and the tip of the elbow (olecranon). A common tape measure can be used, but it is safer to use a special graded (sometimes colour-coded) insertion strip that is adjusted in the reading window located at one end to read the measurement accurately at the \"0\" gradation mark. The strip must connect with the entire arm circumference, and this is done by applying fi nger pressure; it must not be too tight and cause skin bulges around it, nor leave space between it and the skin. It is best to slide it through the reading window without pulling the ends."
