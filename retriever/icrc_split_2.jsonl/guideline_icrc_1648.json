"(as is often the case in disaster), is extremely rapid. In famines, malnutrition becomes generalized and extreme, and mortality among the homeless peaks at night-time and in rainy conditions. Clearly, humanitarian ethics demand that acceptable habitat and thermal comfort conditions be ensured whenever feasible. If these conditions are satisfactory, rations must nevertheless be adapted to the ambient temperature, in compliance with the recommendations issued by the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Offi ce of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Both agencies have set an individual daily basic ration for an average ambient temperature of 20\u00b0C, and propose to increase it by 100 kcal (418 kJ) for each 5\u00b0C below that threshold (WFP, 1997)."
