"Together with its anti-infectious properties, this aspect makes it especially important for poor families and in times of crisis. # The use of cow's milk\nCow's milk should be boiled in order to destroy potentially pathogenic microbes and improve the digestibility of its protein; boiled water and sugar should then be added in the following proportions:\n9 125 ml of boiled milk; 9 75 ml of boiled water; 9 15 g of sugar. This procedure produces approximately 200 ml of milk preparation, supplying roughly 70 kcal (290 kJ) and 2 g of protein per 100 ml. # The use of dried whole milk\nIn order to achieve the same concentration as with the previous recipe using cow's milk, whole dried milk should be reconstituted with one weight unit of milk for 11 weight units of water (or one volume unit of milk for 5 volume units of water). The water should be previously boiled and allowed to cool off completely; sugar should be added."
