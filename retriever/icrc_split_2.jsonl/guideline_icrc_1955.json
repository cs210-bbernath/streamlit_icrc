"a TFC begin to smile, they are in principle saved. Severely malnourished children are also emotionally harmed, and malnutrition itself impairs mental development. This impairment is partly caused by the child's restricted interaction with its physical and social environment resulting from its apathy, irritability, and reduced mobility. Consequently, the treatment of severely malnourished children involves emotional stimulation: this includes showing them affection, organizing recreational activities (such as games, songs, dances, and stories), the use of traditional musical instruments, and ensuring proper supervision by staff that is specially assigned to these tasks. Such staff should preferably belong to the same cultural group as most of the children."
