"It may be diffi cult to secure a comprehensive set-up of qualifi ed staff from the outset; in such cases, training schemes must be designed, and individual progress must be tracked and documented. The TFC manager or deputy must monitor all TFC activities regularly and without exception. This is necessary in order to ensure that the operation is running properly and to show interest in the work of each individual staff member, which is also a strong motivation."
