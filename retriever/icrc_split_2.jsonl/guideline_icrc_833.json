"distinction should be made between relief organizations and health-care services. & Relief organizations: 33 In developing countries, local mutual-aid societies are organized to varying degrees, but they all depend on the country's economic resources, and the human resources to manage them. They lack the technological know-how required to deal with emergency situations, whether in the preparatory or implementational phases. & Health services:\nThe vulnerability of the health services can be analyzed at both the physical and organizational levels. On the physical level, these services may be vulnerable, for example, because of their proximity to disaster-prone areas, or because the facilities were not built to earthquake standards."
