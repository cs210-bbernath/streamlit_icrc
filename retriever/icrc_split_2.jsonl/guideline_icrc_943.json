"To do it, the framework of our analysis must be expanded to include protection needs and a comparison of the specific needs of all the groups of victims in a given situation. # The Comprehensiveness of Needs\nThe concept of ''vital needs'' is often limited to material needs, if not physiological needs pure and simple. This view tends to restrict humanitarian interventions to the provision of material aid, when often the victims' need of protection is even greater. In a situation where essential material needs are covered, the humanitarian agencies may be tempted to cover non-vital needs in order to maintain their presence and thereby provide a certain degree of protection to victims being subjected to repeated violations of their rights. Similarly, a non-urgent intervention to help a particular group sometimes permits access to another group of victims whose essential needs may not be covered. # Local Services\nAs mentioned in Chapter 9, international humanitarian law assigns the responsibility for meeting victims' needs to the national authorities. In practice, application of this principle can pose serious problems."
