"program, the two points of view can, nevertheless, be reconciled. On one hand, humanitarian organizations cannot take care of an entire region; on the other, local authorities may argue that their people suffer from the same problems, but have not had the ''luck'' to be affected by the conflict. It may be possible to:\n. direct aid to the displaced populations in such a way that there will be positive fallout for the resident population;\n. select groups at risk, not only to help them, but also (and especially) to show the local authorities that the needs of their own people are also being taken into account."
