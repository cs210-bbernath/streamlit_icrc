"Vulnerability The economic system is particularly vulnerable in developing countries. This vulnerability appears in many forms, which are intermixed with each other and with the other types of vulnerability. They can be distinguished as follows:\n\n# Individual and Family Economic Vulnerability\nDue to insufficient income, some rural populations are unable to survive a year of bad harvests. The absence of both food reserves and the financial means to buy the food they need makes them very vulnerable to climatic vagaries. In general, the mortality associated with disasters is inversely proportional to revenue. \n# Local Economic Vulnerability\nLocal economic vulnerability is a problem in geographical areas that are unfavorable to economic development."
