"# II. The Conceptual Framework of Disaster\nrisk of a natural or man-made phenomenon occurring (threat);\n. risk of a disaster occurring (meaning the impact of a phenomenon on a population, which depends on the latter's vulnerability to the phenomenon). # Phenomena\nThe phenomena that cause disasters may be classified by:\n. origin -geophysical (volcanoes, for example), technological (chemical accidents), or human (conflict);\n. speed of onset -abrupt (earthquake) or gradual (drought);\n. hierarchy 22 -two levels of disaster should be distinguished: primary events without human intervention (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, drought), and secondary events which are largely the consequence of the primary ones (floods, landslides, erosion). # Vulnerability\nVulnerability has been given many definitions:\n''A community's incapacity to absorb the effects of a given change in its environment.'' 23 ''Individuals and societies are vulnerable to disasters when they are in a weak position to handle the effects of a crisis. Three types of vulnerability may be distinguished: physical, organisational and psychological.'' 24 ''The concept of vulnerability has been widely used to denote a condition in which the physical and mental well-being required for a normal productive life is impaired and at constant risk. However, vulnerability in general usage includes any condition of exposure to hazards, risks and stresses. It can, for example, be that of an economy highly dependent on a few primary commodity exports, of a firm in a rapidly changing market, or of the illiterate in an increasingly literate environment. The health-related vulnerability of individuals and communities is reflected in patterns of morbidity, mortality, and reproduction, and is the product of various forms of social and economic deprivation acting simultaneously.'' 25 The essential points to remember from these definitions are that vulnerability:\n& is a multifaceted characteristic conditioned by individual, social, and structural factors, and that therefore any analysis must cover the entire chain of vulnerability, from the individual to the macroeconomic system; & is on the whole linked to a community's degree of development; & is characteristic of the most disadvantaged social strata (who lack information about the threat of a flood, live in precarious conditions, lack resources to cope with losses, etc.); & is sometimes -or often -linked to the development process itself, which may create the conditions for a disaster (chemical and nuclear accidents, for example). Impact A disaster's impact is the ''meeting'' between a harmful phenomenon and a group of vulnerable factors."
