"It affects the economic, social (including social and health-care organization), and political systems. . In conflict situations, food aid has a strong political connotation (the risk of ''feeding the enemy'') which tends to paralyze its implementation. A global comprehension of the issue of food aid is indispensable, even if dealing with it remains a complicated business. Chapter 3\n\n# WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH\nThe purpose of this chapter is not to train sanitation engineers able to carry out complex technical operations to improve water quality, for example, or to supply energy to a displaced population. The aim is, rather, to teach participants to do the following:\n-first, to identify those health problems that have some connection with environmental problems; -second, to recognize those situations where a sanitation specialist is needed to determine and implement the appropriate technical measures; -finally, if necessary, to take responsibility for the technical follow-up of the measures taken, and to evaluate their impact on the beneficiaries' health status. This field is relatively unfamiliar to health-care personnel, since it is not part of the standard curriculum of medical courses; 1 it may therefore be useful to describe very generally the interaction between a population and its environment, as well as the factors that influence that interaction. In terms of health, environmental interventions revolve around three key concepts: Survival Minimization of Risks Prevention\n\n# I. General Principles\nWhatever approach is adopted to address health problems must take into account the relations between a given population and its physical environment. In developed countries, the environment usually goes unnoticed; running water, housing, and sources of energy are all taken for granted. In developing countries, however, all this is much more difficult: water is several kilometers away and of poor quality; housing is flimsy, the environment is infested with communicabledisease vectors, the supply of energy is unreliable. In disaster situations, whatever their cause, mastering the environment becomes more than ever an essential task of the health-care system. Like access to food, access to water is a matter of life and death for populations who have been displaced or cut off from their usual resources. Waste disposal and vector control help considerably to prevent, or at least to reduce, the incidence of communicable diseases. 1 Meaning medical training in the broad sense (doctors, nurses, etc.)."
