"Article 3 is a miniature convention in itself, with three very important characteristics:\n. it is the only reference to non-international armed conflicts in the Conventions;\nit contains a summary of the main basic guarantees; \n\n# INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW\n\n# INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW\n\n# Peace\nArmed conflict Restoration of peace respect for goods essential to the population's survival, respect for cultural sites, etc.). For example, Protocol II additional to the four Geneva Conventions provides that: ''All the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, whether or not they have taken part in the armed conflict, shall be respected and protected.'' 14 Further on, it specifies:\n''Starvation of civilians as a method of combat is prohibited. It is therefore prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless, for that purpose, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works.'' 15\nThese rules are particularly important for health-care personnel in their efforts to protect and assist war victims. International human rights law directly concerns individuals and applies mostly to the individual's relations with the State."
