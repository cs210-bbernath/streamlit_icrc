"3 (1987). 59 Relief agencies can expect to wait for a period of up to three months between the moment they decide to import food from Europe and North America and the moment it arrives in the country. customs problems, if the food is bought abroad. # Food Transport and Storage\nThe issues involved in transporting food concern the entire period from the time the food leaves its source (whether it is purchased or donated) until it is used by the disaster victims. If the food must be imported and transported by boat -the usual caseconsideration should be given to the fact that delivery periods in the country where the operation is being conducted may be on the order of several months. Consequently, the urgency of the situation will be a prime factor in deciding whether the delivery period is acceptable, or whether different supply sources and/or means of transport need to be adopted to get the food to its destination more rapidly. Transport within a country is generally by means of trucks. For security reasons, however, in some cases only air transport may be possible, meaning a considerable increase in cost. 60 Moreover, the delivery of large quantities of food creates storage problems. Large-capacity warehouses must be found in which the food will be safe from bad weather, insects, rodents, and theft. Nor do the problems of transport and storage cease with the distribution of the food. Consideration must be given to the fact that the aid recipients must transport the food to their homes and store it. All these factors, together with the risk run by victims in conflict situations of having to ''participate in the war effort'' of one of the adversaries, 61 may influence the quantity of food given out at any one time. 60 A truck has more or less the same capacity as a plane of the Hercules type; but the cost of using the latter is 500 times greater. 61 Victims may be forced to ''give'' part of the food they receive to the combatants who control the region where the victims live. # The Practical Organization of a Food Distribution\n\n# Managing Crowds of Beneficiaries\nLarge-scale food distribution requires extremely careful organization; otherwise complete chaos is apt to ensue, hurting mostly the weakest, who are unable to demand their right to food aid. Normally food is distributed in the form of family rations. The relief organization registers each family, giving the head of the family a card indicating the number of family members. While food is being handed out, the crowd must be carefully controlled to insure that distribution is equitable 62 and swift. # Managing the Food to Be Distributed\nPlans should be made in advance for transport and on-site storage of the food, in order to avoid any interruption of supply in the course of distribution. Each family should receive a family ration calculated on the basis of the standard ration and the number of people in the family. # Managing Support Systems\nLarge-scale food distribution is accompanied by accessory measures such as the provision of drinking water and basic medical services."
