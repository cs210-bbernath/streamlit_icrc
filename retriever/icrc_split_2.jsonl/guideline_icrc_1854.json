"Breastfeeding and weaning practices play a major role in this framework. Feeding follows three phases: 0 to 4-6 months, 4-6 months until the completion of weaning (whose duration varies), and weaned infant feeding. 6\n6 Chapter VI discusses the general aspects of food consumption. # The themes of nutritional information\n5.2 Feeding infants and small children\n\n# Feeding infants (0 to 4-6 months)\nPoor practice\nInfants between 0 and 4-6 months should be exclusively breastfed. In the industrialized West however, breastfeeding is often replaced by bottle feeding with milk reconstituted from special powdered formulae. Clearly, the quality of such milk does not match maternal milk, and the use of bottles does not provide the same emotional bond between mother and child as breastfeeding does. The process itself does not entail immediate danger however, provided that it is properly followed; at the worst, it can increase the risk of obesity later. Therefore, refraining from breastfeeding in principle does not amount to poor practice. In a crisis however, it can expose the child to danger if manufactured substitutes happen to run out, and if the prevailing hygiene conditions preclude the safe preparation and preservation of milk which are essential in averting gastro-intestinal infection. On the other hand, where artifi cial feeding replaces breastfeeding without the material and cultural pre-conditions for the proper use of bottles and infant formula, the risk of morbidity and mortality is signifi cantly increased; in a crisis, they can reach disastrous proportions. In a crisis therefore, breastfeeding should be preserved or strengthened -this is doubtless one of the most effective ways of limiting the risk of infant morbidity and mortality. 7\nThe following types of poor practice are potentially most dangerous for health. As a result, breastfeeding should be generalized in countries where crises recur frequently. It is the only option open for consideration and should be promoted actively by humanitarian agencies. The promotion of breastfeeding is based on the following information. # General information regarding breastfeeding\nBreastfeeding is the best and most natural way to feed infants. In most cases, breastfeeding alone is enough from birth up to 4 to 6 months because maternal milk is a complete and balanced food whose composition evolves over time and also with the child's own development. The volume of 5. The themes of nutritional information 5.2 Feeding infants and small children Furthermore, comparing the nutritional value of human and cow's milk clearly reveals the advantages of maternal milk. 9 Energy: cow's milk and maternal milk share roughly the same energy content, but their energy density gradient is not the same. 9 Protein: cow's milk contains close to three times more protein than human milk does -this raises the urea plasma concentration beyond the norm and causes kidney overload. Moreover, cow's milk protein is less digestible than maternal milk protein. 9 Lipids: maternal milk lipids are more easily absorbed than those of cow's milk. 9 Glucides: the higher lactose content of maternal milk promotes the development of a specifi c intestinal fl ora that increases the acidity of the medium and inhibits the growth of pathogenic germs. 9 Minerals: the higher concentration of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium, and the lower calcium/phosphorus ratio in cow's milk could be one of the causes of neonatal tetany. Moreover, the higher electrolytes in cow's milk result in kidney overload, making it unsuitable for children under 3 months of age. In fact, the weak sodium excretion capacity, combined with fl uid loss (diarrhoea) can cause hypertonic dehydration leading to convulsions, sometimes neurological damage, and may be fatal depending on the degree of dehydration."
