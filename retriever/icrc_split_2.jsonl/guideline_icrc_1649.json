Light\n\n# Calorie content\nThe above parameters being set, the calorie content of food rations must be defi ned in order to satisfy all the energy requirements of the target population. In terms of temperature, specifi c recommendations exist, provided that the necessary complementary measures relating to habitat and thermal comfort are taken. The average weight per age and sex groups, the level of physical activity and the demographic profi le are defi ned by direct observation and measurements in each individual situation.
