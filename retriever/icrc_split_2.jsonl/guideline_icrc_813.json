"& Is political stability a factor in development? Situations of armed conflict by definition entail the breakdown of existing facilities, particularly the social services: education and health services are relegated to the background, far behind the services considered essential to the war effort. Under these conditions, development initiatives have practically no chance of implementation. Although political stability is essential to development, 11 what it represents must still be defined: a wide democratic consensus on general policies, or a dictatorship which imposes its own ''stability.'' 9 ''No sustained improvement in human well-being is possible without growth. But it is even more wrong to suggest that high economic growth rates will automatically translate into a higher level of human development."
