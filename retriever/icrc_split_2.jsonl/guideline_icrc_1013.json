"others or the commitments made towards others, joint decision-making, etc. This last point is crucial for the ICRC, since its role as a neutral, independent intermediary obliges it to preserve complete autonomy in its decision-making. In large-scale interventions, the ICRC may coordinate its intervention with those of other agencies; but it cannot be coordinated by them. This intransigence, founded on the demands of neutrality and independence, is not the sole preserve of the ICRC. Each agency has its own criteria for intervention and its own way of operating in the field. Nonetheless, humanitarian interventions must maintain a certain coherence. To achieve it, a model for interagency relations may be proposed."
