"can be broadly classified as manual pumps or mechanical pumps. The technical specifications of each pump will not be described here; this section will focus instead on the criteria for choosing a particular type of pump in a given situation. To avoid long lists, 22 decisionmakers should focus on two main criteria and a few secondary ones. The first criterion is the operating mechanism of the pump, which may be one of two types: -the water is drawn up from above towards the outlet. -the water is pushed up from below, to the pump outlet. In the first case, the operating cylinder is above the well; in the second, it is in the water."
