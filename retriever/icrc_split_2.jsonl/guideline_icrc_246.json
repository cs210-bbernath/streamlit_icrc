"Sand filter systems, in contrast, once installed, can be operated without any major input of materials. -Simplicity: Chemical treatment is the most complex of all the methods. If it is misused -for example, where the optimum dose is exceeded 35 -it can lead to health problems. -Reliability: Correctly implemented chemical treatment will destroy all the pathogenic germs in the water, whereas slow filtration does not provide total safety. 36 A combination of methods can also be used, such as a sand filter followed by chemical treatment of the filtered water. # Distribution\nThe entire water-carrying network from the source or the storage unit to the user constitutes the distribution system. As mentioned earlier, when the population is small and the water source is close to home, the user comes to fetch water directly from the source -a well equipped with a hand pump, for example, or a protected spring. In other circumstances, however, a distribution system will have to be set up. # Free Chlorine\n\n# Mobile Systems\nIn emergency situations, tank trucks may be used to transport water from its source to the displaced-person camps. Instead of each person coming to the truck for water, the contents of the truck can be emptied into static tanks hooked up to a network providing simultaneous distribution to several users at a time. # Permanent Systems\nThe classic water-distribution systems are permanent, and more or less ramified and complex depending on the circumstances. The options include:\n-a simple connection between a protected source and one or more public taps; -a public fountain equipped with several taps; -a pipe network carrying the water into the houses; -where the source is at a lower level, a distribution network equipped with pumps. # Selection Criteria\nIn choosing the type of distribution system, the primary considerations should be simplicity and easy access. Several aspects must be taken into account:\n& The distance between the distribution point and the user's home This point is not as obvious as it might seem. Although in general reducing the distance leads to an increase in water consumption, this relation has not been demonstrated in all cases. Studies in Tanzania and Morocco, for example, have not established a correlation between the proximity of access to water and the quantity used per person. 37 The reasons are numerous, including cultural habits, traditions, and a rejection of new technologies."
