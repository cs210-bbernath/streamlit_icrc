"again until the number of the total population is attained. \n# Sampling interval\n\n# Applications in Emergency Situations\nEmergency situations involving large populations provide ideal terrain for sampling of all kinds, whether the objective is to measure nutritional status, to study the incidence of basic medical problems, or to assess access to sources of potable water. In such situations, an estimate is made of the value to be measured and the limits between which the result should fall. The confidence level of the result obtained will therefore correspond to the desired approximation to the true value. It should be remembered that:\n."
