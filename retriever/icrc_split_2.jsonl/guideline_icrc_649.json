"It is also possible to formulate this hypothesis by ruling that the means observed come from a single population. In this case, 95% of the means obtained from n-sized samples of that population fall into the interval between +1.96 standard errors relative to the true mean. Accordingly, there is a 95% probability that the two means obtained will lie within this interval. To try to prove or disprove this hypothesis, the t test establishes the relation between the difference between the two means observed and the standard error of the difference, 42 which is a combination of the two standard errors inherent in each average: t = Difference between the two means Standard error of the difference 40 Value of chi squared: X 2 = (O -A)2 A where O = values observed in sample and A = values expected if there were no differences between the population groups. 41 Degree of freedom: When the number of values exceeds 4, we must take account of the degree of freedom, which is the number of values minus 1 in the column of tabulated values multiplied by the number of values minus 1 in the row of values. 42 The standard error of the difference is calculated as follows:\nCombined variance of the two variances of each sample s = (n 1 -1) (variance 1) 2 + (n 2 -1) (variance 2) 2 n 1 + n 2 -2 Standard error of the difference = sH1/n 1 +1/n 2 The t test formula becomes:\nt =\nDifference between the two means Standard error of the difference EPIDEMIOLOGY Logically, as the value of t increases, so does the probability of exceeding the limits of the confidence interval (between which 95% of the means of a single population should fall), and so does the certainty that the means observed in fact belong to two different populations -although always with some probability of error. The computation of this probability will depend on the value of t and the degree of freedom."
