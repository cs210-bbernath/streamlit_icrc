"made to the so-called \"emergency-rehabilitation-development continuum\" deserves further comment here. Indeed, Figure 9.3 may mislead the reader into believing that this Manual follows the \"continuum\" logic by adopting a linear approach to proposed action modes. However, Figure 9.3 only serves to illustrate the different stages of the crisis process and the possible action modes that they call for. Clearly, crisis can develop up or down the curve, or even oscillate, according to its causes and their evolution; it may be protracted to the point of never reaching the degree of recovery that would invite development efforts. As mentioned earlier, 11 a multidisciplinary approach is recommended in the different action modes described above."
