"This requires time and means, which humanitarian agencies sometimes lack, especially in overt crisis. Finally, the more risky the medium, the greater the need to apply strict hygiene standards -the degree of risk is defi ned by the quality of the water, access to safe water, disposal of waste water and garbage, habitat, vector control, and climate (temperature and humidity). Clearly, if the risk of infectious disease results mainly from an insalubrious environment, then water and habitat programmes are the fi rst defence against such risks, rather than lectures on food hygiene, however convincing they may be. This example again demonstrates the importance of tackling problems through multi-faceted integrated approaches. # Poor practice resulting in food contamination\nThe risk of consuming contaminated food is associated with the following behaviours:\n9 the use of visibly contaminated foods; 9 the premature preparation of food: it increases the risk of contamination before consumption, and harmful bacteria that have resisted the preparation process have more time to multiply; 9 insuffi cient cooking, which spares parasites and harmful bacteria; 9 contamination through contact (contaminated workbenches, utensils, and hands) and transfer to other foods (cross-contamination). NUTRITION MANUAL 5. The themes of Chapter XV -Nutritional information nutritional information 5.1 Food hygiene\n\n# Hygiene and food\n\n# Food storage and preservation\nQuality food storage is the fi rst stage of hygiene. Foodstuffs must be sheltered from rodents, birds, and insects; these can contaminate them directly, and/or open the way for additional contamination through the damage they cause. Foodstuffs must be sheltered from humidity, heat, and dust in order to avoid the spread of mould and bacteria, but also from light, which can likewise cause degradation. Storage space must be clean, closed but ventilated, easy to clean, and be sheltered from humidity and the elements. Cupboards, shelves protected by metal mesh (such as fi ne-meshed chicken wire), and suspended bags all offer good protection against insects and rodents. The food storage space must be treated against infestation regularly. Cats and mousetraps are also useful. Time must then be taken to inspect and supervise stocks and eliminate uninvited visitors and food commodities that have become unfi t for consumption. Some foodstuffs must be processed specially in order to protect them from rotting and mould; options include salting, drying, smoking, sterilization and/or preservation in a special medium such as brine, vinegar, sugar, alcohol, or fat. Such processes are however not without risk if they are performed domestically: utensils must be kept perfectly clean, foodstuffs must be washed and peeled carefully, and they must be prepared with previously boiled or safe drinking water. Preserved foodstuffs must then be regularly checked, spoiled items and traces of mould must be removed, and preservation ingredients added. # Choosing foodstuffs\nOnly quality foodstuffs must be selected according to the following criteria. The wrapping of deep-frozen foods must be intact, and the expiry date must not be past. Deep-frozen foods must be thawed in their intact wrapping, sheltered from contamination (especially from fl ies). Thawed foods must not be refrozen. 9 The odour and appearance of fresh foods must be pleasant; they must be devoid of bruises, mould and traces of predators."
