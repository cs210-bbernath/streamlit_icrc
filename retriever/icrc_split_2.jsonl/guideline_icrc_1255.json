"However, it is also possible to take 20 clusters of 25 subjects each: this still totals 500 subjects. The question therefore is whether it is best to have many clusters, and fewer subjects per cluster, or few clusters and more subjects in each. The purpose of cluster sampling is to minimize the effect of assumed heterogeneity in the area, because it is not possible or desirable to target more precisely. This minimization involves the scrutiny of prevalence rates in several sites, rather than the entire area, hence the choice of clusters. Usually then, it is best to select many clusters containing fewer subjects each. n = 1. Another approach consists in deciding arbitrarily to select 30 clusters of 30 subjects each. This practice is common in humanitarian assessment, and avoids tedious calculation and sampling error, and provides good results. For a 5% sampling error, the expected accuracy in relation to different expected prevalence rates is the following: Once the assessment has been completed, accuracy must be corrected by applying a formula that allows for the cluster effect. The closer the results for different clusters match, the closer accuracy is to the above fi gures."
