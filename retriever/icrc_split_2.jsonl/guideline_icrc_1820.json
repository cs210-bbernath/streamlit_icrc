"In principle, four to fi ve days per week should be devoted to distribution, with one day for stock replenishment, monitoring data management, and centre progress reporting. Alternatively, every business day can be devoted to distribution, with management and administrative tasks performed at the end of every day. Distribution days permit the verifi cation of benefi ciary status, bearing in mind that this takes more time than the distribution proper."
