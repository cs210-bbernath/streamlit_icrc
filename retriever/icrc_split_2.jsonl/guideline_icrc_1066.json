"constitutes a trauma for a population or an environment; . the idea of a vulnerable point which will bear the brunt of the traumatizing event;\n. the idea of the failure of local resources to cope with the problems created by the phenomenon. \n# Risk\nThe definition of risk must be associated with the idea of probability, which can be applied at two different levels: either to the phenomenon itself (the probability that a harmful event, such as an earthquake, flood, or conflict, will occur), or to that phenomenon's impact on the population and its environment. Although risk is commonly equated with the disaster itself, it really should be linked to the probability of a disaster's occurring."
