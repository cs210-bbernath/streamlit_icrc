"family refl ects average family size, as observed during registration. If the average family size turns out to be four individuals, for example, then four individual rations will be distributed to each family, regardless of its actual size. The set number of individuals per group of families is more arbitrary, and is defi ned on criteria that facilitate distribution. For example, families are grouped in units of twelve individuals each, and an amount corresponding to twelve individual rations is distributed to each of these groups; the latter then reallocate the resulting assistance internally according to actual family size. Set numbers of family members along demographic lines would seem a useful device for operating agencies, as it permits the preparation and distribution of standard rations."
