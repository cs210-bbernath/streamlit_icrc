"ratio between the number of latrines and the total population. Next comes an evaluation of the hygiene programs' impact on the beneficiaries' health, based on previously selected indicators. This is actually much more complex than it might at first seem. The evaluator must consider:\n-the validity of the indicators chosen. For example, is the incidence of diarrheal diseases indicative of the impact of a sanitation program? -the reliability of the information sources used. Not everyone may have the same definition of diarrhea.. -the incidence of all the variables -for instance, the importance of improved water, of latrine use, of education, etc., in reducing diarrheal diseases within a given population."
