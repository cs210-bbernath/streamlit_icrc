"In this example, an apparently normal behaviour in terms of consumption in fact reveals a serious disorder in the securing of food. Assessment in crisis must therefore question what may appear normal as well as apparent abnormalities. # The biological utilization of food\nProblems arise here from an insuffi cient food intake and poor health. Gaps may not be measured directly, because this phase takes place within the organism; however, gaps may be estimated by appraising the nutritional status and the health status, because the standard is defi ned as an absence of debilitating disorder and an acceptable nutritional status. 9\nTo conclude the identifi cation of problems, it is worth noting that a given phenomenon may have no impact on the feeding process at the time of assessment, but may have at a later stage."
