"confirmed by additional tests Additional tests may support a diagnosis. For example, a diagnosis may be confirmed by:\n-laboratory tests (to detect malaria, or to determine the degree of anemia); -x-rays (pneumonia or bone fractures); -bacteriological cultures (to determine the bacterium involved in bacterial meningitis). Analyzed in terms of the local context 18 and standard statistics on the main causes of morbidity or mortality in similar situations, the patient's symptoms in themselves are an adequate basis for proposing satisfactory therapeutic solutions. This approach, however, more empirical than scientific, poses the risk of numerous misdiagnoses (both false positives and false negatives)."
