"This number can vary between 20 and 100, depending on the operating agency and circumstances. The prevalence rate of severe malnutrition provides a useful indicator in setting this number, and this rate must then be compared to the size of the population, its geographic dispersion, and access to it. For example, in a camp that accommodates 10,000 persons whose demographic profi le is that of a developing country, 10% rate of severe malnutrition recorded in children under 6 years of age means that 150 children from this camp require TFC attention. This is feasible, because camps are rather easy to manage: individuals can be targeted easily, distances are reasonable, and access to the population is ensured. The situation is quite different in the case of a population of 10,000 nomads scattered over several thousand square kilometres, without transport facilities. In such cases, the feasibility of a therapeutic programme must be thoroughly examined even if severe malnutrition rates reach 20 or 30% in children under 6 -diffi culties of access, transport, family separation, and the identifi cation of malnourished individuals are all serious limiting factors. In situations of chronic marginal problems, programmes are justifi ed if the incidence of severe malnutrition is suffi ciently regular for even small therapeutic feeding units (i.e. with an accommodation capacity of 10 to 20 patients) to operate continuously."
