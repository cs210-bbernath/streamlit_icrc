"practical composition of rations is discussed in Section 3.1 below. \n\n# DISTRIBUTION METHODS\nDirect distributions involve the delivery of rations to their ultimate recipients by the operating agency itself; in indirect distributions, rations are handed over to the community, which then distributes them to its members. Direct distribution is always best, especially in armed confl ict, in order to ensure that the food does indeed reach its intended benefi ciaries. Misuse and corruption are all too common in the case of indirect distribution, and they are impossible to correct later. The legitimacy of the operating agency and donors is also at stake."
