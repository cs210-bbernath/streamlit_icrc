"This is the ICRC's modus operandi. Proximity to the victims allows observers to verify on the spot whether or not the rules of international humanitarian law are actually being respected. In this respect, access to the victims is a major concern for the ICRC. The record on the application of international humanitarian law has so far been depressing: an increasing number of conflicts, in the course of which populations are attacked indiscriminately and refused the right to humanitarian relief. Those States which are not parties to the conflict also have a certain responsibility when it comes to violations of international humanitarian law. Article 1 common to the Geneva Conventions 27 requires of them that they make an effort to ensure respect for the law in all circumstances by taking the appropriate practical measures:\n. a delegate can make oral representations to the local authorities;\n."
