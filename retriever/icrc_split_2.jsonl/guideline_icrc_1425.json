"This concentrated source of energy contributes especially to increasing the energy density of the diet of infants, and is evidently important in nutritional rehabilitation. Moreover, it alleviates the logistical burden in terms of transport. As a result, a ration that supplies approximately 20% of the overall energy in the form of oil is no luxury; this is therefore the minimum recommended here for basic rations that contain no other fat-rich foods. As a reminder, diets that are poor in lipids and aim at preventing cardio-vascular disease\n\n# GFD implementation\n3.2 Setting rations should always account for at least 10% of the overall calorie intake. Cereals must not be replaced with legumes, because the latter are not easily digested and are sometimes slightly toxic; legumes should not account for more than 15% of the overall calorie intake. Legumes cannot be replaced with cereals either, as this would result in a protein and vitamin defi cit with respect to energy; in brief, cereals and legumes are not interchangeable. On the other hand, legumes and cereals may both be partly replaced with foods that supply identical amounts of energy and protein, while also supplying an additional benefi t in terms of fl avour and micro-nutrients: frequently, these are cereal and pulse fl our blends enriched in vitamins and minerals (e.g. corn soy blend, or CSB), but also meat or fi sh preserves."
