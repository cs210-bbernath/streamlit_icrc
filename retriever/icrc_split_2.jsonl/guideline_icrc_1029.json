"cultural and religious intolerance . # ethnic discrimination\nThese problems can be solved through development, the word ''development'' being used here in its broadest sense, that is to say, including reduction of poverty, elimination of all forms of discrimination and promotion of tolerance. Humanitarian action in behalf of the victims of armed conflicts also helps to promote peace, by maintaining in the midst of war a humanitarian enclave of dialogue and understanding between the parties which in some cases can serve as a starting-point for the resumption of the peace process. ''War'' and ''development'' are a priori antonyms, the one seeking to destroy and the other to construct. A return to peace is the essential condition for the resumption of a real development process after a war. # MISSION\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is an impartial, neutral and independent organization whose exclusively humanitarian mission is to protect the lives and dignity of victims of war and internal violence and to provide them with assistance. It directs and coordinates the international relief activities conducted by the Movement in situations of conflict. It also endeavours to prevent suffering by promoting and strengthening humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles. Established in 1863, the ICRC is at the origin of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. This manual is intended for staff members and medical personnel responsible for humanitarian activities in armed conflict situations. It deals with the serious health problems affecting displaced people and shows, step by step, how a health-care system meeting the essential needs of war victims can be set up in these situations. The public health tools most frequently used in armed conflicts for evaluation, establishment of priorities, analysis of possible activities and their follow-up are assessed in the light of the constraints encountered in the field. The problem of protection for war victims is also discussed in connection with certain aspects of international humanitarian law, particularly those directly relating to health. Finally, the handbook offers professional health workers a guide to the ethical problems that arise at the main stages of humanitarian action. ''Human dignity is generally very severely affected by the fact of having to leave one's home on account of events associated with armed hostilities or other forms of violence, because of the utter dependence in which the displaced persons find themselves."
