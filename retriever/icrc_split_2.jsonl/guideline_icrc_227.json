"of the two factors just described, water quantity and quality. Many studies have been carried out to determine the respective importance of each factor in health status, and particularly in the incidence of diarrheal illnesses. The general consensus is that the quantity of water takes precedence over the quality:\n''The impact of water supply and sanitation on diarrhoea, related infections, nutritional status, and mortality is analysed by reviewing 67 studies from 28 countries. The mean reductions in diarrhoea morbidity rates are 22% from all studies and 27% from a few better-designed studies. All studies of the impact on total mortality rates show a median reduction of 21%, while the few better-designed studies give a median reduction of 30%."
