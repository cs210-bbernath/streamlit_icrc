"If milling costs devolve upon the ultimate recipients, losses and expenses can be substantial, and it is best in such cases to resort to fl our (if possible enriched in micronutrients, in order for recipients to obtain the intended food ration). If cereal grain is distributed, then milling losses must be allowed for, and the amount must be increased accordingly. Such an increase raises the corresponding logistics and costs by at least 20% (at least 10% material loss and 10% milling costs), which results in more expenses than preliminary industrial milling. See Chapter XIII on therapeutic feeding."
