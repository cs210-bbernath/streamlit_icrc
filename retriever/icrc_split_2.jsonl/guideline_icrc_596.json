"The size of the sample, too, depends on a group of factors: the degree of accuracy desired, the prevalence of the problem, and the confidence interval. 7\n\n# Presentation of Results\nThe results obtained from a survey or by means of a surveillance system are difficult to interpret until they have been processed into a more digestible form. Converting them into percentages, rates, tables, and graphs facilitates the synthesis of data. The way that results are to be presented will affect the way the data are collected. For example, if rates of anemia in a population are to be categorized by age groups, then age must be included in the data collected. First-hand information is more reliable than second-hand. The analysis of trends, based on the measurement of the same indicator at regular intervals, is often more instructive than the analysis of a single measurement."
