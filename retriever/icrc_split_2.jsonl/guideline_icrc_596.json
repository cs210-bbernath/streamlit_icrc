"indicators chosen relevant? -Was the size of the sample adequate? -Were the data recorded correctly? \n# Statistical Methods Used to Interpret the Data\n-What confidence interval is used? -What test is used? \n# Decision-Making\nEpidemiologists can avoid relying on false data by following epidemiological procedures strictly; but just because the data are correct does not necessarily mean that the reasoning derived from them is correct. The facts must be critically interpreted within their context. For example, is a variation in the incidence of diarrheal diseases in a refugee camp due to a deterioration in hygiene in the camp, or is it a natural seasonal change?"
