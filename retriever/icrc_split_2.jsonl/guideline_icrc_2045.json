Foods that are eaten raw should be washed carefully with clean water, or peeled. They may be soaked in salted or chlorinated water. Fresh foods are in principle prepared the same day in the absence of refrigerators; even refrigerated meat, fi sh, and milk can usually only be kept for two days at most."
