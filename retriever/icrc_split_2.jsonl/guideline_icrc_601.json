"but especially to permit a correct interpretation of the situation. If, for example, a famine is expected, efforts must be made to find out whether there is:\n. a nutritional deficit;\n. a food crisis;\n. an agricultural crisis;\n. an ecological crisis. Anthropometric measurements allow epidemiologists to follow the development of a population's nutritional status and to detect any deterioration. If these are combined with the measurement of indicators reflecting access to food resources, a food crisis can be detected before it influences the population's nutritional status and the necessary measures can then be taken. Further back in the food chain, surveillance of agricultural activities will allow relief organizers to anticipate a crisis in access to food resources."
