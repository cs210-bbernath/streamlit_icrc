"The justifi cation for the programme, its admission criteria, and the criteria for its termination and the withdrawal of the operating agency deserve specifi c explanations. # Meals\nFull rations must be supplied in the form of two meals a day at least, preferably three, and obviously at set times, which must be observed by all kitchens involved in the programme (for example, 10:00 am and 3:00 pm, or 09:00 am, 1:00 pm and 5:00 pm). Kitchens must operate every day of the week. Meals must imperatively be eaten on site, so as to ensure that the food is actually consumed by the benefi ciaries, and in order to help small children and the sick with their meal. The food must be of good quality, and it must be sorted and sieved if necessary. It must be cooked in time, but not too early in order to be served hot, and cooking utensils, crockery and cutlery must be properly washed after each meal. Water must be made available to the benefi ciaries for their ablutions, in addition to drinking water (1 to 2 litres per person per day) if they have no other access to it. If legumes are used, they must be washed and then soaked in cold water for ten to twelve hours before cooking; they must then be cooked with oil for approximately two hours and then seasoned with salt, etc.-kitchen staff is usually familiar with the optimum cooking time for staple foods if they correspond to local eating habits (which should of course be the case). 3.7 GFD termination 3."
