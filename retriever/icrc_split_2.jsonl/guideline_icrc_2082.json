It is best to supply them after breastfeeding, beginning with a single type of food and waiting for a few days for the child to grow used to it before introducing another fl avour. The fi rst food can be cereal porridge, mashed boiled tubers, or fruit stew (ripe banana is a good option). Initially, the equivalent of 2 teaspoonfuls is enough, fed in small amounts -it should always be fed with a spoon, and not by hand. The exercise requires patience, and the child must be allowed to taste, test, enjoy, and spit without haste."
