Any defi cit in the means and any deviation from the standard cause an imbalance between the demands arising from the need, and the satisfying of such demands. Chapter VI showed that imbalance may be normal: in this case, it usually expresses cultural and natural variations, which are allowed for by coping mechanisms that avert harmful consequences. Sometimes, the magnitude and duration of events exceed the coping ability of security mechanisms. This heralds the beginning of crisis. Such events amount to phenomena that (directly or indirectly) cause attacks on the implementation of the feeding process, which has grown vulnerable to such events."
