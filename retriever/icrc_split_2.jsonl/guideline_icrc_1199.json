"To determine the secondary, and possibly negative, effects of the operation. In the above example of food distributions on the Angolan Planalto, the objective was to reduce severe malnutrition prevalence rates from 30% to 10%, and those of moderate malnutrition from 40% to 20% within three months. The operation may be evaluated by measuring the nutritional status on a monthly basis, in order to detect trends early enough, and combine this measure with the collection of data as to the nature of the observed malnutrition, the impact observed by the population itself, and secondary and negative effects."
