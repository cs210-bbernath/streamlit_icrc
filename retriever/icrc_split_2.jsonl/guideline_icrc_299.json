"Similarly, in developing countries, most individuals over the age of five can be assumed to have been exposed to the tubercle bacillus, though it is impossible to say what percentage of them will actually develop tuberculosis. Another factor is malnutrition: malnourished children are particularly susceptible to infections. Thus, a study carried out in the Philippines in 1988 estimated that among children whose weight-for-age ratio was less than 60%, the risk of dying from an acute respiratory infection was 27 times higher than for children whose weight-for-height ration was over 90%; it was 11 times higher for children for whom this ratio was between 60% and 74%, and 4 times higher for 75%-89%. 6 It is impossible to determine the immunity level of each individual in a population, but the groups at risk -those who are naturally most vulnerable to\nDerek Robinson, ed., Epidemiology and the Community Control of Disease in Warm Climate Countries, 2nd ed."
