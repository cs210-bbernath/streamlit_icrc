"9 Target communities should be involved in the operational planning, implementation, and evaluation processes. 9 Proposed changes should be simple, context-specifi c, and be expected to improve health substantially; they should comply with cultural standards and not upset them. 9 Proposed changes should refer to positive deviants 5 as examples in order to avoid becoming excessively theoretical. 9 Key messages should be kept clear and simple, they should be repeated regularly, and be tested as often as possible. The three guiding principles of teaching are: what is only heard is forgotten, what is seen is more likely to be recalled, but only what has been practised is remembered. 9 Each session should be limited to the delivery of one key message only."
