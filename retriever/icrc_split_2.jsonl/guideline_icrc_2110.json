"belief in the particular properties of milk as a food. \n# POLICY\nBecause there have been problems associated with the indiscriminate distribution of milk, the International Red Cross has found it necessary to draw up the following policy for its distribution in relief actions. In relief actions the International Red Cross will only distribute artifi cial milks to those populations who traditionally use milk in their diets and only then under strictly controlled and hygienic conditions. The International Red Cross will not use artifi cial milk as an item for general distribution (dry rations) nor as a \"take-away supplement\". \n# Donations of artifi cial milks for Red\nCross relief actions should only be made following a specifi c appeal for the same through the International Red Cross."
