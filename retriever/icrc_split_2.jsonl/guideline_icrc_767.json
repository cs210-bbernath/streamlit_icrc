"homes of all the potential patients is a utopian dream. In these countries, the remoteness of health centers is a problem difficult to surmount. In disaster situations, when communications are even more trouble-ridden than usual, the gap between health facilities and victims becomes even wider. A few comments should be made about the institution of mobile teams which visit villages and displaced-person camps every two to four weeks for a more direct access to victims. This approach is indicated for prophylactic activities such as immunizations and hygiene programs, which do not require daily follow-up. Mobile teams that deliver medical care, in contrast, do nothing to control serious cases of disease, because access to the population is too sporadic."
