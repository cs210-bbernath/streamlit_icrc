"urgency of an effective intervention. The replacement strategy also solves another problem -that of neutrality, when there is a risk that one party to the conflict will consider humanitarian aid to the facilities of the other party as evidence that the humanitarian intervention is not neutral. Despite its advantages, replacement strategy must be limited to those situations where the local facilities do not meet the criteria of neutrality and efficiency called for by an emergency situation. Thus, to insure coverage of a population's need for hospital care, for example, a humanitarian agency could:\n. reestablish access to health facilities that are inaccessible to certain groups of victims;\n. assist local health-care facilities by furnishing the equipment necessary for proper functioning;\n. build a hospital independent of the local health system. What should the policy be concerning a medical facility that has the human but not the material resources needed to treat patients, and which refuses to treat people from a particular ethnic group? There are four options:\n. Assist the facility, since the aid supplied will be used to treat at least part of the population -although this amounts to accepting discrimination. Negotiate until the facility agrees to accept all patients without discrimination, then assist it -realizing, however, that if the facility refuses, the population will be deprived of necessary care. Assist the facility in spite of everything, and negotiate to obtain access for all. Although a means of pressuring the authorities will thereby be lost, the aid will help at least part of the population. The relief agency offers access to care to one population group, but without accepting the discrimination against the other group. The threshold of tolerance remains to be defined, as well as an acceptable time limit for concluding the negotiations."
