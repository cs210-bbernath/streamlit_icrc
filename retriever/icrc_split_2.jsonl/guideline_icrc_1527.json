"analytical tool and, following hypothesis confi rmation, a presentation tool. Constructing a relative vulnerability matrix requires that diversity be qualifi ed in terms of: 9 vulnerability factors; 9 population types; 9 ability to cope with crisis, that is, resilience. It also requires the formulation of hypotheses relating to problems caused by crisis and their consequences. The matrix permits the identifi cation of priorities according to operational content, location, and benefi ciaries. Table 10.5 below provides a theoretical example of a relative vulnerability matrix in relation to Sahelian conditions. The vulnerability factor is drought, and the survey is conducted during the fourth successive year of drought."
