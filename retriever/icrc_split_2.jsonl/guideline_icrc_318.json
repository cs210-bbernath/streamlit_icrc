"all factors that help increase the transmission of communicable diseases. \n# Deterioration of Health Services\nThe deterioration of health services affects disease transmission at all levels. For example, no vaccinations are given, vector-control programs deteriorate, and little or no care is provided for the sick. Thus, not only do the risks increase in an emergency situation (fertile breeding ground for infections, increased transmission), but, in addition, the means of disease control are usually inadequate, if not nonexistent. All these factors contribute, in varying degrees, to an increased incidence of communicable diseases (sometimes to the point of actual epidemics), as well as to a greater severity of clinical manifestations, reflected in the mortality rates for specific infections."
