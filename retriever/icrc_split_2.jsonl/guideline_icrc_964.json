Assisting victims in the territory of the enemy is considered as support for the enemy's war effort rather than a humanitarian act. \n# Proportionality of Needs\nFrom the ethical point of view, humanitarian relief should be adapted to needs. This means that in a situation involving victims on both sides, but with more needs on one side than the other, more aid will be given where the need is greater."
