"The CHWs' volume of activity depends on their skill, their acceptance by the population, and, especially, their motivation. Although very uncertain, these figures give an indication of volume of work in a dispensary. At the beginning of an intervention, the number of consultations required to attend to the medical needs of 10,000 refugees will be 100-150 per day. This figure provides a basis for determining the number of medical staff and the quantity of drugs 41 necessary. # Hospital Care\nSimilarly, it can be estimated that for a total population, 40-50 per 1,000 will need to be hospitalized. 42 Thus, for a population of 50,000 refugees, the relief team should reckon on 2,500 patients being hospitalized per year. If an average hospital stay is figured at seven days, this works out to 18,000 days of hospitalization. Accordingly, provision must be made for a hospitalization capacity of 50 beds. 43 All these figures should be considered as very vague estimates which merely give an idea of the number of patients that can be expected in this type of situation. It is useful to know that for 50,000 people, a hospital with a maximum of 50-100 beds is needed, rather than a hospital with 500 beds. # SUMMARY OF QUANTITATIVE NEEDS\nTaking as a basis: 4 consultations/person/year hospitalization rate of 40/1,000 average period of hospitalization = 7 days It can be estimated that: 1% of the population will be seen by a medical worker each day 1% of those examined will have to be hospitalized 1 hospital bed will be needed for every 1,000 people 41 Lists established by WHO give the quantities of drugs and other supplies necessary to cover the needs of 10,000 refugees for three months. 42 Excluding war-wounded, whose numbers cannot be predicted."
