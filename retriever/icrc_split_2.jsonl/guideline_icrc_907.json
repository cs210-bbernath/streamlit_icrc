"11 Despite this last provision, the text was adopted only after long negotiations with the States which saw it as interference in their internal affairs. 12 International \n\n# ''Article 3\nIn the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions:\n(1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria. To this end, the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons: (2) The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for. An impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, may offer its services to the Parties to the conflict. The Parties to the conflict should further endeavour to bring into force, by means of special agreements, all or part of the other provisions of the present Convention. The application of the preceding provisions shall not affect the legal status of the Parties to the conflict.'' non-combatants and the manner in which hostilities are to be conducted. The application of international humanitarian law must come to terms with military necessity: ''The law of war can only be, in fact, a law of compromise between military necessity and humanitarian requirements.'' 13 This pragmatism, however, must not be interpreted as surrender to the armed forces present. The neutrality and impartiality of the humanitarian agencies allow them to negotiate with the authorities in charge of the military operations so that humanitarian requirements are respected to the extent necessary to protect the victims of the conflict. The creation of a humanitarian ''space'' in situations of armed conflict will gain wider acceptance if humanitarian organizations are indeed seen by the parties to the conflict to be neutral and impartial. # Distinction Between International Humanitarian\nLaw and International Human Rights Law\n\n# Fields of Application\nInternational humanitarian law applies to situations of armed conflict, whereas international human rights law is applicable to all circumstances. Nonetheless, although international hum a n r i g h t s l a w i s , l i k e international humanitarian law, applicable in situations of armed conflict, various factors tend to weaken its impact on them. As a result, international humanitarian law is dominant in this field. International humanitarian law is a body of rules that the parties to a conflict must respect. These rules concern the parties' treatm e n t o f n o n -c o m b a t a n t s (wounded, shipwrecked, prisoners of war, political prisoners, civilian populations), and also the parties' attitude towards the established systems (respect for the environment, 13 Maurice Torelli, Le droit international humanitaire (Presses Universitaires de France, 1985), p."
