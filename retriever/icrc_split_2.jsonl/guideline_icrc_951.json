"Accept the discrimination and find another solution for the excluded groupfor example, providing a new facility for it. What should be the policy concerning a civilian population whose vital needs are not covered and who are suffering from extortion by an armed group? There are three possibilities:\n. Withhold assistance in order to protest the treatment meted out to the civilian population. This amounts to delivering a death sentence against the civilians, who will lack food, medical care, and other necessities, so that in fact it is the victims and not those responsible for the extortion who are penalized. Intervene without comment."
