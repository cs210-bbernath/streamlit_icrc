"Treatment outlines are provided in Chapter XIII. # Management of the centre\nThese features are the same for supplementary feeding programme (SFP) and therapeutic feeding centres (TFC). They have been discussed in Chapter XIII, Section 3.3.8. # Other activities\nSFP centres delivering rations to be eaten on the spot offer the opportunity for other activities than meal distribution, healthcare and recovery monitoring -which must, nevertheless, remain the centre's central tasks. Such additional activities are described in Chapter XIII, Sections 3.3.9 and 4.3.3. # SFP centre structure, equipment and human resources\nWith a simplifi ed structure and services, centres providing meals to be eaten on the spot are similar to the therapeutic feeding centres (TFC) discussed in Chapter XIII; readers should refer to Sections 3.1, 3.1.1, 3.1.2 and 3.1.3, and use common sense to adapt the recommendations they contain. Therefore, only aspects specifi c to SFP centres are discussed here. In a centre restricted to the distribution of take-away rations, activities are limited to benefi ciary registration and discharge, monitoring their nutritional and health progress, and the distribution of food. Its structure is accordingly simpler. The SFP centre must be located as close as possible to the population it aims to support. Where rations are to be eaten on the spot, the centre must not be located further than a 30 minute walk away -2 hours in the case of take-away rations. This is not because relatives could travel no further, but to allow time for benefi ciary progress monitoring."
