"access to safe water must be suffi cient and regular. A programme is justifi ed as from a given number of benefi ciaries, which is determined by the magnitude of the malnutrition problem. In practice, crisis situations (where severe malnutrition rises, and national services are non-existent or saturated) must be distinguished from chronic situations (where severe malnutrition is endemic and seasonal, and national services are non-existent or insuffi cient). In crisis situations, the number of patients is the determining parameter. In famine, the number of severely malnourished subjects is always suffi cient to justify therapeutic feeding and the introduction of a TFC."
