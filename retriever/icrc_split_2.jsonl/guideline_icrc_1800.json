"It must be made clear to all involved that these SFPs serve a warning purpose by revealing the inadequacy of the current intervention. In practical terms, the question is whether the palliative SFP implementation criterion should be malnutrition thresholds -for instance, more than 15% of children rating two standard deviations less than the median weight-for-height index value. The answer should be negative -once again, the situation's specifi city and common sense should take precedence over arbitrary thresholds. In targeting moderate malnutrition specifi cally, the rate of this malnutrition will infl uence the decision to intervene less than the potential number of benefi ciaries will, which can only increase as the crisis develops and preventive measures remain ineffective. If the population under consideration is large and concentrated, low rates of moderate malnutrition would justify the opening of one or several SFP centres; on the other hand, if the population is small and scattered, even high malnutrition rates may not necessarily be conclusive. Furthermore, the objective of the SFP is also the deciding factor: if the purpose is to contain a crisis, one can begin with twenty benefi ciaries, while preparing to accommodate a thousand in the coming months."
