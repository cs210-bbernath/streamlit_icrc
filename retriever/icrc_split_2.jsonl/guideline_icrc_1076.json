"3. Humanitarian ethics 3.4 Ethics concerning donors\n\n# Authorities\nTransparency is a must in dealing with host authorities, as is the observance of local and national rules and standards. The latter include regulations that apply to road traffi c, importation practices, and the treatment of contagious disease. Clearly, local traffi c regulations do not warrant further discussion here; but humanitarians may be confronted with health standards that are inappropriate in view of the circumstances of a given crisis. The issue is not to follow regulations blindly, but to devote careful thought to them, and always weigh the interest of the victims against the preservation or strengthening of national services."
