"and of existing problems, or the results of pilot studies. When a prevalence rate cannot be estimated with suffi cient accuracy, it is arbitrarily set at 50% -this rate gives the largest sample (for equal sampling error and confi dence intervals) according to the formula below. This avoids unpleasant surprises in the calculation, because the further the real rate is located from 50% (plus or minus), the greater accuracy will be achieved for a given sample. \n# NUTRITION MANUAL\nChapter X -Assessment and planning 3. General aspects I. Assessment of assessment methods 3.4 Selecting subjects\nOnce the intended accuracy is determined for a 5% sampling error and that expected prevalence rates have been set, sample size \"n\" may be calculated based on the following formula: -----d 2\np \u00d7 q n = \u03b5 2 \u00d7 -\nWhere: n = the number of subjects in the sample \u03b5 = 1.96, the factor determining the sampling error at 5% p = the expected prevalence rate, say 20% q = 100 -p d = the required accuracy expressed in \u00b1 d%, say \u00b1 5%\nThe resulting equation for this example is then as follows:\n20 \u00d7 (100-20) n = 1.96 2 \u00d7 ----------------= 246 5 2 If the sampling error is reduced to 1%, then \u03b5 equals 2.576 and, consequently, the sample size \"n\" rises to 425."
