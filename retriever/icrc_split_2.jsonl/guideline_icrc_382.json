"the theoretical technical effectiveness of control measures is often impaired. The reduction of mortality from Plasmodium falciparum malaria depends in part on the diagnosis and rapid treatment of cases. Yet how effectively can this be done in a migrating population for whom the quest for food, water, and safety takes priority? \n# V. Examples of Programs to Control Communicable Diseases\nCommunicable diseases can be controlled by proper coordination of a series of measures implemented for that purpose. The combinations possible depend on both the diseases in question and the context in which they are found. The constraints of emergency situations -particularly conflicts -limit the possibility of taking all the steps which, together, would control the communicable diseases effectively."
