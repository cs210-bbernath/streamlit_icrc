"to achieve a given concentration of chlorine in the water. In contact with water, the chemical dissolves and releases free chlorine. This free chlorine sets on the particles, notably organic particles that contain carbon, through oxidation. Particles that are living organisms (e.g. virus, bacteria) are destroyed by chlorine oxidation. Water purifi cation is completed when all particles have been bound by the chlorine. Free chlorine is thus consumed by purifi cation; consequently, the process may be considered to be completed when free chlorine remains in the water after a given contact period (this period varies according to the amount of water)."
