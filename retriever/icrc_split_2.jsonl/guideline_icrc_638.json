"than two standard errors from the true value (x errors). The formula 1.96 = z (where z is the number of standard errors between the true mean and the sample mean) is important to remember, for it appears in numerous statistical calculations. & Confidence limits:\nThe confidence limits are equivalent to the degree of accuracy. This corresponds to the acceptable number of standard errors multiplied by the standard error itself:\nd = z x SE. Since SE is unknown, 25 The standard error is calculated as follows:\nStandard error = standard deviation (estimated by sample) square root of the size of the sample 26 Values under 95% are not normally taken, but 99% can be taken as a confidence level."
