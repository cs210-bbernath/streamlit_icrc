"short of a comprehensive survey will yield fully accurate results. \n# General aspects of assessment methods\n3.4 Selecting subjects\nThe quality of sampling rests upon three principles:\n9 the sample must be taken from a group that is as homogenous as possible with respect to the variable under scrutiny; 9 all individuals in the group must have equal probabilities of being selected for inclusion in the sample (probability sampling); 9 the result must be suffi ciently accurate. \n# Group homogeneity\nSampling consists in selecting individuals from a group (or \"population\") so that, by studying the features of this sample, the results may fairly be extrapolated to the group from which the sample was taken; the group must therefore be homogenous with respect to the variable, or characteristic, under consideration and to its affecting factor."
