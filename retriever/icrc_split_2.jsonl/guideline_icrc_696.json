"A routine surveillance system can be set up, through which the collected data are channeled every day, week, or month to the appropriate person or center for analysis. This is the ''passive'' system, which consists in waiting for the information to arrive. The second method involves starting an ''ad hoc'' survey. This kind of evaluation may be repetitive -for example, measuring a population's nutritional status at regular intervals."
