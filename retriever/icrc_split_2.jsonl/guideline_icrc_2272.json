"account for at least 1/5 of the daily food intake. \n\n# Handling of food\nMilk must be consumed immediately after its preparation, because milk contaminated by pathogens quickly becomes toxic. This is due to the following:\n9 its composition: it contains basic free nutrients that can be directly absorbed by microbes; 9 its liquid state: the Brownian motion 38 quickly scatters contaminating bacteria, not to mention the shaking of containers by preparers and consumers; 9 its consumption temperature for a long period corresponds to the optimum temperature for bacterial growth. Furthermore, it can be quickly contaminated by the pathogens that thrive in a TFC."
