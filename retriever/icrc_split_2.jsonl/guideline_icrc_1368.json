"Therefore, the development of international humanitarian law is not abstract, and takes the reality of military operations fully into account. It allows for the diffi culty of ensuring an exclusively civilian use of foodstuffs, and attempts to limit exceptions to their strict minimum. An expansion of exceptions would, in fact, severely undermine the prohibition of starvation of civilians as a means of warfare. In view of the diffi culty of ensuring an exclusively civilian use of foodstuffs, it is legitimate to wonder whether foodstuffs should be included in blockades or methods of control. In terms of the provision of relief, Protocol I also develops the dispositions of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, and addresses the following features:\n9 the principle applies to situations in which the civilian population is not adequately provided with indispensable supplies such as foodstuffs, medical supplies, clothing, bedding and emergency shelter; 9 the principles applies to all civilians, and not only restrictive categories; 9 the parties to the confl ict are required to \"protect relief consignments\" and \"facilitate their rapid distribution\" (article 70, paragraph 4 of Protocol I); 9 the \"effective international coordination\" of such relief actions is encouraged (article 70, paragraph 5 of Protocol I). The overall idea that seems to emerge from international humanitarian law provisions regarding relief actions is that the natural manner of avoiding starvation in armed confl ict is the dispatch of food relief to starving populations. However, the experiences of the past twenty years or so demonstrate that this approach may sometimes be inevitable, but nevertheless requires great care."
