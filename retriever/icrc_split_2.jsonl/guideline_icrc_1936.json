"maintenance requirements, nor those associated with physical activity and/or thermo-genesis. As a result, a regular and adequate diet must be provided in order to avoid energy requirements not being met in time through a metabolic reversal towards catabolism. This usually entails hypoglycaemia, followed by hypothermia and death, especially in infants. This aspect is all the more important in view of the fact that nutritional catch-up is calorie and energyintensive, requiring 5 kcal (21 kJ) and 0.16 g of protein per gram of recovered tissue. Rapid catch-up (in the order of 20 g/kg/day) implies that the proportion of food that it requires is equal to or greater than maintenance requirements."
