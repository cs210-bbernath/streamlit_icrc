"agencies may not have the necessary skills to do this. Strengthening survival mechanisms is indeed a fashionable pursuit. However, coping mechanisms are often confused with survival mechanisms (these permit mere survival and have their limits), to the detriment of exploring new, sustainable forms of resource utilization that could ensure durable economic security. Granted, need can open the way for innovation and creativity; however this is by far not a general rule. The investigation of alternative avenues should not provide a pretext to delay action when a given group faces deteriorating economic circumstances, or to target only those that that are already in poor shape."
