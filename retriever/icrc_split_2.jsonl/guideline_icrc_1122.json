"comes from the Italian pelle meaning skin, and agra, rough. Pellagra is usually associated with other defi ciencies -primarily in tryptophan, an essential amino-acid, and a precursor of niacin. Tryptophan can contribute substantially to niacin intake, provided it is excessive with respect to protein requirements and the amino-acid homeostasis. Pellagra is usually related to defi ciency in ribofl avin and vitamin B 6 (pyridoxine), which contribute to the conversion of tryptophan into niacin. Furthermore, anaemia always concurs with pellagra. Consequently, pellagra is considered as resulting from a multiple defi ciency, rather than from niacin defi ciency alone. Pellagra is associated with diets whose protein supply (and, hence, the energy supply) is accounted for by maize, mainly."
