"Part of the water is blended into the pre-mix until all lumps have been absorbed. The remaining water is then added up to the total intended volume, and the resulting porridge is cooked gently for about 30 minutes, stirring frequently. Before serving, the vitamin-mineral complement 37 is added and mixed in well. This porridge supplies approximately 130 kcal (540 kJ) and 3.3 g of protein/100 ml with a P/E ratio of 10%. # Other foods\nOther foods may also be supplied, for example to be taken home or eaten on site with or between meals. Such foods include high-energy biscuits (whose composition should be as close as possible to that of F-100 Formula), special peanut paste that is equivalent to one F-100 Formula meal (e.g. Plumpy'nut produced by Nutriset) that supplies 500 kcal (2,090 kJ) for one 92 g sachet, and fruit. Such products derive their appeal from the fact that they require no preparation or cooking."
