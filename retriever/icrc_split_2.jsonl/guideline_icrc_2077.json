"risk of illness and death if they are not breastfed. However, when these conditions are not fulfi lled, in particular in an environment where infectious diseases and malnutrition are the primary causes of death during infancy, artifi cial feeding substantially increases children's risk of illness and death.\" (WHO, 1998). Furthermore, it remains unclear to what extent breastfeeding infl uences HIV development in mothers. The observation that the combination of a good nutritional status and appropriate healthcare substantially limit the progress of the illness is, in a sense, alarming (McAskill, 2000). It indicates that breastfeeding and the resulting drainage of maternal nutritional resources in favour of the child could increase the mother's vulnerability -this would tend to argue in favour of substituting maternal milk with artifi cial alternatives if feasible."
