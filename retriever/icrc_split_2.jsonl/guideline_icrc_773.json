"# The Health-Care Pyramid\nThe health-care systems proposed for emergency situations are structured like a pyramid, the base being the keystones of health: access to food resources, access to clean water, and proper environmental hygiene. On this base rest public health measures such as immunization, health education, control of epidemics, routine care, etc."
