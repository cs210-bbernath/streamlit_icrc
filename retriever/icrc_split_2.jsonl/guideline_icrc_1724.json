"Patients for their part limit their intake to their ability to drink. # Differentiated diagnosis of dehydration and septic shock\nDehydration is easily confused (or associated) with septic shock. However, experience with severely malnourished subjects in famines shows that septic shock is much less common than dehydration. Nevertheless, every case of severe dehydration should suggest septic shock. The disorder must hence be identifi ed, but the differentiated diagnosis poses a sensitive problem:\n9 the signs of shock overlap signifi cantly with those of dehydration; 9 the typical signs of dehydration are misleading in the severely malnourished because sunken eyes, skin inelasticity, dryness of the mouth, and the absence of tears may all be due to malnutrition (Briend, 1997); 9 the typical signs of infection (fever, infl ammation) are attenuated in the severely malnourished. It is tempting to recommend that dehydration and septic shock be treated systematically when dehydration is suspected, in order to avoid unnecessary risk. However, the excessive use of antibiotics should be avoided, and antibiotic treatment is recommended here only in case of kwashiorkor; 20 in such cases therefore, failure to diagnose septic shock upon admission is less serious. In case of marasmus on the other hand, it is best to avoid the use of antibiotics, and the ability to distinguish between simple dehydration and septic shock is therefore essential. The diffi cult task of differentiated diagnosis can be overwhelming for health staff that lacks practical experience in severe malnutrition, especially at a time when not a moment may be wasted. In doubt it is therefore best to treat both dehydration and septic shock. It is worth noting that this combined treatment has no harmful consequences early in initial treatment, but may have after a couple of days when recovery is underway; at that stage however, errors in diagnosis are less likely, because the risks of dehydration should have been mastered by then. # Incipient or developed septic shock 21\nAs a complication of severe malnutrition, septic shock is rare when malnutrition is mainly primary, and prevailing hygiene conditions and access to water remain adequate. It is however common when malnutrition is secondary, associated with seasonal climatic variations and particular individual vulnerability. Septic shock results from serious infection of the digestive, respiratory and urinary tracts, where the toxins released by bacteria stimulate the secretion of endogenous factors; the latter cause small arteries (arterioles) and veins to swell, and interfere with the metabolic pathways. Consequently blood fl ow does not diminish as such, but becomes insuffi cient because the capacity of the vascular system increases -this produces all the signs typical of poor blood fl ow . 20 See Section 4.1.5 in this Chapter."
