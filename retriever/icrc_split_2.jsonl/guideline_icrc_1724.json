"too late to do anything but deplore the resulting malnutrition. In such circumstances, rations that have been set in order to satisfy physiological needs cannot do so -the defi cit being determined by what had to be exchanged -and malnutrition will be proportional to the destitution of the victims. This leads to the fundamental paradox in which the more destitute and hungry people are, the more food aid they need to devote to non-nutritional purposes if food is their only resource. As a result, the utilization of food as an exchange commodity should only be planned as a last resort, when no alternative exists, or when this is the only way of opening access to essential goods and services."
