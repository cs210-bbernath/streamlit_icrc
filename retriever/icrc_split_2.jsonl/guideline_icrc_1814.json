"# Attendance monitoring\nThis monitoring is of utmost importance in ensuring appropriate benefi ciary feeding. When meals are eaten within the centre, it is done during each meal, in a register indicating bracelet number and benefi ciary name. The latter and accompanying relatives must be informed of meal, distribution and healthcare attendance rules. Absences on more than three consecutive occasions, or more than fi ve days in two weeks, without proper reason, will exclude the benefi ciary from the programme. Obviously, patience is called for just as much as strictness; the reasons for absence must be understood and solutions offered."
