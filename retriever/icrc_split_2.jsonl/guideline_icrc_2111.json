"9 Each session should conclude with its evaluation. 9 Key messages should be identical for all. 9 Regular sessions should be organized for the audience to share its experiences and suggest improvements or changes -endorsement by the audience is the only guarantee of success. 9 Training staff should follow trainees closely until the delivered instructions are spontaneously applied in practice. 9 Programme indicators should refl ect expected behavioural change clearly; in crisis, indicators should relate to the reduction of the incidence and seriousness of sickness, rather than to growth performance and nutritional status, which cannot improve dramatically in highly precarious living conditions. Nutritional information programmes may need to be accompanied by similar efforts in the fi elds of water and habitat, domestic healthcare, and the timely referral to available healthcare services. # Practical aspects\n\n# Planning and organizing sessions\nOnce the problems and key messages have been determined, the programme is planned in a sequence of sessions that address one problem at a time, proceeding from the simplest to the more complex."
