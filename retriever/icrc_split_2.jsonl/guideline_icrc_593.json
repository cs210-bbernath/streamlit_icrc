"They can be subdivided as follows:  \n\n# The Economic Environment\nAn emergency situation should not be the cue to embark on a macroeconomic analysis of the country involved; at most, the country's economic profile may be sketched. A number of indicators can be used for this purpose which reflect the country's degree of dependence on the international economic environment. 3 On the local level, however, a microeconomic analysis of the mechanisms of access to food resources may be useful. # The Social Environment\nDietary practices, the use of health services, and the physical environment all depend largely on the social context. These elements must be considered when the moment comes to choose the form that emergency relief will take. Social indicators, rarely quantified, are difficult to analyze, but remain relevant in an emergency situation. # The Political Environment\nIn conflict situations, it is essential to consider indicators reflecting the political situation. Some political decisions have direct consequences for the victims' health status -for example, in the case of forced population displacements, or restrictions on access to food or medical services. Having defined the type and number of indicators required, the epidemiologist must determine where the necessary data can be found. # Sources of Information\nDepending on the information sought, several sources are possible:\n\n# The Population\nDuring the initial assessment, when the health services are not yet in a position to furnish precise data, the population itself is the only possible source of information. For the purposes of a surveillance system, however, it is still preferable to seek facts from the health services rather than the population, except in the case of research specifically concerning the latter. # The Administrative Services\nThe national ministries 4 and administrative services are good sources for socioeconomic and cultural data, censuses of the local population, etc. # The Community Health Services\nMany health ministries run programs specifically oriented towards a particular problem, such as immunization, malaria control, diarrheal disease control, or tuberculosis control. Information can be obtained not only on the characteristics of the country, but also on the policy followed in the areas mentioned above."
