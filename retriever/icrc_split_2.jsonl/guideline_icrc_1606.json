"If benefi ciaries cannot be identifi ed individually by registration and nominal summoning, they must at least be identifi ed according to the kitchen that serves them. Certainly the best option involves the use of bracelets that indicate the kitchen reference number and the benefi ciary's identifi cation code -this option is in any case preferable to the use of distribution cards. Ledgers must also be used and kept up to date: they are necessary to keep track of the number of benefi ciaries and are thus important in the logistics chain, and they provide the number of admissions and their registration codes per date, which enables the evaluation of impact. Moreover, ledgers permit the identifi cation of subjects who require special attention, such as patients undergoing medical treatment."
