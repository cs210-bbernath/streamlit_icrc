"discussed in detail in Chapter 3 (''Water and Environmental Hygiene''). To review, the basic elements of controlling contamination are:\n-a supply of clean water; -waste disposal; -personal hygiene (preventing the contamination of food and hands with fecal matter). \n# Reinforcing Immunity\nSeveral vaccines are being developed 75 for diarrheal diseases caused by shigella, E. coli, and rotaviruses. However, they have not yet proved effective. Every individual has a certain threshold of tolerance for pathogens, which depends on the immunity acquired against the particular germ and the infectious dose specific to each germ. 76 This is why a low level of contamination can be tolerated in water considered potable."
