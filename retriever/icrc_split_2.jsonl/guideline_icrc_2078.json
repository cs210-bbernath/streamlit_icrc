"of substituting maternal milk with artifi cial alternatives if feasible. This poses a serious problem for humanitarian action, which often deals with groups that face increased health problems in all fi elds, and cannot be treated individually (unless they are gathered in camps). Ultimately, the theoretical answer to mother-to-child HIV transmission through breastfeeding is to supply HIV-positive mothers with appropriate maternal milk substitutes, and the means to prepare them in line with the hygiene standards discussed earlier. The remaining question is then one of feasibility, which is determined by the possibility of:\n9 detecting AIDS cases among pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, without stigmatizing them; 9 obtaining appropriate maternal milk substitutes; 9 ensuring the safe preparation and administration of such substitutes in a durable way; 9 ensuring that other agencies shall indeed follow the cases of these mothers and their children after the completion of the humanitarian operation proper."
