"accentuate oedema (this is referred to as high-output cardiac failure). Cardiac failure can occur at any moment and cause acute circulation failure, and death. Clinical signs include oedemas (usually in the legs, but sometimes on the face and chest); patients present palpitations, shortness of breath, an accelerated pulse, and neck vein swelling with visible pulsations. Diastolic arterial pressure diminishes, and systolic pressure increases proportionately. Patients may complain of leg pains following mild effort such as walking. While blood circulation still functions properly, the extremities feel hot because of vasodilatation. The urine volume diminishes, but without an increase in urinary albumin excretion (albuminuria), enabling diagnosis orientation."
