Hunger in this sense refers to classic situations of famine, which deprive groups of their access to food because of extreme destitution and/or insuffi cient food availability (whatever the group's resources to secure it); the expression also applies to situations in which displaced persons or refugees depend exclusively on external assistance. In such cases, GFD amounts to survival relief, and aims at:\nensuring adequate food access, through the provision of food where the primary role of that food is to provide nutrients."
