"Fellowship (INF) started assisting the Green Pastures Hospital in Pokhara. The institution extended its support to the Yerahity Rehabilitation Centre run by the Nepal Army in Kathmandu in 2009. These rehabilitation centres are provided with nancial assistance, supplies, equipment and the consumables for fabricating arti cial limbs. The ICRC also sponsors Nepali students to attend the formal three-year training course at the Cambodian School of Prosthetics and Orthotics in Phnom Penh. To enrich their professional experience, the institution organised clinical placements for physiotherapists and prosthetic/orthotic technicians in rehabilitation centres assisted by the ICRC in Cambodia. In order to improve access to physical rehabilitation services in Nepal, the ICRC introduced a low-cost polypropylene technology for fabricating arti cial limbs at both of the rehabilitation centres that it supports."
