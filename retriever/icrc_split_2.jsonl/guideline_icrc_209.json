"radically change the relations between a population and its environment. Such situations involve two essential factors: changes in the environment, and population concentrations. Environmental changes may be radical. This is the case, for example, when displaced populations or refugees arrive in a new environment, or when a people's movements within its normal geographical environment are restricted. Such restrictions are usually the result of military operations: landmines placed on the roads, for example, tend to reduce access to the usual natural resources, such as water. Environmental changes usually go together with population movements. Conflict situations are often characterized by population concentrations as people are forced to leave their homes because of dangerous conditions and/or political reasons."
