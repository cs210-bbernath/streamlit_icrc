"Diversity and hierarchy of actors concerned by the ICRC's different modes of action 5 Guideline 2.5. Any health system may be represented by a health pyramid; the number of levels in the pyramid and the authorities concerned may vary from one country to another. Specialized health facilities are at the apex of the pyramid, while the general health services, including primary health care (PHC), are at the base. The strategy of using MHUs for vaccination, for example, is also at the base. MHUs do not belong only to the area of primary health services; they may also represent more specialized levels of health care such as clinics performing ophthalmological surgery. # | THE HEALTH PYRAMID -\nThe most basic health facilities (health posts here, but in some countries these may be health centres or consultations given by a general practitioner) are responsible for all or part of the PHC spectrum. PHC represents a whole range of activities and services which may be divided into several categories: food security, water and sanitation, health promotion, preventive activities, curative services, rehabilitation, and also social assistance. assurance\nThe entire PHC spectrum is an ideal to be pursued. The conditions in which the ICRC works arise from armed conflict, which is a restrictive factor for the provision of all the PHC services required."
