"assistance in the areas of management and coordination, for example. It presupposes a relationship of trust with the authorities, the cooperation of those authorities, and previous agreement on the objectives to be achieved and the appropriate time frame. \n# Substitution: direct provision of assistance in place of ineffectual authorities\nIt often happens in situations of armed conflict or internal violence that the authorities lack the means or the will to meet the humanitarian needs in their countries. It sometimes happens that there are not, or no longer, any authorities at all. In such cases the ICRC has to consider meeting needs in a direct manner; its activities then consist in providing assistance directly to the victims."
