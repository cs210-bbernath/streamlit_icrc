"# Return to Peace\nPeace may be reestablished in various ways. The test of strength between the two parties to the conflict may end in the victory of one of them. Negotiations between the two, with or without an intermediary, may resolve the situation. Peace may be reestablished by these negotiations or by the pressure of international diplomacy. Finally, it may result from outside intervention by one or several countries acting under the mandate or with the authorization of the UN Security Council. In such a case, the armed forces under the control of the UN act in accordance with Article 42 of the UN Charter. The UN also plays a predominant role in peacekeeping operations, by installing observers, deploying armed forces, or else establishing civilian personnel in the areas concerned. A return to lasting peace depends not only on the cessation of hostilities, but especially on a recognition of the causes that led to the conflict. In noninternational conflicts, the solution is usually political, and the UN plays a primary role: it provides for immediate measures ranging from the provision of aid to the holding of free elections, to the placement of a country under administrative supervision. In the longer term, maintenance of a lasting peace will involve socioeconomic change."
