"delay in the administration of thiamine (which is not toxic). Recommended doses vary according to sources:\n9 injection of 10 to 20 mg/day and then, following improvement, 10 mg/day orally (Latham, 1979); 9 intramuscular injection of 25 mg twice daily during 3 days, and then 10 mg orally twice or three times daily until convalescence (Davidson et al., 1979); 9 intravenous or intramuscular injection of 50 to 100 mg per day during 7 to 14 days, and then 10 mg/day orally until full recovery (Shils et al., 1994). The recovery from wet beriberi following thiamine administration is spectacular: within hours, the clinical signs subside, and patients are instantly relieved."
