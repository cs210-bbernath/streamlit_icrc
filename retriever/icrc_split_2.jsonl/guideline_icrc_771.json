"This implies that the exact skills of the health-care personnel at each level are known, including those of any community health workers. 17 Delegating standardized tasks on the basis of skills is an essential integrational activity at the beginning of an intervention. This, of course, can be done only if diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and criteria for inter-level transfer have been rationalized, standardized, and well-formulated in advance. # Integration of the Preventive and Curative Levels\nPrimarily curative activities are unlikely to influence the health status of a disaster-stricken population. They will save a certain number of victims, of course, and the media will have the opportunity to present dramatic features about ''the fantastic work done by medical teams working under horrifying conditions''; but, overall, the health situation will not change much. On the other hand, an exclusively preventive approach will run up against incomprehension on the part of the victims -who will not understand why no one is taking care of their sick -and on the part of the media, who will immediately interpret this policy as a criminal failure to render assistance to people in danger. Integration between preventive and curative measures is technically necessary and politically desirable. The value of curative care is unquestionable. Nonetheless, curative measures are merely a palliative for the medical problems most frequently encountered in disaster situations. They improve individual cases to some extent, but do not provide reasonable solutions in the medium term."
