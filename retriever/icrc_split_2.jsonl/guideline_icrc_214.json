"a given population can be provided with two water systems. In most emergency situations, this idea is unrealistic, both logistically and in terms of people's ability to use two networks simultaneously. 5 Thus, ''water needs'' means an individual's overall needs. It is tempting to define quantitative norms applicable at all times and in all places, but the reality is completely different: in determining water needs we must take into account physiological, cultural, geographic, and technical factors. Physiological norms alone indicate that the minimal quantity of water to permit survival would be about 3 liters per person per day in temperate zones, and 6-10 liters in hot climates."
