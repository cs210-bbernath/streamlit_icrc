"The quantity varies from one germ to the next. 11 Water Quantity\nThe more water people have at their disposal, the greater their ability to maintain standards of hygiene. In practice, this means washing themselves, washing clothes, washing vegetables, and so on. In terms of morbidity, these habits will translate into a reduction in the incidence of water-washed diseases, namely:\n\n# Classification of Communicable Diseases by Their Relation to Water\n- consumption of polluted water: -cholera -amebiasis \n\n# Interaction of Factors\nTo grasp the extent to which the different factors are intertwined, we need only consider the potential impact of the two factors just described, water quantity and quality. Many studies have been carried out to determine the respective importance of each factor in health status, and particularly in the incidence of diarrheal illnesses. The general consensus is that the quantity of water takes precedence over the quality:\n''The impact of water supply and sanitation on diarrhoea, related infections, nutritional status, and mortality is analysed by reviewing 67 studies from 28 countries. The mean reductions in diarrhoea morbidity rates are 22% from all studies and 27% from a few better-designed studies. All studies of the impact on total mortality rates show a median reduction of 21%, while the few better-designed studies give a median reduction of 30%. Improvements in water quality have less of an impact than improvements in water availability or excreta disposal.'' 13\nAlthough quantity is essential, the quality of the water must not, of course, be neglected; it should correspond to the norms defined above. From a practical point of view, if it is necessary to choose between supplying small quantities of pure water or large quantities of water containing a few coli bacilli, then the latter option is preferable. # Malnutrition\nThe impact of water supply on nutritional status shows quite clearly that water quantity and quality are closely linked."
