"if the child is taller, then it is severely wasted. q Conversely, the child's MUAC value should be located above the child's height on the left-hand scale -if this is the case, the child is not wasted. If the MUAC value is indicated below the child's actual height, then the child is wasted, and its values must be sought on the right-hand scale accordingly. If the child's MUAC value is indicated above its height, it is moderately wasted; if the child's MUAC is indicated below its height, it is severely malnourished. Thus, the QUAC stick method is an easy and fast way of distributing children into three nutritional status groups: good nutritional status, moderate wasting, and severe wasting."
