"infl uences energy expenditures (and, hence, energy requirements) signifi cantly. The basal metabolism is multiplied to calculate energy requirements according to the level of physical activity. WHO proposes the use of the following multiplication factors for calculating average daily energy requirements according to physical activity (WHO, 1985): Ambient temperature Ambient temperature infl uences energy requirements 14 substantially. The lower the temperature, the higher the energy cost of thermo-genesis. It goes without saying that rations should not be automatically increased in harsh climatic conditions: habitat material must be supplied fi rst in order to protect their recipients against the cold (shelter against rain or snow and wind, heating material, etc.), and clothing and blankets for thermal comfort."
