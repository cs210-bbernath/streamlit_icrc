"facilities are unable to meet the needs of the population. What should be done? Stick to the principle of proportionality? Help each side equally? Assist according to need and publish ''good conduct'' reports for the party that meets its responsibilities? There should be no deviation from the true meaning of the principle of proportionality, which is to grant humanitarian aid proportionally to the needs of the victims. \n# Strategy and Prevention\nAll problems have causes; relief teams must be aware of possible ways of preventing those causes. \n# Technical Prevention of the Immediate Causes of Medical Problems\nThe principle of preventing medical problems (instead of waiting for them to appear and then treating them) is now accepted by all the major humanitarian agencies."
