"Consequently, taking disasters into account in national development programs may seem paradoxical insofar as poverty and inequality are becoming increasingly manifest. The International Decade has served as a basis for changing national mentalities, allowing leaders to draw support from international recommendations in order to change their approach to disaster situations:\n\n# International Legislation\n''The advent of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) changed that, providing practitioners at the national level with the international credentials they lacked. Gradually, the Decade has weeded out those practitioners -amateurs and professionals -who have failed to master new methods and techniques, or who cling to the old way of equating disaster prevention and mitigation with stockpiling equipment, blankets, and old clothing.'' 62 The need to integrate disaster prevention in a global policy based on human development is regularly emphasized in international seminars, such as the round table organized in Berlin on the subject of ''Disaster Mitigation and Prevention Policies for Sustainable Development'' (25-28 January 1994), which concluded in its final declaration: ''National and international agencies responsible for development planning should play the leading role in the promotion and implementation of developmental activities aiming to reduce vulnerability to disasters.''\nThese two basic principles -the integration of disaster prevention in a global development policy and the States' primary responsibility in both devising prevention programs and managing response -have challenged the role of international humanitarian agencies, which had a tendency to monopolize disaster interventions without concerning themselves with local response capacities or possibilities of prevention, the starting point for any development process. Countries in Latin America and Asia have demonstrated their ability to confront their responsibilities in both disaster response and disaster prevention; whereas others, notably in Africa, are inexorably plunging deeper into the downward spiral of poverty."
