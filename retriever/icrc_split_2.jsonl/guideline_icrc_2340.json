"than on giving artifi cial milk to those vulnerable children. \n# MIXED DIET\nIt is now recognized that to prevent malnutrition it is necessary to get enough energy (calories). If a person can eat enough of a mixed diet to satisfy his energy requirements he will automatically be satisfying his protein requirements. This is true for growing children as well as for adults. Milk being a liquid (nearly 90% water) is a very dilute source of energy and a baby after the fi rst 4-6 months of life cannot satisfy his energy requirements from milk alone, but needs solids which are a more concentrated source of energy."
