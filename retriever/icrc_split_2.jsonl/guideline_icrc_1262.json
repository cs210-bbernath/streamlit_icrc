"Assessment tools\n\n# ASSESSMENT TOOLS\nThe use of appropriate tools improves the quality of assessment results. Some tools, such as analytical grids, mapping and ranking, have two specifi c advantages in addition to serving their direct purpose: their design itself involves thought and analysis, and is a simple and effi cient manner of developing discussion and the exchange of views. The use of such tools may be illustrated by referring to the summary of data to be collected during the preliminary appraisal discussed earlier, 19 and by providing examples of tools that could be useful in doing so."
