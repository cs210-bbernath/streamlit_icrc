"# Assessment\nThis consists in verifying the rate of nutritional recovery, the duration of stay (related to the recovery rate), the speed of recovery from sickness and the discharge or exit rate versus recovery (objective met), death, drop-out, absenteeism, and transfer to therapeutic feeding centres or hospitals. In other words:\n9 the nutritional recovery rate should be at least 5 g/kg/day, provided the ration is enriched in vitamins and minerals as described in Annex 16; 9 the duration of stay should not exceed two months; 9 the recovery rate should be no less than 80%; 9 the death rate should be lower than 5% among benefi ciaries whose meal and healthcare attendance rate has been above 90%; 9 the dropout rate should be lower than 15%, but dropping out is not necessarily a refl ection on the quality of the centre; 9 the transfer rate to therapeutic feeding centres should be less than 3% for benefi ciaries in good health; 9 the transfer rate to hospitals depends upon the living conditions outside the centre, and it is thus impossible to set an arbitrary standard. Of course, the above factors are interrelated and must be interpreted as such."
