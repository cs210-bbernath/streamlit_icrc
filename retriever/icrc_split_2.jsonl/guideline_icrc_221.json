"This criterion covers all the work necessary to make the source usable. Usually a combination of measures is required: extraction of ground water, treatment of surface water, establishment of a water carrier and distribution network, etc. The engineering aspect influences both the cost of the project and the time needed to implement it. The latter is crucial in emergency situations, when safe water must be obtained quickly."
