"guide: . 0-10 faecal coliforms/100 ml = reasonable quality . 10-100 faecal coliforms/100 ml = polluted \n\n# Chemical Quality\nThe presence of toxic substances (arsenic, mercury, lead, nitrates, etc.) or abnormally high levels of trace elements (such as fluoride) in the water poses a risk to the health of the people who consume it. Eliminating such substances requires complex, costly technical measures which are difficult to implement under normal circumstances, and practically impossible during an emergency. An elevated concentration of salts (chlorides, sulfates) leads to few health problems, since beyond a certain level the water's salty taste deters people from drinking it."
