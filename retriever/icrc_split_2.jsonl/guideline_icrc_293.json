"This is actually much more complex than it might at first seem. The evaluator must consider:\n-the validity of the indicators chosen. For example, is the incidence of diarrheal diseases indicative of the impact of a sanitation program? -the reliability of the information sources used. Not everyone may have the same definition of diarrhea.. -the incidence of all the variables -for instance, the importance of improved water, of latrine use, of education, etc., in reducing diarrheal diseases within a given population. All these factors are routine elements of a surveillance program, which will be studied in Chapter 6 (''Epidemiology'')."
