"and protein content of the resulting ration is slightly different. On the other hand, amounts should be adjusted if observation indicates that the factors determining the ration are different from those used in designing the reference ration. For example, if recipient groups must rebuild their habitat and tend to their crops manually, the cereal ration should be increased by 100 g per person per day in order to compensate for the additional physical effort. As mentioned earlier, it may be necessary to distribute full rations that ensure mere survival. This option has proven successful in the distribution of meals in Somalia and Angola."
