"43 This is the minimal capacity; in reality, an additional capacity of 10 beds is advisable to cover fluctuations in the number of admissions. Certain constraints common to emergency situations should be kept in mind, however:\n& Sometimes, at the beginning of an emergency situation, the need for beds is far in excess of the figures given above. This is no reason, however, to begin constructing large hospitals, since normally demand will soon be reined in by the preventive measures taken, to fall back within the margin of the estimates previously calculated. & The total population can vary rapidly. It is not unusual for the number of refugees to rise in no time from 10,000 to 20,000. Plans for health-care facilities must take into account possible developments in the political situation, even though this usually involves considerable speculation. # Allocation of Responsibilities\nThe Family\nIn a camp, at least at the beginning, it is difficult to organize family medicine cabinets; later on, the idea can be considered, but any drugs distributed in this way are very likely to be sold to offset the displaced people's lack of financial resources. Moreover, if secondary-level health facilities (dispensaries, healthcare centers) are readily accessible, there is little sense in handing drugs over to the family. # The Community\nIn a camp enjoying the services of trained CHWs, a framework should be created for them; where there are none, training CHWs is a priority in order to cover basic medical problems in a satisfactory manner. At the same time, facilities should be planned for them to work in. # The Dispensary\nIf the number of displaced people is not too large, an effort should be made to find local facilities, if possible, that can meet the needs of the new population. The establishment of a network of dispensaries within large camps is essential. # The Hospital\nBuilding a hospital is justified only for large concentrations of people. In general, camp hospitals are flimsy structures able to accommodate only those cases that do not require very extended or complex hospital care. For those who do not fall into this category, a solution must be found in a local hospital."
