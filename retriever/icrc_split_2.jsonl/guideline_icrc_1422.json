"However, because food aid programmes are so diffi cult to implement, cereals are frequently distributed alone and this increases the risk of specifi c defi ciencies. 10 A maize-based diet induces pellagra, but also beriberi in the case of industrially processed, low extraction fl our; a diet based on polished rice also results in beriberi. Pellagra and beriberi are specifi c defi ciencies that can cause much damage in crisis situations. The simple distribution of legumes with cereals, in adequate proportions, avoids such epidemics."
