"31 Antipyretics should be given to patients whose body temperature exceeds 39.5\u00b0C. # Parasite infections\nProtozoa and nematodes account for most parasite infections in a TFC. # Protozoa\nThe commonest protozoa infections are amoebiasis (Entamoeba Hystolitica) and giardiasis (or lambliasis, Giardia Lamblia). In the absence of laboratory facilities to analyse stool and if dysentery persists in spite of antibiotic treatment, amoebiasis or giardiasis should be suspected -both are treated orally with metronidazole, as per the posology provided in Table 13.9 below. # Nematodes\nNematodes include intestinal roundworms (ascaris, Ascaris Lumbricoides), hookworms (ankylostomes, Ancylostoma Duodenale or Necator Americanus), and pinworms (oxyures, Enterobius Vermicularis). Nematode infection is so common that it should be treated systematically."
