"it does not cause spectacular symptoms, and is rarely fatal. It arises mainly from an iron defi ciency within the organism, but can also arise from dietary folic acid defi ciency (its second most important cause), or defi ciency in vitamin B 12 and protein. Vitamin A, C, E, B 6 (pyridoxine), and copper defi ciency also contribute to anaemia. In developing countries, the average prevalence of anaemia caused by iron defi ciency among women of childbearing age is approximately 40%, against 12 to 18% in industrialized countries. Whatever its cause, anaemia indicates that haemoglobin levels in the blood are too low for the organism to function adequately."
