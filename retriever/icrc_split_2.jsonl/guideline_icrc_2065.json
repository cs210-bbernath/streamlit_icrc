"Septic shock is mainly treated by administering broad-spectrum antibiotics as soon as its is diagnosed. The recommended fi rst-line treatment is the following (WHO, 1999):\n9 Ampicillin: 50 mg/kg every 6 hours for 2 days, followed by amoxicillin, 15 mg/kg every 8 hours for 5 days (if amoxicillin is unavailable, ampicillin can be given -25 mg/kg every 6 hours). In combination with:\n9 Gentamicin: 7.5 mg/kg once daily for 7 days. The second-line treatment follows if the patient fails to respond, if improvement is weak, or if meningitis is suspected. First-line treatment should show results within two days; if it does not, chloramphenicol should be added to fi rst-line treatment (25 mg/kg every 8 hours -every 6 hours if meningitis is suspected -for 5 days) (WHO, 1999). By then, the patient should show appetite and begin to gain weight. If not, second-line treatment must be started and fi rst-line treatment must be extended to a total of 10 days; if no progress is noted by then, other complications such as AIDS and/or tuberculosis must be investigated. Clearly, any other treatment required by other specifi c infections must be given also."
