"Comparing raw data is useless; they can only be compared as rates or percentages (same denominator). # Relative Risk\nRelative risk is a useful concept in analysis, since it is the ratio between the rates of a variable measured in two populations, in one of which the variable presents a risk. For example, in area A, the incidence of diarrheal diseases in children under the age of five is 12%, while it is 4% in area B. The relative risk is the relation between the two rates; in this case, population A has three times the probability of diarrheal diseases as population B. If the relative risk is close to 1, there is essentially no difference between the two populations."
