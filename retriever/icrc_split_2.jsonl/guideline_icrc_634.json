"correct sampling methods is often difficult in an emergency situation. The constraints involved give rise to distortions in the selection of subjects. If the purpose of the survey is to obtain some estimate, even a rough one, of mortality, morbidity, or malnutrition rates, the epidemiologist should take these distortions into account when analyzing the data. \n# Sample Size\nA sample should be as large as possible to reduce sampling errors to the minimum; it should be as small as possible to reduce the investment of operational resources to the minimum. In deciding on the right size for a sample, investigators must respect certain basic principles."
