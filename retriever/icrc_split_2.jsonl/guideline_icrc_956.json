"from a particular ethnic group? There are four options: . Assist the facility, since the aid supplied will be used to treat at least part of the population -although this amounts to accepting discrimination. Negotiate until the facility agrees to accept all patients without discrimination, then assist it -realizing, however, that if the facility refuses, the population will be deprived of necessary care. Assist the facility in spite of everything, and negotiate to obtain access for all. Although a means of pressuring the authorities will thereby be lost, the aid will help at least part of the population. The relief agency offers access to care to one population group, but without accepting the discrimination against the other group."
