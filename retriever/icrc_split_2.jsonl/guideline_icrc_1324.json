"9 10% by social obligations; 9 20% by survival reserves. Such a gap indicates that the available means can only satisfy 70% of the needs, and the shortfall is thus 30%. It also indicates that the behaviour that consists in utilizing survival reserves threatens the household's economic self-suffi ciency. The response to the drought is here both insuffi cient and dangerous, and highlights the serious problems already encountered at the food securing stage, which will have consequences later in the feeding process. It is worth noting that behavioural gaps are observed in terms of the type of production activity and of the utilization of available resources, but also in terms of the time devoted to the different production activities."
