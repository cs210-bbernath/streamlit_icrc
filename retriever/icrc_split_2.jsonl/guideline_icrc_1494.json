"the interpretation of results; weight is not always easily measured. \n# Conventional cut-off points and classifi cation:\n9 > 90%: normal nutritional status 9 90 to 75%: mild malnutrition (fi rst degree) 9 < 75 to 61%: moderate malnutrition (second degree) 9 < 60%:\nsevere malnutrition (third degree). \n\n# MUAC-for-height\nAdvantages: a very good indicator of wasting; it provides a more accurate refl ection of the real nutritional reserves of the organism than weight (which explains its stronger correlation with mortality than with weight). According to circumstances and concurrent infection, overall weight loss is frequently proportionately lower than lean mass and adipose tissue loss (parasite infection, and sub-clinical infl ammation and oedema)."
