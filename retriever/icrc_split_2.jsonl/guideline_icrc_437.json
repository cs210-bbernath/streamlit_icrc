"of infection (subjects with positive sputum) in the population concerned. This rate is estimated to be 1-6% 92 in developing countries. On this basis, the presumption is that each time the annual rate of infection increases by 1%, incidence increases by 50/100,000 per year. 93 Thus, for a rate of 3%, incidence will be 150/100,000, and prevalence 300/100,000; for a rate of 6%, incidence will be 300/100,000 and prevalence 600/ 100,000; and so on. The living conditions of displaced populations probably predispose them to an increased annual risk of infection, mainly because of poor nutritional status, overcrowding, and the many infectious sources (subjects positive for the disease who have had no access to health-care services for a long time)."
