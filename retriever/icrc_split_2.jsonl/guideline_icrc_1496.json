"a 1-year-old infant, and to 78% in a 5-year-old child. Drawbacks: it requires two measurements, one of which is not easy to take, and the participation of two persons. Practical improvements: the choice of two cut-off points with respect to the reference permits the construction of a height board that combines height and arm circumference and subjects may then be included in one of three categories of nutritional status: acceptable nutritional status, moderate malnutrition, and severe malnutrition. The method presents the advantage of removing the need for accurate height measurement, which saves time, human resources (two persons are no longer required), and calculations."
