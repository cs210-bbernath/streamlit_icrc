"48 ''In the most typical case, a peasant may travel to a neighbouring or distant country which is untouched or only lightly affected by drought and famine to borrow food from a relative, a friend, or someone with whom such an arrangement can be made. The earlier intervention in the chain of vulnerability takes place, the greater the chances that serious food and nutritional crises can be avoided. This raises the whole problem of humanitarian strategy in the field of famine relief. In the first place, although the onset of serious food crises can be predicted, usually it is not until the media become interested that the authorities concerned -local, national, and international -go into action. The second difficulty is that sending food aid in a crisis does not solve the underlying problem. Its roots often lie in preexisting underdevelopment; the current crisis, latching onto it, only emphasizes economic, sociocultural, and political structural inadequacies. The benevolent approach of food aid which has predominated up to now should be completely revised in favor of a preventive approach designed to correct structural inadequacies. 49 At a certain point, it becomes difficult to tell whether the activities undertaken -development if they attack the root of the problem, emergency relief if they attack the consequences -derive from one strategy or the other. Food aid to a population whose food resources, according to predictions, will not meet their normal needs within six months, is still an emergency measure; agricultural aid in the form of distribution of seeds, tools, and draft animals, in contrast, is a rehabilitation measure. Finally, improving the management of the water used for agriculture and changing farming techniques come under the heading of development rather than rehabilitation. To classify different activities objectively according to whether they constitute emergency aid, rehabilitation, or development, the following criteria are used:\n\n# Who decides? # Who implements?"
