"that can be controlled will be diffi cult to deliver. Only practical and conclusive experimentation can infl uence beliefs. This requires time and means, which humanitarian agencies sometimes lack, especially in overt crisis. Finally, the more risky the medium, the greater the need to apply strict hygiene standards -the degree of risk is defi ned by the quality of the water, access to safe water, disposal of waste water and garbage, habitat, vector control, and climate (temperature and humidity). Clearly, if the risk of infectious disease results mainly from an insalubrious environment, then water and habitat programmes are the fi rst defence against such risks, rather than lectures on food hygiene, however convincing they may be."
