"The number of stoves is determined by cooking times and amounts, and cauldron capacity. Professional cooking material is often not available; in this case, stoves must be built in a way that optimizes fuel consumption and smoke evacuation. Kitchens must be well-ventilated and equipped with a waste water disposal system."
