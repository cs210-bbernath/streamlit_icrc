"Selected benefi ciaries are admitted into the centre for registration. Targeting all individuals belonging to vulnerable groups no longer makes sense once the general population's access to food has become adequate; the SFP's modalities can then be modifi ed. # Contributing to a more effective response to moderate malnutrition\nOnce preventive measures are in place, SFPs can prove useful in accelerating the reduction of moderate malnutrition. This scenario illustrates what has been discussed in Section 2.1.1.A above, where the same criteria -children under 5 or whose height is inferior to 110 cm, suffering from moderate malnutrition -apply to admission and discharge. Feeding also takes place in an SFP centre, where benefi ciaries have access to adequate healthcare and possibly nutritional information sessions. The selection of benefi ciaries is made as described in Section 2.1.1.A. Furthermore, the public is informed of the active search for cases on the basis of household visits as soon as the SFP centres have the capacity to register new cases and the population is presenting fewer moderately malnourished children. # Providing safety nets\nAn SFP intending to provide a safety net relates to two different situations. In the fi rst, measures are taken to counter malnutrition, especially in terms of guaranteeing regular access to adequate basic food rations. The purpose is then to complement the GFD once moderate malnutrition rates have fallen, but new cases continue to appear owing to new arrivals and/or persistently harsh living conditions (incapacity to deliver adequate healthcare, poor climatic conditions, precarious habitat and general survival). In the second situation, a GFD is uncalled for, but economic living conditions can be precarious, and/or problems can arise in the fi eld of health services, water and habitat, in turn promoting the appearance of scattered malnutrition cases. This scenario again illustrates the comments made in Section 2.1.1.A above on admission and discharge criteria and food distribution methods."
