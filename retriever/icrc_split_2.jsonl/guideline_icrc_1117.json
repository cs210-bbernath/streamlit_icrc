"If the harm exists, its causes must be investigated, that is, what phenomena have combined with what vulnerabilities to produce such harm, and the assessment process continues according to the stages described above. If harm does not exist, then the origin of the warning signal and its meaning should be investigated, in order to decide upon a relevant course of action -this may include, for example, the introduction of surveillance systems with respect to relevant risk factors."
