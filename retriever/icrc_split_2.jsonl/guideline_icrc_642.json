"the framework of a random sample for an infinite population. 27 These prerequisites are based on the following equation: the maximum value of the difference between the mean found in the sample and the true mean corresponds to the degree of precision established for the study. This value, d, is equal to z times the standard error (SE), or\nd = z (x) SE. The standard error is equal to the ratio between the standard deviation (SD) and the square root of the sample size (n), or SE = SD/Hn. Thus, d = z (x) SD/Hn n = z 2 (x) SD 2 d 2 28 This value can be rounded up to 2."
