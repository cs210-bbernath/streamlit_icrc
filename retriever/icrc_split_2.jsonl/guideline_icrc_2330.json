"c to the age bracket between 2 and 6 years. However, from the completion of weaning up until 5 to 6 years, children remain particularly vulnerable to infectious disease such as infant sicknesses, microbial and viral intestinal infections, respiratory infections and parasite infections. As their independence grows, they also receive less continuous attention, and their exposure to infection rises. The birth of a sibling also causes them to lose priority. These factors all increase vulnerability. Children in this age bracket consequently deserve extra watchfulness, in terms of diet, hygiene, and the necessary care (domestic or qualifi ed) if sickness develops."
