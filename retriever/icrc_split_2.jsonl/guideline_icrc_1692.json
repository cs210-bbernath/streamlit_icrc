Recipients may therefore prefer to save this amount by consuming the grains whole, but this entails lengthier cooking, and the necessary fuel then becomes expensive. It would then be reasonable to ask why cereal grains are distributed at all. The answer is that grain travels better, is easier to store and keeps longer."
