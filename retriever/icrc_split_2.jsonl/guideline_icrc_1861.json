Allowing a few drops of milk to dry on the nipple after feeding also protects it against infection and dryness. In this respect, a few drops of maternal milk several times daily applied to minor abrasions and irritated eyes are the best remedy against external infection in neonates. Maternal milk is an excellent antibiotic."
