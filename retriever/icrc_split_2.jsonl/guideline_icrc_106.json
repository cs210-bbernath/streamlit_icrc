"Define the household's expenditures. Step 2 Identify livelihood zones\nLivelihood zones are geographic areas where the majority of households share the same economic dynamic (e.g. agro-pastoralists, cash-crop farmers, etc.). Livelihood zones may overlap with another one (e.g. employees and self-employed persons in a city or pastoral and farming activities in a rural area). Identify the various relevant livelihood zones in a selected area. # Step 3 Identify wealth groups\nWealth groups are groups of households that have similar resources and capacities to exploit various food and income options within a livelihood zone. Identify the key factors that differentiate wealth groups (poor, average, better off ). # Step 4 Understand links to markets and observe market changes\nKnowing what the \"normal\" links between communities and their different markets are helps to understand and predict the available options in times of crisis. During a crisis, observe changes both in the labour market (more or fewer job opportunities, lower or higher wages, etc.) and in prices of key commodities and/or access to them. Identify the rea-\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\nThe household economy son(s) for those changes (conflict and/or damage to infrastructure, etc.). Step 5 Calculate the effect of the shock/hazard\nThe consequences of a shock/hazard on a household in any location will depend on the specific combination of: I the magnitude and nature of the shock/hazard (scale, severity, duration); I the economy of the household; I opportunities to compensate for loss of income; I choices that households make owing to the particular circumstances; I degree of market dependency; I external and environmental factors. It is important to analyse the consequences that a particular shock/hazard, such as insecurity, displacement, drought, floods, etc., can have on a household's ability to access essential needs."
