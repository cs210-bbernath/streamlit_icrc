"Improving the water quality in a TFC involves the use of several methods, which may be combined according to need and available means: sedimentation, fi ltering, and purifi cation. Sedimentation is the process used to purify turbid water. It describes the motion of particles in suspension in response to an external force such as gravity, centrifugal force or electric force."
