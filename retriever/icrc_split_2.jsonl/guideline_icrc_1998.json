"is time-consuming, and thus discourages this practice to some extent. \n# Benefi ciary selection\nThis should occur at the entry point of and outside the centre, after having explained the latter's existence and objectives to the population. Measuring the brachial circumference facilitates the selection of benefi ciaries, who are then admitted into the centre for registration. At the beginning of the programme, the number of admissions should not exceed the centre's daily capacity; it is useless to admit children who cannot receive adequate medical and nutritional care upon arrival. Once the programme is running at full capacity, admissions need to offset discharges."
