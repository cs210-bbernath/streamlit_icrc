"Planning 3. Planning stages 3.2 Setting objectives 9 economic support in order to arrest the impoverishment process in developing crisis (general food distributions combined with nutritional information campaigns where relevant); 9 survival relief when the population's own production is no longer adequate to ensure its self-suffi ciency (general food distributions, therapeutic feeding, combined with supplementary feeding and nutritional information campaigns where relevant); 9 economic rehabilitation, when crisis is about to be resolved (general food distributions combined with nutritional information campaigns where relevant). It is worth reiterating that priorities must be set in a manner that guarantees the consistency of nutritional programmes with others, in line with the priorities illustrated by the health pyramid and overall economic security. In nutrition strictly, the protection of rights and general food distributions are effective at all levels of action in averting a deterioration of the health status, unlike curative nutritional means such as therapeutic and, sometimes, supplementary feeding. If general food distributions are necessary but cannot be implemented, it is useless to resort to another form of nutritional action that is of secondary importance to such distributions in the operational strategy. Logistical or security constraints may involve targeting areas of secondary importance fi rst. At all times, it is necessary to attempt to resolve such constraints in order to return to the primary objectives as dictated by observed needs. Moreover, it is worth noting that the sprinkling of food (as opposed to the systematic distribution of adequate rations) is useless. Priority areas must be selected according to the severity of the problem, or agreements must be reached with recipients regarding the use of available resources until the intended approach may indeed be implemented. # SETTING OBJECTIVES\nSetting objectives amounts to stating clearly what is to be done in order to cover the need for assistance. This consists of the practical translation of general operational objectives: the prevention and alleviation of suffering. Objectives are defi ned in reference to the following points:\n9 the nature of the objective; this includes stating the problem; 9 the benefi ciaries of the operation; 9 the number of benefi ciaries; 9 the location of the operation; 9 the expected results of the operation; 9 the timeframe set to achieve the objectives. This is itself a translation of an overall objective into specifi c objectives. If, for example, the intention is to reduce the prevalence rate of severe malnutrition in pre-school children from 35% to 5%, and severe malnutrition is both primary and secondary, then objectives may be formulated as follows (comments appear in italics). 9 Overall operational objective: q to prevent and alleviate the suffering of the population, estimated at 300,000 persons, located in region X, and experiencing famine. 9 General objective: q to reduce the rate of severe malnutrition among children under 6 years of age from 35% to 5% between 15 July and 30 December; this general objective assumes that children under 6 years of age are most vulnerable to famine, that their malnutrition rate is the indicator of 3.
