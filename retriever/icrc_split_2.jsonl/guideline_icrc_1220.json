"However, validity must always be considered in order, fi rstly, to realize the risk of error that is associated with the indicator and, then, to decide whether, given the circumstances, high sensitivity or high specifi city is preferable. # The expression of indicators\nIndicators can be expressed qualitatively (such-and-such an aspect does or does not exist) or quantitatively (the average wage is X; X millimetre rainfall measured during the last quarter; X individuals suffer from measles; X individuals express a given opinion, etc.). Quantitative data is often expressed in the form of rates, the commonest of which are provided below. # Incidence and relative risk\nThe incidence rate can be described as the number of new cases during a specifi ed period of time as a proportion of a specifi c group at risk. For example, the incidence rate of looting during one month is the ratio between the number of cases reported during that month and the total number of houses in the dwelling, multiplied by one hundred to provide a percentage. A more common example is the ratio between infection arising during a given period and the overall population that is exposed to that risk."
