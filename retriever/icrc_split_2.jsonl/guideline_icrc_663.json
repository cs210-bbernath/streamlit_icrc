"the probability of an erroneous rejection of the null hypothesis. Normally, the null hypothesis is not rejected if the error rate is more than 5%. \n# The t Test\nThe t test is a method of comparing two means, measured from two samples taken from two populations. The starting point is the null hypothesis (no difference between the two populations). It is also possible to formulate this hypothesis by ruling that the means observed come from a single population. In this case, 95% of the means obtained from n-sized samples of that population fall into the interval between +1.96 standard errors relative to the true mean."
