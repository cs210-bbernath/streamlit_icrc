"2. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\n\n# History\nUNHCR was created at the behest of the United Nations General Assembly, and has been protecting refugees since 1 January 1951. # Statute\nThe UNHCR Statute was established by Resolution 428 (V), adopted by the UN General Assembly on 14 December 1950. ''The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, acting under the authority of the General Assembly, shall assume the function of providing international protection, under the auspices of the United Nations, to refugees who fall within the scope of the present Statute and of seeking permanent solutions for the problem of refugees by assisting Governments and, subject to the approval of the Governments concerned, private organizations to facilitate the voluntary repatriation of such refugees, or their assimilation within new national communities.'' 16 The 1951 Convention applies to those people who became refugees as a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951. The Protocol of 1967 Relating to the Status of Refugees eliminated that deadline, extending the protection of UNHCR to people who became refugees after 1 January 1951. # Operation\nThe Executive Committee of UNHCR is composed of 50 States."
