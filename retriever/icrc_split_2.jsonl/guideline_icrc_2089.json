"Following discussions with the population, it may be necessary to include excluded members of the community, the destitute elderly and the sick. It goes without saying that an SFP will be useless if malnutrition is so obvious as to render an enquiry rendundant, and if a GFD cannot be set up rapidly. # NUTRITION MANUAL\nChapter XIV -Supplementary 2. Implementing supplementary 2.1 Intervention modes according feeding programmes feeding programmes to SFP objectives\n\n# Criteria for admission: moderate malnutrition\nModerately malnourished children under 5 years of age are priority candidates. If their age is unknown, the criterion can be set as a height inferior to 110 cms. Moderate malnutrition can be assessed through mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), MUAC-for-height, or weight-for-height. As noted by Briend, mid-upper arm circumference provides a better indicator of mortality risk than weight-for-height (Briend, 1995). 14 Mid-upper arm circumference can be used alone to select benefi ciaries; it is faster but less accurate than MUAC-for-height. Admission thresholds -based on the different indicators -are as follows:\n9 mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC):  12.5 cm; 9 MUAC-for-height expressed as a percentage of the median:  75%; 9 MUAC-for-height expressed in Z-scores:  -3 Z-scores; 9 weight-for-height expressed as a percentage of the median:  70%; 9 weight-for-height expressed in Z-scores:  -3 Z-scores. Children rating less than these inferior thresholds must be referred to a therapeutic feeding centre, unless their health condition is still suffi ciently good for supplementary feeding alone to help their recovery. Moreover, the use of the above criteria must be combined with clinical assessment."
