"principles have been adopted in United Nations resolutions: # I. Moral Code of Humanitarian Organizations Regarding Victims\nThis chapter defines a code of conduct based on experience. The worker in the field must be able to define a practical code of conduct to serve as a guide in the management of his or her activities. To that end, this chapter will review the planning cycle described in Chapter 1, and identify the ethical problems that may arise at each step.   For international humanitarian agencies, the purpose of the initial assessment is to determine whether any problems necessitate outside assistance. Such problems are defined as being the result of an imbalance, actual or potential, between the victims' needs and the capacity of local resources to cope with them."
