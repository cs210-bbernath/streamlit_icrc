"In the example used earlier, an 80 cm boy weighs 8 kg, and the median of the reference weight for his height is 11 kg. The percentage is then as follows:\n\n# Reference population centiles\nCentile numbers refl ect a position within a total of 100. Centile 50 corresponds to the median of the reference population: precisely half of this population shows values that exceed the median, and the other half shows lower values. For example, a measured value corresponding to the tenth centile indicates that the subject's value is equal to or greater than 10% of the individuals within the reference population. However, there is by defi nition no value below the third centile: an index lower than that falls in the general category of malnutrition, and it remains unclear whether it is a severe or moderate case. # Assessment tools 4.4 Nutritional anthropometry\nIn the above example, an 8 kg weight for an 80 cm height is lower than the third centile of the reference population, meaning that the boy is malnourished, but without indication as to whether he is severely or moderately so. # Standard deviation from the median\nStandard deviation 26 is also called Z-score."
