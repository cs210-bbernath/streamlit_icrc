"This encourages planners to examine the relevance of the GFD closely (thus enabling the anticipation and prevention of possible negative effects), and to identify indicators required for monitoring and evaluation beforehand. # SETTING RATIONS TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES AND MEET THE NEED FOR AID\nThe composition of food rations depends on the ultimate objective, according to the two roles ascribed to food: nutritional and economic (in terms of exchange commodity). It is useful to reiterate here that food should only be distributed as an exchange commodity if the necessary essential goods and services cannot be provided directly. In terms of the nutritional role of a GFD, ration composition is determined by whether they only complement the food that recipients can secure independently, or cover their nutritional needs altogether. This approach leads to the defi nition of three different types of ration. 1. Full ration: this type is intended to meet nutritional needs entirely, as is the case in institutions (e.g. prisons, hospitals, orphanages, asylums, and homes for the elderly), camps for refugees or displaced persons, and most famine situations. 2. Complementary ration: this type is intended to complement the food that recipients can still secure independently, either directly or indirectly through their production activities. 3. Economic support ration: this type amounts to a more or less predominant economic exchange commodity, in addition to its nutritional purpose. There is no simple way of setting rations according to these three types owing to the uncertainty surrounding the need for assistance and the manner in which it is distributed; in addition, political, logistical and economic constraints often result in the distribution of minimal, very simple rations. Furthermore, the defi nition of ration types remains highly theoretical because circumstances often call for hybrid compositions -the practical composition of rations is discussed in Section 3.1 below. # DISTRIBUTION METHODS\nDirect distributions involve the delivery of rations to their ultimate recipients by the operating agency itself; in indirect distributions, rations are handed over to the community, which then distributes them to its members. Direct distribution is always best, especially in armed confl ict, in order to ensure that the food does indeed reach its intended benefi ciaries. Misuse and corruption are all too common in the case of indirect distribution, and they are impossible to correct later."
