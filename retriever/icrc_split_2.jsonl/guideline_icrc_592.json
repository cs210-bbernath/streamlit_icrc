"synthesis of data 7. making decisions on the basis of the syntheses\n\n# Concept of Epidemiology\nThe most commonly accepted definition of epidemiology is ''the study of the distribution and determining factors of health problems 1 in the population as a whole and the application of this data to the control of these health problems.''\nThe study of the distribution of health problems is known as descriptive epidemiology, while the study of the causes of health problems is called analytical epidemiology. # Epidemiological Tools\n\n# Definition of an indicator\n\n# Criteria for selecting an indicator 1\nEpidemiology is not limited to the study of epidemics, but encompasses all health problems. # Information on Health Problems\nThe list of information that can be assembled to follow the evolution of an emergency situation is particularly long. It is unrealistic to try to collect all the data possible, since that would require a great deal of time and a large staff, and the sheer volume of the data collected would make analysis difficult. The quest for information is best limited to certain health indicators, chosen for their relevance in describing a given situation or its evolution over time. # Indicators Directly Related to Health Status\nIndicators directly related to health status are the following:\n\n# Mortality\nDisaster situations often involve very high mortality among the victims. Mortality rates are by far the most valuable indicator for measuring the impact of a relief operation. 2\n\n# Morbidity\nMonitoring changes in morbidity allows epidemiologists to determine its main causes, to gauge the impact of preventive measures taken to benefit populations affected by a disaster, to sound the alarm when epidemics threaten, etc. # Nutritional Status\nNutritional status is reflected by the rate of malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. # Indicators Related to the Environment\nOther indicators are related to the environment (in the broad sense)."
