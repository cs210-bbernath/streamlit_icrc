Dehydration occurs in the following stages (Gentilini, 1986): The clinical signs that should suggest incipient or developed septic shock are (WHO, 1999):\n9 signs of dehydration, but without a history of watery diarrhoea; 9 hypothermia or hypoglycaemia; 9 oedema and signs of dehydration. It is worth noting that the combination of several infections can often associate dehydration, due to past diarrhoea episodes, with septic shock."
