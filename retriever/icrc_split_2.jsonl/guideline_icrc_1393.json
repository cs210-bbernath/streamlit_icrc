"At the same time, politicians and donors must engage relevant authorities and armed groups in order to persuade them to change their behaviour. If responsibility is not taken at these two levels, the condemnation of assistance as fuelling crisis is fallacious. If, however, tasks and duties are properly complied with, the quandary is resolved. The corollary of this approach is that dialogue involving all stakeholders in the crisis is a fundamental pre-condition for any humanitarian operation. # The assistance syndrome\nA common opinion holds that GFD, at best, runs counter to motivating its recipients to self-help or, at worst, encourages them to sit back and wait for assistance. Indeed, recipients include GFD in their survival and economic recovery strategies, and not always as anticipated. This does not necessarily indicate the development of an assistance syndrome. The author has in fact never observed such a development -on the contrary, people who need GFD rations for survival and must queue to receive them struggle to retrieve their economic and dietary self-suffi ciency, and their dignity, as soon as possible, in order to escape from a monotonous diet and the humiliation of begging. Recipients must simply be involved from the onset in the choice of implementation and withdrawal criteria; such criteria are shaped by the logic of economic security on the one hand, and by the available means and constraints on the other. Finally, the interest of relevant authorities in prolonging assistance may be viewed as the development of an assistance syndrome among its recipients, when this is in fact not the case. # The sale of rations\nAnother commonly quoted negative effect is the use of food to other ends than those intended, and the deduction by observers that rations exceed actual needs. This may indeed be the case -rations can be overly abundant or unbalanced, and their recipients may in such cases sell the surplus. This indicates mistakes in the defi nition of rations, and amounts to a negative side effect. Usually, however, the sale or exchange of food indicates an optimized utilization of resources available for reconstruction, or forced transaction. If, however, the purpose of selling food rations is to strengthen survival and economic recovery strategies, this should encourage the investigation of more appropriate means of support, for example the provision of vouchers in order to secure the necessary goods and services. The latter must clearly be available, and not be subjected to speculation."
