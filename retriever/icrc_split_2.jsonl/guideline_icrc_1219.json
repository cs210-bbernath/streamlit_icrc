"self-suffi ciency, of engaging in development to mitigate structural weaknesses... Distinguishing emergency from humanitarian action provides a more serene image of humanitarian aid, and invites more accountability towards the victims, especially if it is agreed that prevention is required whenever possible and that food aid programmes should not be stopped under the excuse that malnutrition has been brought back to its pre-crisis levels, but rather because the recipients have resumed their economic self-suffi ciency. This approach eludes the perverse effects associated with emergency, by understanding that it is cheaper to prevent famine than to remedy its consequences. In other words, the key to addressing emergencies lies in prevention."
