"another measurement in order to be compared to reference values. Advantages: a good indicator of wasting; it requires a single, simple measurement and is thus fast; age need not be specifi ed. Drawbacks: the method is less accurate than the QUAC Stick method. \n# Conventional cut-off points and classifi cation:\n9 > 14 or 13.5 cm: satisfactory nutritional status 9 14 or 13.5 to 12.5 cm: moderate malnutrition 9 < 12.5 cm: severe malnutrition. \n\n# Anthropometry in adults\nThe index that is most commonly used for adults is the Body Mass Index (BMI) or Qu\u00e9telet index. This method reveals wasting; the BMI is calculated by dividing weight expressed in kilograms by height (expressed in metres) squared: --------------height 2 (m)\n\n# weight (kg) BMI = -\nBMI is independent of height: if the index is identical for subjects of different heights, then the nutritional reserves of the organism are comparable."
