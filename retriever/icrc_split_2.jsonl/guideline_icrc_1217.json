"As a result, the choice of indicators must rest upon a clear idea of their real signifi cance, both direct and indirect, in order to ensure the appropriate interpretation of assessment results. In case of doubt, their relevance must be checked in terms of the subject and its evolution in order for them to be applied correctly. # General aspects 3.2 Data to be collected of assessment methods\nduring assessment\n\n# The quality of indicators\nClearly, the quality of indicators is determined mainly by their relevance in terms of detecting or documenting the subject of assessment. The quality of indicators is also infl uenced by their ease in use, their variability when handled by different investigators and, sometimes, their acceptability. A major aspect of indicator quality is its validity, which may be expressed mathematically. The validity of an indicator corresponds to its suitability for revealing the object of assessment. Its two components -sensitivity and specifi city -oppose. With respect to a given feature sought within a given population:\n9 indicator sensitivity corresponds to the proportion of cases detected by the indicator as presenting the defi ned feature; 9 indicator specifi city corresponds to the proportion of cases detected by the indicator that do not present the defi ned feature. It is important to understand that indicators are simply a means to approach reality, and thus entail a risk of error. The more sensitive an indicator is, the more cases with the defi ned feature (true positives) it reveals, but at the same time it will reveal more cases to appear that seem to share this feature but in fact do not (false positives). The greater the sensitivity, the lower the ability to select only true positives is. Inversely, the more specifi c an indicator is, the greater its ability to detect cases that are not positive (true negatives), but it also detects more cases that appear not to share the feature when they in fact do (false negatives)."
