"Such behaviour is not abolished in nutritional crisis, and this can have a signifi cant impact on the ultimate use of GFD rations (for example, their exchange for more acceptable or socially necessary commodities). The implementation of GFD must therefore permit the detection and understanding of such behaviours, and allow for them. # The economic dimension of food\nFood must be acquired on a regular basis, be it produced, gathered, hunted, fi shed, or purchased with a means for exchange. As man began to choose particular areas of activity and specialize in them instead of being a self-suffi cient all-rounder, food acquired an economic dimension. At the same time, as discussed in Chapter VI, man increases the range of non-food commodities that he needs for cultural integration. That is, he creates essential material needs of a cultural nature: these include simple objects such as spears, teapots and clothes, and latterly more technically developed items such as laptop computers, telephones, and automobiles. The less self-suffi cient households are in producing all the goods required to satisfy their basic needs, the greater must be their purchasing power to secure the lacking commodities. Purchasing power is provided mainly by money, but food is still a major exchange commodity in many societies, for example those that rely on subsistence agriculture or stock-breeding. Furthermore, the sale of GFD rations can be the main means of securing purchasing power, as often observed in refugee camps and famine situations where food is the only available resource. Humanitarian agencies usually fi nd it diffi cult to accept the economic dimension of food, when recipients do not use donations as planned: in such cases, benefi ciaries are accused of diversion. In fact, in such circumstances, GFD food is inevitably both a source of nutrients and a convertible commodity, and its recipients use it according to their needs and the best yield they might expect from it. 5\n1.6 The broader role of food 1. General considerations 1.7 Negative and side effects of GFD\n\n# The political dimension of food\nFood is a basic commodity that is sometimes diffi cult to secure and, as such, is a major instrument for exchange, confl ict, and power. As a result, food production, stocks and exchanges are often political issues that must be identifi ed and controlled, especially in armed confl ict. The political dimension of food is one of the major constraints of humanitarian assistance. It gives rise to problems of neutrality, power balances, ethics, and security."
