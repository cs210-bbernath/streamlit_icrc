"As a result, the above option will need to be investigated on a case-by-case basis, according to available resources and contextual constraints. Nevertheless, whether or not HIV-positive mothers can be targeted within humanitarian action (which is transient), it is best to continue to promote breastfeeding. The temporary introduction of infant feeding methods that are not sustainable beyond the timeframe of the humanitarian operation is irresponsible; this option leaves mothers, who are already weakened by the threat posed by the sickness, at a complete loss as to how to feed their child. Besides, the HIV-positive prevalence rate may be high in mothers, for example 30%; considering that 30% of the children of HIV-positive mothers risk infection owing to breastfeeding, then 10 children out of 100 are likely to become HIV-positive as a result of breastfeeding -this is low in comparison with the mortality risks associated with maternal milk substitutes. For the time being, until research and practice have produced better tools for analysis and action, it is therefore best to promote breastfeeding and adapt to circumstances."
