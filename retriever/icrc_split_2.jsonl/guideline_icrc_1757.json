"Early in rehabilitation, appetite was good but progress soon stopped, and dietary increases made no difference. The introduction of F-100 Formula in the same locations a few years later on the other hand produced spectacular results, leading to catch-up rates of 15 to 20 g/kg/day as from the fi rst days of treatment, levelling out only when the nutritional status was again satisfactory. # Feeding during rehabilitation\nDuring rehabilitation, the density and quantity of nutrients must be increased, and the diet must begin to diversify in order to re-accustom patients to a normal diet. In principle, the process begins with high-energy milk, subsequently alternates milk with porridge, and ends with normal meals that should be as similar as possible to the patient's after discharge. The progression of the diet is determined by staff resources, the overall workload, and the catch-up rate. The process can be gradual, and involve the supply of F-100 Formula only during the fi rst 5 days, followed by the alternation of F-100 and porridge during another 5 days, and fi nally the replacement of the porridge with normal meals until the completion of rehabilitation. This option is very demanding on kitchen staff and supervisors; it may be eased somewhat by restricting the shifts from one diet to the next to two days per week at most. In more demanding settings, porridge may be alternated with F-100 Formula from the outset, followed by normal meals after one week of rehabilitation. The gradual approach should only be followed in case of mainly secondary malnutrition and signifi cant medical complications. F-100 Formula F-100 Formula differs from F-75 Formula 35 in macro-nutrients and not micro-nutrients. The composition that supplies macro-nutrients is 80 g of skimmed dried milk, 50 g of sugar, and 60 g of oil for the preparation of 1 litre of formula. F-100 Formula supplies 100 kcal (418 kJ) and 2.8 g of protein for 100 ml, for a P/E ratio of 11.2%. Commercial ready-made preparations already contain vitamin and mineral supplements, and they are simply diluted in previously boiled water in compliance with the producer's directions: 190 g of powder are completed up to a fi nal volume of 1 litre (and not 190 g for 1 litre of water). Improvised F-100 Formula F-100 Formula can easily be improvised in compliance with the above indications, and by adding the vitamin-mineral preparation used for F-75 Formula. 36 If only whole dried milk (and not skimmed dried milk) is available, the composition is 120 g of whole dried milk, 30 g of oil, and 40 g of sugar, plus the vitamin-mineral complement to prepare 1 litre of formula -this supplies approximately 100 kcal (418 kJ) and 3 g of protein for 100 ml, with a P/E ratio of 11.6%. If the formula is made from separate ingredients, a pre-mix must be prepared fi rst by blending the milk powder, sugar, and vitamins and minerals homogeneously, and then adding the oil."
