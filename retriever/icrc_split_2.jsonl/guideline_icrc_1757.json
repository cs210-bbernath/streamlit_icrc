"identifying dwellings and their occupants in order to list them. All members of all family units of a given dwelling or defi ned group of dwellings (i.e. clusters) must be present. This method is useful in urban settings, provided that enough teams are working in parallel in order to discourage attempts at abuse. This approach involves three steps. 1. A perimeter is set to include dwellings or clusters within an overall area that is identifi ed according to geographic or political denominators; these dwellings or clusters are then marked with chalk with the help of local civilian authorities. This coding provides an indication of the area or neighbourhood, and the individual dwelling or cluster reference number; it also provides an indication of the number of family units that live in the dwelling or cluster."
