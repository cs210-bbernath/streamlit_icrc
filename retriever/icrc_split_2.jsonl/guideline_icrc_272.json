"Housing and Energy\nAlthough the total or partial destruction of housing is characteristic of natural disasters (earthquakes, floods) and conflicts (bombings, pillaging), the problem of reconstruction will not be discussed here. This section will merely examine ways to provide adequate housing for displaced and refugee populations, taking into account energy and structural requirements. The other factors that help define a population's living conditions (water and sanitation) have already been studied in the previous sections. The uninitiated are apt to assume that the relation between housing and health amounts to nothing more than protection against bad weather. Consequently, providing housing is sometimes considered as a measure to provide comfort, although the link between shelter and health is based on physiological and social needs. # Health Risks\nThe relation between nutritional needs and inadequate housing has been studied in particular by J. Rivers, who writes, ''The fact that famine-affected populations often have reduced amounts of clothing and limited shelter can be very important because of its impact on energy requirements.'' 51\nIn a situation where access to food is problematic, contending with the cold requires an additional caloric intake. 52 Thus, the absence of means of protection from the cold favors the development of malnutrition and increases mortality linked to hypothermia, which itself is fostered by malnutrition. Indirectly, then, ''warming up'' displaced populations by providing them with housing suited to the climate and, if necessary, sources of energy (wood, kerosene) as well makes it possible to reduce the quantity of food required for distribution. 53 The distribution of blankets is more economical than the distribution of a food supplement to cover energy needs generated by chill. Unsuitable housing, such as, for example, the crowding of large numbers of people into collective habitations, causes an increase in certain communicable diseases, as well as psychological stress. An increase in maladies such as tuberculosis, measles, or scabies is directly linked to overcrowding. In addition, the absence of family privacy is a factor in psychological and social tension."
