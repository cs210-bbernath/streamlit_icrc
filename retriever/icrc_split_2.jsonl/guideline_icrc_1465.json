"the woods are not the end, they serve a purpose. Locating edible mushrooms involves some knowledge as to toxicity, and of where, when and how they may be found. This cannot be done effectively by a beginner referring continuously to a textbook, because academic research and fi eld investigation are not simultaneous activities. As a result, a certain minimum knowledge or the presence of an expert is required, or the excursion is fruitless and may even be dangerous. The same comments apply to nutritional surveys: comprehensive nutritional expertise is not necessary, but investigators must know where to fi nd information in case of doubt, and must bear some basic conceptual models in mind."
