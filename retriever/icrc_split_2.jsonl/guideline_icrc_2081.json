"Therefore, feeding should begin as early as possible in the morning and end as late as possible at night. Experience has shown that 5 daily meals between 7:00 am and 5:00 pm yield good results, provided that they are regularly spaced (7:00 am, 9:30 am, 12:00 noon, 2:30 pm, and 5:00 pm) -however, the total number of daily meals should be no less than fi ve. It is usually not possible to distribute amounts that correspond to weight. The same amount must therefore be distributed to everyone, or benefi ciaries must be divided into two or three categories with set amounts for each category:\n9 < 1 year with 300 ml/meal; 9 1-2 years with 400 ml/meal; 9 2 years with 500 ml/meal. During famines, the chosen solution has usually been the systematic distribution of 500 ml/meal to all children, permitting the supervised redistribution of remainders to those who were still hungry or their carers. # NUTRITION MANUAL\n\n# CHAPTER XIV\n\n# SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING PROGRAMMES\n\n# DEFINITION\nSupplementary Feeding Programmes 1 (SFPs) provide food supplements to individuals or groups of individuals considered as vulnerable within a given community. This vulnerability is either physiological (slightly to moderately malnourished individuals, pre-school age children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, the elderly and the sick), or related to specifi c living conditions to be found mainly in institutions such as hospitals, orphanages, homes for the elderly and prisons -this does not preclude general food distributions (GFD) in such environments. SFPs are thus understood in contrast to GFDs, 2 which target individuals forming overall households, and therapeutic feeding, 3 which is aimed at severely malnourished individuals. SFPs are discussed after therapeutic feeding, owing to their hybrid role between the two really effective nutritional measures in crisis: GFDs to forestall malnutrition, and therapeutic feeding to address severe forms of malnutrition. If GFDs and therapeutic feeding perform well, SFPs are not indispensable. SFPs are nevertheless common in humanitarian interventions, and are therefore discussed here although their contribution should remain peripheral. # POSITION IN HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION\nSFPs play a double role in humanitarian intervention: they provide both economic support and survival relief. They can also complement economic rehabilitation programmes."
