"national labour laws and social compensation schemes must be observed. \n# Stocks\nAlthough food stocks are discussed here, the following comments apply equally to medical and material stocks. The anticipation of needs, the rigorous monitoring of commodity movements, inventories and stock maintenance are all necessary in order to limit complications and temptation. \n# Anticipation of needs\nNeeds are anticipated according to weekly or monthly consumption patterns; this type of management allows for buffer stocks according to potential breakdowns in the logistics chain, and implies that orders be placed on time, according to usual delivery delays. While buffer stocks are necessary to allow for possible supply breakdowns, they must nevertheless be kept to a minimum to discourage looting."
