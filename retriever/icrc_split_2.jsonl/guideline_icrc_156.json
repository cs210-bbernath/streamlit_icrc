"Only a few particul a r a s p e c t s will be mentioned here. Surveillance of a food-distribution program entails monitoring food stocks, the distribution itself, 63 and the impact of the food aid on the beneficiaries' nutritional status. The last item is the most important part of the surveillance process, since it shows whether the distribution program is indeed achieving the desired result. The tool of surveillance is studied in detail in Chapter 6 (''Epidemiology''). Nonetheless, emphasis should be placed on the indicators that must be monitored, particularly:\n-nutritional status -intra-familial distribution of food aid -market prices -population movements. This sort of surveillance also provides the information necessary in order to decide when food distribution can be stopped. 63 Monitoring is necessary not only at the moment of distribution, but also afterwards, to make sure, first, that the beneficiaries are not robbed of their food rations, and second, that the goods received are not systematically resold on the local market by the beneficiaries themselves. The family budget is bolstered by the sale of some of the foodstuffs to buy other essential goods Needy families' access to food resources is re-established (this is in fact the main goal)\nThe nutritional status of the groups most affected by the famine is improved."
