"the organism and/or the feeding process, which must be addressed. As a result, it is useful to refer to indicators of wasting, which ultimately causes marasmus, and death. The most appropriate indicators of wasting are MUAC, MUAC-for-height, and weight-for-height. MUAC is a better warning of mortality than weight-for-height. The use of MUAC alone is adequate to select individuals, but the measurement of the nutritional status of an overall population is best done with MUAC-for-height. Many sources consider weight-for-height to be the best indicator (or reference indicator) for wasting; however, this is not backed by scientifi c evidence. To distinguish between anthropometric indicators according to their refl ection of wasting, they must be compared to another indicator that can serve as reference."
