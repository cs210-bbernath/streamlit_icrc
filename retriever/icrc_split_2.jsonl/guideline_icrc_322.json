"have direct consequences concerning the type and method of intervention. The screening and treatment of contagious patients are sufficient to reduce transmission markedly. If the pathogenic agent gains the upper hand, the subject will present biological and clinical manifestations. The biological form of the disease does not necessarily give rise to the clinical form. In regions characterized by endemic malaria, for example, individuals carrying the parasite are more often than not asymptomatic. By assessing the degree of imbalance between the subject's initial resistance and the magnitude of the pathogenic attack, we can anticipate the seriousness of the clinical manifestations, and take the necessary measures in time."
