"-Extent of morbidity or mortality An immunization campaign puts a heavy demand on resources. In emergencies, therefore, immunization should be reserved for diseases with high morbidity and/or mortality rates. Many studies have proven that measles, neonatal tetanus, and meningitis cause high mortality in developing countries, particularly in Africa. Poliomyelitis, too, is a major problem due to its potential sequelae. # Vaccine Effectiveness\nThe effectiveness of a vaccine is judged by its ability to confer lasting immunity. After complete immunization, the seroconversion for measles, for example, is 90-95%, for polio 98-100%, for tetanus 100%, for whooping cough 70-95%, and for diphtheria 95-98%. The duration of immunity is also an important factor."
