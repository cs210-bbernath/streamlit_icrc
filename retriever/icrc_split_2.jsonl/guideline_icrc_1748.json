Moreover, if specifi c defi ciencies are substantial within a TFC, the problem is likely to be equally serious outside, requiring action accordingly. Ideally, the population outside the TFC should be provided with adequate feeding, and this is not always possible by far. Usually, then, action is limited to the distribution of vitamin supplements or tablets."
