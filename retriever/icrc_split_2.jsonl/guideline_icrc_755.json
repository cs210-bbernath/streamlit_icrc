"Declaration made at the conclusion of the international conference held in Alma-Ata (USSR) on 12 September 1978, which marked a turning point in health service organization with regard to achieving a more equitable distribution of care. This conference gave rise to the WHO slogan ''health for all by the year 2000.'' The decision to orient a health-care system towards PHC obviously represents a political stand on the part of the government. In emergency situations, however, this political dimension is absent, except when the governments of donor countries or humanitarian agencies try to impose a hospital for high-level care during a disaster situation, in order to ''look good.''\n\n# The Management Aspect\nTwo principles are important with respect to management, the participation of the population and self-management. One of the basic principles of PHC is maximal delegation of responsibility to the population itself. In theory, this principle also applies in emergency situations: from the beginning of an intervention, the displaced or refugee population should be called upon to help take charge of its own health problems. It must be recognized, however, that on many occasions solutions are simply imposed upon the victims. There is thus a notorious difference between emergency situations and the practice of PHC under normal circumstances. 8 The ultimate goal is self-management of PHC programs by the population itself; the population furnishes the financial and human resources, and therefore decides the program's orientation. In such a case, PHC becomes a genuine process of development. The situation in this respect is markedly different in an emergency, when the health-care system functions almost exclusively thanks to outside help. # The Technical Aspect\nWHO recommends that PHC include at least the following activities:\n. education about health problems Thus, the same types of programs are adopted in both kinds of situation. # Appraisal of the Three Aspects of PHC\nIn an article comparing primary health care under normal circumstances with that dispensed in an emergency situation, authors from various academic circles (the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the University of California at Los Angeles, the National Council for International Health in Washington, Lousiana State University at New Orleans), as well as Oxfam and the High Commissioner for Refugees strongly emphasize that:\n''emergency medical aid must be considered as a means of intervention similar to long-term medical and sanitary action, implying the community-based, participatory approach of PHC. This concern to avoid cutting emergency medical-health interventions (EMHIs) off from long-term action is intended, on one hand, to counter the main criticisms of emergency medical aid, and, on the other, to take account of the fact that the needs of refugee populations are not essentially different from the everyday health needs of developing countries.'' 12\nSpecific health interventions are offered as an alternative to PHC services, which are judged to be utopian and expensive. These specific interventions are designed to focus exclusively on health priorities, which are technically defined according to the following criteria:\n& its morbidity and mortality; & its susceptibility to a treatment that can be easily applied to large groups. Thus, specific health interventions are intended to free individuals and communities from their principal health scourges and to save the most vulnerable lives. This definition has the merit of distinguishing emergency actions from true PHC. The most common types of intervention concern the following:\n. access to food resources;\n."
