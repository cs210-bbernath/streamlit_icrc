"-feeding vulnerable groups a meal equivalent to the supplementary ration. In the first case, the foods chosen must meet two kinds of criteria: they must be technically suitable for general distribution (perishability, transport, storage) and they must satisfy the nutritional needs of the beneficiaries. Usually supplementary feeding consists in increasing the proportion of legumes and fats already contained in the basic ration, bringing it to a total of 2,500 kcal and 70-75 grams of protein. In the second case, more specific foods can be used, such as powdered milk, eggs, etc. These foods are prepared at the feeding center and consumed there by all the vulnerable groups in the form of a daily meal."
