"The raw data that flow in during a disaster are often imprecise and contradictory, and are certainly an inadequate basis for deciding whether action should be taken and, if so, in what form. The first requirement, then, is to make an initial assessment of the situation. Mobile health units are not an assessment strategy, for assessments generate too many expectations on the part of the population. It is important to have thorough knowledge of the various actors involved, as it is they who will make it possible to apply modes of action other than substitution."
