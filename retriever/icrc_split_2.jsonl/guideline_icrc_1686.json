"of approximately 5 kcal (21 kJ) (WHO, 1985 andWaterlow, 1982). Thus, desired nutritional catch-up rates may be planned. In prisons for example, intakes can sometimes be easily controlled, and fi eld workers can set deadlines for the BMI of inmates to reach an acceptable level; the results are then observed and compared with the initial objective. The same type of calculation may be applied to malnourished groups assisted through GFD. The catchup component must then be defi ned. If, as indicated above, the catch-up of 1 g of tissue involves the consumption of 5 kcal, and one gram of tissue contains approximately 16% of protein, then 0.2 g of protein must be supplied (of which approximately 80% will be used), in addition to the 5 kcal."
