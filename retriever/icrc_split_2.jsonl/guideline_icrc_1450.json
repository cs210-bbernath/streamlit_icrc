"sample size in order to preserve the degree of accuracy. Experience shows that a factor of 2 (c = 2) is usually suffi cient: doubling the sample size obtained through the simple sampling formula adequately allows for the cluster effect. The adapted formula is as follows:\np \u00d7 q n = \u03b5 2 \u00d7 c \u00d7 ------- d 2\nWhere the cluster factor c = 2. In the case of cluster sampling intended to determine the experimental value of a prevalence rate expected to be of 20%, the sample size is the following: The number of clusters must then be determined: for example, 10 clusters amount to 49.2 subjects per cluster."
