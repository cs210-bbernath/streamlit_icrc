"Economic priorities usually take precedence over nutritional concerns when the amount of food is more or less suffi cient to satiate hunger. In the absence of nutritional knowledge, specifi c defi ciencies are unfortunately often overlooked, and clinical symptoms are not connected to dietary disorders in time. Moreover, if the demand for complementary foods is high, then their price rises and consequently their availability diminishes, and alternatives must be considered sooner or later."
