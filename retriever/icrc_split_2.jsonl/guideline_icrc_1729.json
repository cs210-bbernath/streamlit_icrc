"The protein-energy ratio (P/E%) is the percentage of the protein contribution to the overall energy of the diet. As a reminder, 1 g of protein supplies 4 kcal. Consequently, the protein-energy ratio, expressed in %, is obtained by multiplying the number of grams of protein in the ration by 4, dividing the result by the overall energy content of the ration, and multiplying the fi nal result by 100. Results are adequate, but such recipes lack several Type II nutrients (unlike F-75 Formula) whose interaction is essential in tissue synthesis. Annex 15 provides their composition and use."
