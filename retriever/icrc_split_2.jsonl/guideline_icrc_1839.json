"all times maintain at least a one-week reserve of water. Rather than arbitrary recommendations however, it is best to understand the water supply situation from the outset, and allow for the necessary corrective measures accordingly. Where water is scarce, rainwater recycling systems may be considered. For water distribution, it is best to resort to pipes equipped with automatic taps (i.e. spring-off type)\nin key locations such as kitchens, treatment units, intensive care units, and ablution and laundry units. Alternatively, jerrycans and cooking cauldrons can be used, avoiding contamination in the process. One staff member must be specially assigned to water supply and management."
