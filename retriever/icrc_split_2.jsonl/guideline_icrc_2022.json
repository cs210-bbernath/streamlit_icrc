"The principles of therapeutic feeding are the same for children, adolescents, and adults. This Chapter concentrates on the treatment of severe malnutrition as practised in therapeutic feeding centres (TFC) that are set up in response to crisis. # NUTRITION MANUAL\n2.1 Understanding the problem Chapter XIII -Therapeutic feeding 2. Planning therapeutic feeding and the situation\n\n# PLANNING THERAPEUTIC FEEDING\nFigure 13.3 below illustrates the planning process for the treatment of severe malnutrition and its implementation parameters. # Figure 13.3\nLogical sequence for the treatment of severe malnutrition in a TFC\nThe planning -implementation sequence illustrated in Figure 13.3 above corresponds to an operational logic that permits:\n9 the justifi cation for the programme and its integration into the overall operational strategy; 9 the implementation of the programme with the best possible chances of success. A therapeutic feeding plan is based on the following criteria:\n9 a declared and adequately documented problem of severe malnutrition has been confi rmed; 9 therapeutic feeding can be translated into a feasible programme; 9 the programme fi ts into an overall and consistent operational strategy; 9 the termination criteria of the programme have been defi ned from the outset. # UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM AND THE SITUATION\nTherapeutic feeding programmes must be based on a convincing demonstration that they respond to a need in terms of the magnitude of the problem (the size of the affected population), its seriousness (severe malnutrition rates), the prognosis (rising, falling, or stable rates), and its causes (e.g. food insuffi ciency, inadequate care, and sickness)."
