"acts, the health-care personnel must apply the rules very strictly. \n# Monitoring the Observance of International Humanitarian Law and the Mechanisms of Sanction in Case of Violation\nThe best way of monitoring the application of international humanitarian law is to be present in the field, out where the victims are. This is the ICRC's modus operandi. Proximity to the victims allows observers to verify on the spot whether or not the rules of international humanitarian law are actually being respected. In this respect, access to the victims is a major concern for the ICRC. The record on the application of international humanitarian law has so far been depressing: an increasing number of conflicts, in the course of which populations are attacked indiscriminately and refused the right to humanitarian relief."
