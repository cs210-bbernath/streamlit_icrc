"relief operations that may later prove to have been unnecessary. To facilitate the decision-making process, organizations tend to adopt specific quantitative criteria for intervention, such as a death rate higher than 2/10,000 per day or a malnutrition rate that is considerably higher than normal. These parameters define situations that are already much deteriorated and that urgently require intervention. Clearly, however, organizations should not wait until health status has reached this point; far better to intervene with preventive measures when mortality and malnutrition levels are still within acceptable limits. Timely intervention costs much less than resorting to emergency air transport, purchases made under pressure without the opportunity to issue tenders, etc."
