"Denunciation and Discretion The option of discretion has its limits. Accordingly, when negotiations lead nowhere and international humanitarian law is repeatedly violated, it is reasonable to change strategy. The switch to denunciation should be made only after careful deliberation. The ICRC reserves the option of appealing to the international community when it believes that all other forms of action have proven to be in vain. As it stressed in a declaration before the Commission on Human Rights, it calls upon both the parties to a conflict and the international community to make every effort to put an end to unacceptable practices of every kind, including, of course, the detention of thousands of civilians in dangerous conditions."
