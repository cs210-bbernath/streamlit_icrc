"They protect the privacy of the users. # Building Dry Pit Latrines\nBefore embarking on a latrineconstruction program, relief planners should examine certain parameters. As for all wastedisposal systems, three aspects must be considered:\n& Social parameters\nThe most important requirement in a latrine is that it be socially acceptable to the community; otherwise it will not be used. In addition, more specific social factors must be taken into account, such as the use of latrines by children (meaning construction standards must be oriented towards safe and easy use). It will also be necessary to build two groups of latrines, one for women and one for men. Before any sanitary facilities are set up, thought must be given to how they will be maintained. Not only will badly maintained latrines not receive much use, but they themselves will increase the risk of communicable diseases. Among all these factors, one point in particular must be kept in mind: Implementing a latrine-construction project requires community participation at all levels -choice of method, building, and maintenance. # Factors Influencing the Choice of a Human-Waste Disposal System\nCultural acceptability by the population Choice of a technical method suited to the environment\n& What happens to the waste? This may seem a hare-brained question to ask in an emergency situation."
