"raise matters such as alleged breaches of international humanitarian law. The fact that protection activities show no quantifiable or visible results is not a sufficient reason for abandoning the indispensable dimension of protection in an ICRC operational approach of whatever nature. Every delegation must be constantly aware of the need to include a protection component in its activities, so as to take maximum advantage of the potential of a situation and thus deal as effectively as possible with problems of protection. The first beneficiaries of ICRC protection are the Ministry of Health representatives who accompany us on MHU programmes in the field."
