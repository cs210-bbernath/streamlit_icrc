"(general food distributions combined with nutritional information campaigns where relevant). It is worth reiterating that priorities must be set in a manner that guarantees the consistency of nutritional programmes with others, in line with the priorities illustrated by the health pyramid and overall economic security. In nutrition strictly, the protection of rights and general food distributions are effective at all levels of action in averting a deterioration of the health status, unlike curative nutritional means such as therapeutic and, sometimes, supplementary feeding. If general food distributions are necessary but cannot be implemented, it is useless to resort to another form of nutritional action that is of secondary importance to such distributions in the operational strategy."
