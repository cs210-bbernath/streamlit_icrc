"It may be necessary to eliminate particles prior to fi ltration, and they must in any case be eliminated prior to purifi cation. Depending on the nature and turbidity of the water, the fi ltration process can cause particles in suspension to clog fi lters completely. Proper chemical purifi cation of turbid water can be diffi cult, and the process involves large amounts of disinfectant. Sedimentation can be passive, involving the storage of water in a container or the slow, spontaneous, passage of water through a settlement (or decantation) trough so that particles settle spontaneously; it can also be active, which is faster and involves the fl occulation of particles with aluminium sulphate. Sedimentation rates vary considerably according to the size and nature of the particles in suspension. Filtration refers to a broad range of processes, which all aim at separating two or more substances. Slow fi ltration involves passing the water through sand (0.2 m per hour), so that solids are trapped, while the fl uid passes through. This principle relies upon the size difference between the particles making up the fl uid, and the particles making up the solid. The process substantially improves the microbiological quality of the water by trapping or destroying most types of virus, bacteria, protozoan cysts and helminthic (worm) eggs. Trapping and destruction occur within the top layers of the fi lter through the development of a micro-fl ora whose biological activity kills micro-organisms, whereas the formation of a layer of waste strengthens the fi lter through a clotting process (Cairncross & Feachem, 1993). Sand fi ltration requires no more than a simple barrel fi lled with alternating layers of sand and gravel. Oxfam material is commonly used in humanitarian operations; this equipment is highly effective, and consists of three reservoirs. The fi rst is a storage (and, thus, sedimentation) reservoir that contains the untreated water."
