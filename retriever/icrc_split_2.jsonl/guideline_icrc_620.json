"practical, logistic, and technological aspects. indicators or else reduce their value, since they are thereby subject to distortions. Moreover, the available technical facilities are often limited. Therefore, relief teams must settle for simple indicators. The selection of indicators is an important point, since it is a job that the health-care personnel out in the field are usually obliged to perform in order to monitor the progress of a relief operation. In the initial assessment of an emergency situation, a limited number of indicators are employed -enough to define the problems rapidly, but not always enough to monitor their evolution. Accordingly, when a routine surveillance system is instituted, the choice of indicators must be fine-tuned to provide a better picture of the changing situation. # Criteria for Choosing Sources of Information 2.1 Quality of an Information Source\n\n# Quality of Information\nInformation must be complete; data on cases of diarrhea or measles are hard to interpret if they are not linked to the age of the subjects. # Continuity\nWhile initial assessments tend to give a picture of the situation at a given moment, the purpose of surveillance is to juxtapose a succession of pictures in order to analyze the evolution, or trend, of a health problem. Information sources which send in data only half the time, for example, impede this kind of analysis. # Qualities Required in a Test or Data-Collecting Method for Emergency Situations\nTraditional qualities:\n- Representativeness - Validity - Reliability\nQualities more specific to emergencies:\n- Applicability -speed -simplicity -reproducibility - Acceptability:\n-by the population -by the authorities\n\n# Uniformity\nAll information sources must respect the same criteria for defining the indicators and the tests used. # Improving the Reliability of Information Sources\n\n# Training\nAdequate training of the personnel commissioned to collect data and convey them to analysis centers is essential if quality information is to be obtained. # Availability of Simple, Effective Means\nThe danger of false, incomplete data increases with the complexity of the questionnaires that health-care personnel must fill out. Thus, it is preferable to make a correct analysis based on simple facts rather than to base the analysis on complex but false information. The use of computer programs (EPIINFO) to construct questionnaires is a quick and effective solution -provided you know how to run a computer program! # Personnel Motivation\nTraining helps motivate the staff, since it clarifies the purpose of collecting the data."
