"Artifi cial feeding is in fact sometimes a deliberate choice on the part of the mother who can usually afford it. On the other hand, the poor who are unaware of the dangers of artifi cial feeding face high chances of failure (and thus mortality), mainly because of diffi culties to access/procure an expensive commodity that is usually imported; this is especially true in a crisis. The product must then be prepared in impeccable hygiene conditions, in compliance with the manufacturer's instructions."
