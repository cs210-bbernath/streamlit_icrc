"determined and ranked according to their contribution to needs coverage. Finally, these two classifi cations are combined in an analysis matrix whose boxes indicate dwellings and their number of inhabitants, according to cross analysis. This provides a synthetic representation of the groups that are considered to be most at risk, that is, those located above the diagonal connecting the lower left-hand corner and the upper right-hand corner of the matrix. The diagonal may be moved upwards for greater specifi city, or downwards for greater sensitivity. The relative vulnerability hypothesis is then tested. The relative vulnerability matrix is an assessment tool; in the course of hypothesis testing, it becomes an analytical tool and, following hypothesis confi rmation, a presentation tool."
