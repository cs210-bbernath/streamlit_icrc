"Unfortunately, there are no weight-for-height tables that apply to adolescents. This Manual therefore combines existing tables for height for age and weight for age for girls and boys aged between 2 and 18 years (WHO, 1983). Results are provided within one centimetre, rounded up to the closest category as an approximate where necessary."
