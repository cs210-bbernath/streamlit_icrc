"strain from the one normally found in that particular environment. Thus, for example, the appearance along the border between Thailand and Cambodia of colonies of Plasmodium falciparum resistant to the major antimalarial drugs has been attributed in part to the intermixing of populations in that area. The primary victims of this phenomenon are the displaced people themselves (although they may have a certain degree of immunity), but the local population may also be affected, being usually much more sensitive to a new pathogenic agent. Conversely, by changing environment, a displaced population may be confronted by a new pathogenic agent against which it has no immunity."
