"& Primary Prevention Primary prevention can be defined as the prevention of the biological and clinical manifestations of an infection. Immunization and sanitation measures fall into this category. # & Secondary Prevention\nSecondary prevention means preventing a harmless form of the disease from developing into a more serious form liable to cause death or complications. # Results\n\n# Acquisition of immunity\nHealthy carriers\n- serious clinical forms the example of tuberculosis, the identification and treatment of tubercular patients with positive sputum can be considered as a form of primary prevention from the community's point of view, insofar as this therapeutic activity reduces the source of contamination. # Intervention Strategies\nThe natural cycle described earlier can be considered as the framework of the system for controlling communicable diseases, which provides the foundation for the other intervention systems:\n-environmental sanitation of the environment, in order to reduce sources of infection (primary prevention); -feeding and nutrition, which contribute in some measure to maintaining immune status; -therapeutic system to look after sick individuals requiring outpatient or hospital care. The activities corresponding to these various strategies must be coordinated harmoniously in order to constitute an effective control program: treatment of diarrhea, provision of sufficient quantities of clean water, immunization against measles and the establishment of procedures for treating measles, etc. The intervention strategy may be oriented in two different ways:\n-the vertical approach: a health team takes charge of one particular communicable disease, to the exclusion of all others. -the horizontal approach: a health team takes charge of a group of communicable diseases and, if necessary, the collateral interventions linked to them. This subject will be discussed in detail in Chapter 7 (''The Health-Care System'')."
