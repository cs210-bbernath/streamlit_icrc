"of TFC that can be opened in a given region. Centres have been known to accommodate between 100 and 1,400 patients. Smaller centres are easier to manage and their atmosphere is usually more relaxed and personal. Still, larger centres may be necessary in disasters, and are just as effi cient as smaller structures, provided that they are adequately staffed. The number of patients determines the TFC layout and the magnitude of its facilities. 9 Access to the TFC is much infl uenced by its location. If the target population is close by and access is easy, there is no need for annexes for the permanent accommodation of patients and their carers (other than during initial treatment, when 24-hour attention is necessary) -this is usually the case in camps for refugees or the displaced, and in towns."
