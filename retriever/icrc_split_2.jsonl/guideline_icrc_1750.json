"ensure proper registration, whichever way it may ultimately be performed. 5. Preparing the material required -tables, chairs, stationery, registration lists and ledgers, rope and poles in order to channel queues, megaphones, markers to identify registered persons, etc. 6. Performing census and registration proper. \n# Individual census and registration\nThis approach consists in gathering the population in one or more locations, and registering all its members on the same day, if possible at the same time in order to avoid people registering twice in different locations. All able persons, young and old, must report. Exceptionally, sick, helpless, or absent individuals may be registered provisionally, provided that the reasons are valid (for example, persons who have had to remain in the village or neighbourhood to watch over it in the absence of its population), but each case must be verifi ed independently."
