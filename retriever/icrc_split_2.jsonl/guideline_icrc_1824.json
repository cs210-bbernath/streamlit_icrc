"Systematic care is different from individual care. # Systematic care\n\n# Measles vaccinations\nMeasles is a particularly virulent disease, often fatal for malnourished children. It can propagate extremely fast in a feeding centre. It is therefore indispensable, systematically upon admission, to vaccinate children previously not vaccinated, doubtful cases and those without vaccination cards. Their presence in the centre provides the opportunity to update vaccinations."
