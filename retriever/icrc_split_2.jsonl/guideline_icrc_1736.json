"the minimum level of assistance required in the given circumstances. \n# Feasibility\nIt may be diffi cult to single out specifi c households within a given community. The exercise entails two major challenges. The fi rst relates to the targeting itself, which may not be acceptable to the community and/or their leaders. Some cultures require that assistance be shared among all members of the community, and targeting specifi c households is pointless in this case. Such cultures usually rest upon strong social obligations, and the redistribution of wealth to the poor is automatic; reciprocity mechanisms are strongly respected in such settings and, even in the case of targeting, redistribution will probably occur."
