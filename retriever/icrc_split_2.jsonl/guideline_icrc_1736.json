"The third type is irreversible, and requires a completely lactose-free diet. It is however very rare, because subjects who suffer from it usually die young since they are unable to digest maternal milk -unless parents can secure suitable substitution formulae.

Congenital intolerance manifests itself in abundant watery diarrhoea soon after the ingestion of lactose; this diarrhoea stops when the ingestion of milk stops, and resumes with it. Should such cases appear nevertheless, the patient must be fed yoghurt or a lactose-free commercial formula. However, sudden and abundant watery diarrhoea should suggest cholera rather than congenital lactose intolerance. # Preventing and treating infection\nInfection is a common complication of severe malnutrition."
