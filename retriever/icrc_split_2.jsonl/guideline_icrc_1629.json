"it is worth repeating that its success depends on organization. The staff in charge must be available, have the means to operate (i.e. accommodation, vehicles, and material), and tasks must be clearly defi ned and attributed. Of particular importance is the establishment of an operational centre, which ensures liaison with logistics staff and a reporting system to record the conduct of the operation (for instance in the form of logbooks) -this in time constitutes a sort of archive of developments, decisions, setbacks, and solutions. Such archives facilitate the programme evaluation process subsequently, and also promote consistency when teams rotate. In principle, reports should be produced after every distribution, indicating the number of recipients, the overall tonnage for each commodity, and remarks regarding situation updates and operational progress."
