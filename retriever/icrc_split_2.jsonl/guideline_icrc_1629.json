"Such units can be attached to paediatric wards, or remain independent if the main paediatric disorder is malnutrition. Unit staff can also contribute to other healthcare tasks when the TFC is less busy. # INTEGRATION INTO THE OPERATIONAL STRATEGY\nAs seen in Section 1.3 above, therapeutic feeding is necessary but not a priority if malnutrition results from a general deterioration in living conditions and acquires epidemic proportions. This means that it must be included in the range of measures that constitute the overall operational strategy, and must not be applied in isolation; to avoid TFC saturation and ensure that discharged patients will not return to the living conditions that caused their malnutrition in the fi rst place and thus risk relapse. # Implementing therapeutic feeding\nprogrammes for the treatment 2.4 Termination criteria of severe malnutrition 3.1 Therapeutic feeding centres 9 severe malnutrition is not expected to recur; 9 the level of TFC admissions no longer justifi es its maintenance -this practical criterion is the last of the termination criteria, and determines the ultimate decision to close the programme. Residual cases are then referred to existing healthcare facilities, whose ability to treat them (that is, their resources and skills) must be confi rmed. # IMPLEMENTING THERAPEUTIC FEEDING PROGRAMMES FOR THE TREATMENT OF SEVERE MALNUTRITION\nThe implementation of therapeutic feeding programmes requires the following elements to be established:\n9 the therapeutic feeding centre (TFC) (Section 3.1); 9 the criteria for admission and discharge (Section 3.2); 9 TFC operational procedures (Section 3.3); 9 TFC operational monitoring and evaluation (Section 3.4). # THERAPEUTIC FEEDING CENTRES\nTherapeutic feeding programmes are run through therapeutic feeding centres (TFC). Such centres are organized so as to provide the indispensable services required to treat patients suffering from severe malnutrition."
