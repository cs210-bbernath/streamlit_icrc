"This may improve the material situation of the civilian population (unless material aid is diverted by the armed group), but will not improve the victims' security. Assist the populations concerned and exert pressure on the leaders of the armed group or the regional authorities. This is the most sensible approach, but presents the risk of hardening the authorities' stance vis-a`-vis the humanitarian organizations, which may ultimately be denied access to the victims. 3 These two examples show how difficult it is to find a way of satisfying the victims' immediate needs while still maintaining ethical principles. # Strategy and Violations of International Humanitarian Law\nConfronted with violations of international humanitarian law, humanitarian agencies have a choice of two strategies which, although apparently contradictory, are in fact complementary. One involves appealing to international public opinion, while the other employs discretion in bilateral negotiations with the responsible authorities. The strategy of denouncing violations of international humanitarian law is meant to alert governments and the international community in general to the difficulties humanitarian agencies face in the normal performance of their work. The danger of this strategy, as mentioned above, is that it can harden the attitudes of the authorities responsible for blocking access to the victims; this may affect other vulnerable groups who already benefit from the presence of humanitarian agencies. The strategy of discretion consists in betting on the success of bilateral negotiations with the authorities responsible for the violations of international humanitarian law to persuade them to change their attitude towards the victims. Humanitarian agencies must choose between these two strategies. The ICRC has opted for discretion, whereas other organizations, such as Amnesty International, have chosen public denunciation. The two approaches are complementary, but in general each organization adheres to the line it has adopted. # The Limits of Denunciation and Discretion\nThe option of discretion has its limits. Accordingly, when negotiations lead nowhere and international humanitarian law is repeatedly violated, it is reasonable to change strategy. The switch to denunciation should be made only after careful deliberation. The ICRC reserves the option of appealing to the international community when it believes that all other forms of action have proven to be in vain. As it stressed in a declaration before the Commission on Human Rights, it calls upon both the parties to a conflict and the international community to make every effort to put an end to unacceptable practices of every kind, including, of course, the detention of thousands of civilians in dangerous conditions. 4\n\n# Humanitarian Strategy and the Interests of the Parties to the Conflict\nUsually, the victims have not chosen their camp. However, the parties to the conflict frequently choose their victims."
