"treat war-wounded in a region with no hospitals at all. It is difficult to determine criteria when facilities exist but do not function in a satisfactory manner, or, worse, when the services furnished are below the standards that would be considered normal in a particular context. Humanitarian agencies give themselves the ''right'' to take over the facilities in question in order to improve their performance, reorganizing their management, investing in them, etc. In this case, the question of the facility's autonomy or dependence vis-a`-vis the authorities normally responsible arises. Without real control over the facility's operation, relief organizations cannot expect rapid change; the aid they provide will go to produce services which will always be below the norm."
