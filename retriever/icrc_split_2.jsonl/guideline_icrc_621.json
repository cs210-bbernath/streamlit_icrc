"the importance of characteristics in data distribution: persons, place, etc. Data distribution involves entire population groups which will subsequently be compared with each other. 16 A way must be found of distributing individual data within each population group, to facilitate comparison between them. For a given population, the procedure is first to calculate the indices of central tendency (means), and then to establish the distribution of all the individuals in that population around the mean (index of dispersion). This, then, represents an individual distribution of data, as opposed to the distribution by population group studied previously. On the basis of these indices, comparisons can be made using tests adapted to the data-collection method (significance tests)."
