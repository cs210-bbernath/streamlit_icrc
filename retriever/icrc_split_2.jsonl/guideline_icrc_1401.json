"on the spot, but courtesy is essential at all times. However, interviews with key informants should in principle be prepared well in advance in order to ensure their earliest availability: such interlocutors are usually very busy. Individual and household interviews clarify the victims' perception of their situation and behaviour, and facilitate the decision as to what should be done. This information is clearly biased, and such interviews must as a result be multiplied and involve enough groups that are different with respect to the crisis. There is however no rule as to the ideal number of interviews. The consistent pattern that gradually appears in answers shows that an adequate number of sources has been reached."
