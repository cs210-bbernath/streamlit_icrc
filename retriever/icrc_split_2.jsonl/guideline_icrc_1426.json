"total number of tents provides the overall population number (N). As an indication, if each tent accommodates one mother, then the proportion of children in this age group is approximately 15%. If the total number of tents is 4,000, and the total camp population is 20,000, then the number of children corresponding to the criteria is approximately 3,000 (N), i.e. 0.75 children per tent. If the sample size is 350 (n), then 466.7 tents (350 / 0.75) must be visited (rounded up to 467). The interval size is 4,000 / 467 = 8.57 tents, rounded down to 8. The fi rst tent is selected randomly between 1 and 8, and sampling continues by selecting every eighth tent thereafter."
