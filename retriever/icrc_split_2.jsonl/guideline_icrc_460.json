"measures to control other communicable diseases (environmental hygiene, in particular). \n# Control Programs\nThe control of intestinal parasites can be limited to the control of the diseases caused by the parasites, or it can be expanded to include control of parasitic infection. The first case calls for an individual approach; in the second, the orientation is communal and focuses on environmental hygiene, the water supply, health education, essential drugs, food and nutrition, epidemiology, etc. In emergency situations, when hygienic conditions are precarious and the rate of infestation is high, efforts must be made to reduce both the rate of infection and the rate of disease."
