"# NUTRITION MANUAL\nChapter XII -General food distribution 3. GFD implementation 3.2 Setting rations    a Ration 7 is an example of a ration that cannot be diversifi ed (as is the case, for instance, in prisons). It must in this case imperatively be combined with the distribution of tablets or powders that contain the essential micro-nutrients that are lacking in the basic ration. b If the cereal is distributed in the form of fl our and is to be used to produce bread, yeast must also be supplied. c 66.7 g of CSB may be replaced with 50 g of biscuits, provided that this completes the micro-nutrient content of the basic ration. d OE/TE = energy supplied by oil/total energy supplied."
