"is moderately malnourished, and below 16, it is severely malnourished. The choice of 18.5 as the cut-off point for normality is explained by the fact that health problems are not observed in BMI cases located above that threshold. However, experience in prisons in several countries shows that most adults whose BMI lies between 18.5 and 20 are wasted with respect to the nutritional status that would be theirs if access to food were suffi cient, and that their physical capacity is substantially diminished. This observation was in fact confi rmed in the case of a specifi c prison in which undernourished and highly wasted inmates fi nally gained unlimited access to an adequate diet."
