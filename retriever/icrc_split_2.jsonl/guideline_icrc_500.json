"the single-dose treatment often proves to be the more effective. In addition, it does not demand as much of the health-care personnel's time and energy. Its main disadvantages are that it is often more expensive, and that it does not correspond to local therapeutic practice. In every situation, the pros and cons of the two approaches must be weighed. Conventional treatment proves more effective than single-dose treatment in diseases such as bacterial meningitis, 21 schistosomiasis, and amebiasis. The opposite is true for tuberculosis, owing to the difference in the cost/benefit ratio between the short and long treatments. The use of placebos in emergency situations is controversial."
