"Vulnerability can be reduced by increasing and protecting livelihoods and decreasing the degree of exposure to hazard. It is important to distinguish between shocks/hazards originating from outside the community (those that affect all people in the same locality) and shocks/hazards that principally affect only individual households (e.g. the breadwinner is HIV positive, discrimination, etc.). Resilience is the ability to reduce, prepare for, resist and recover from shocks/hazards. A totally vulnerable household means a household without any resilience to face a shock/hazard; a household that can absorb a shock/hazard is a household with an appropriate level of resilience. The longer the shock/hazard lasts, the more the sources of income and coping mechanisms are at risk, to the point that they may all be lost."
