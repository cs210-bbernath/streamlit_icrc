"This can be the case provided that they are not implemented in isolation, and that they contribute to the implementation of all the steps required to respond to the need for assistance. SFPs can then easily be changed to address persisting moderate malnutrition effectively, and act as safety nets -meaning that they are no longer consigned to simple food distributions. # INTERVENTION CRITERIA\nUsually in a nutritional crisis, SFPs should be curative; as a result, the criterion triggering their implementation is moderate malnutrition. It should also be possible to address this malnutrition effi ciently, that is, the programme should aim at reducing moderate malnutrition rates rapidly, providing safety nets or a relay for therapeutic feeding once all necessary measures previously taken have proven ineffective. These circumstances are indeed those in which SFPs have the greatest impact, are most justifi ed, and entail the least negative side effects. Where SFPs aim at temporarily containing the effects of a crisis, the moderate malnutrition criterion should also reveal restricted access to food, unless available means permit the implementation of a preventive SFP. This is uncommon; if it were the case, the criterion would be restricted access to food."
