"12. Covenant may take measures derogating from their obligations under the present Covenant to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with their other obligations under international law and do not involve discrimination solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin.'' 17 Nevertheless, the rights constituting the ''hard core'' of human rights cannot be put aside. These are the intangible rights -for example, the right to life, the right not to be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment, and the right not to be enslaved. # Precision of Legal Rules\nA contradiction may be seen between the impossibility of derogating from the rules of international humanitarian law and the obligation to make allowance for ''military necessity.'' In fact, the provisions of international humanitarian law precisely define the limits of ''military necessity'': ''Unlike human rights law, which is set out as a series of general rights which all persons have, humanitarian law takes the form of detailed rules which the parties to the conflict are bound to follow.'' 18\n\n# Universality\nThe concept of universality was extensively debated during the Vienna Conference on Human Rights in 1993. Human rights laws are legal provisions which derive from moral values, the perception of which may vary from one culture to the next. Even the principle of the universality of human rights is not totally accepted, and the legal instruments adopted to protect human rights have not been universally ratified. In contrast, the treaties of humanitarian law have been ratified by most States. # Implementation\nThe rules governing the implementation of the two branches of international law are different. The United Nations has several mechanisms for the implementation of human rights law (for example, the Human Rights Commission); for humanitarian law, the ICRC plays a vital role. # The Application of International Humanitarian Law\nThe rules of international humanitarian law are sufficiently explicit to guarantee the protection of non-combatants. Yet reality has shown their application to be 17 Art. 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966). 18 ICRC, Human Rights and the ICRC: International Humanitarian Law, p."
