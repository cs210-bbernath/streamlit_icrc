"The Executive Board is in charge of the conduct of affairs. It meets once a week and, like the Assembly, is chaired by the President of the ICRC. # Role\nThe ICRC's role is defined in Article 4 of its Statutes:\n''1. The role of the ICRC shall be in particular:\n''a) to maintain and disseminate the Fundamental Principles of the Movement, namely humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity and universality; b) to recognize any newly established or reconstituted National Society, which fulfils the conditions for recognition set out in the Statutes of the Movement, and to notify other National Societies of such recognition; c) to undertake the tasks incumbent upon it under the Geneva Conventions, to work for the faithful application of international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts and to take cognizance of any complaints based on alleged breaches of that law; d) to endeavour at all times -as a neutral institution whose humanitarian work is carried out particularly in time of international and other armed conflicts or internal strife -to ensure the protection of and assistance to military and civilian victims of such events and of their direct results; e) to ensure the operation of the Central Tracing Agency as provided in the Geneva Conventions; f) to contribute, in anticipation of armed conflicts, to the training of medical personnel and the preparation of medical equipment, in co-operation with the National Societies, the military and civilian medical services and other competent authorities; g) to work for the understanding and dissemination of knowledge of international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts and to prepare any development thereof; h) to carry out mandates entrusted to it by the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent (the International Conference). 2. The ICRC may take any humanitarian initiative which comes within its role as a specifically neutral and independent institution and intermediary, and may consider any question requiring examination by such an institution.'' Of these tasks, a closer look should be taken at the ICRC's ''legal role''. The institution is required to ''work for the faithful application'' of the Geneva Conventions (letter c above). These means that it reminds the parties to armed conflicts (governments, but also, in internal conflicts, armed opposition groups) of their legal obligations. It is also the promoter and custodian of humanitarian law. In practice, ICRC delegates oversee the application of the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols through their presence in the field, for example when visiting prisoners of war. They forward their observations to the parties in conflict and make recommendations. The ICRC is also charged with ensuring the protection and assistance of the victims of armed conflicts and internal disturbances (letter d above). It has many activities in this respect, in particular relief operations for the civilian population (food, medical care, shelter, drinking water, etc.). Its Central Tracing Agency forwards messages between the members of families separated by war, traces the missing and makes it possible for families to be reunited. The ICRC has a broad right of humanitarian initiative (paragraph 2 above) which enables it to offer its services when the presence of a specifically neutral and independent institution and intermediary may help resolve humanitarian issues. For example, the ICRC has access to political detainees. The ICRC's protection and assistance activities are also conducted for people displaced within their own countries who, during armed conflicts, are protected by humanitarian law. Refugees also come under the ICRC's mandate when they are protected by humanitarian law, when they face major security problems, or when UNHCR is unable to come to their aid. # The National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\nIn peacetime, the National Societies' activities are generally concentrated in sectors such as health, health education, and natural-disaster relief. In situations of armed conflict, the National Societies are called to come to the aid of the victims. The ICRC has a preponderant role as intermediary in such situations, and as such it works together with the National Societies of the parties to the conflict. The ICRC can also recruit health-care personnel in countries that are not involved in the hostilities."
