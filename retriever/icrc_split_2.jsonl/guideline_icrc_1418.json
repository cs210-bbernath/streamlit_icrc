"dice, or NUTRITION MANUAL Chapter X -Assessment and planning 3. General aspects I. Assessment of assessment methods 3.4 Selecting subjects mechanical sampling performed by a calculator (or computer spreadsheets) that generates random numbers. 16 Selected numbers are then all subjected to the survey itself. It is often impossible to conduct a comprehensive census, or to have access to the entire population, and the process can be quite costly and time-consuming. Systematic and cluster sampling methods reduce this type of constraint substantially. Another (less rigorous) random sampling method produces accurate results, provided that the enquiry area is homogenous with respect to the variable under scrutiny."
