"that has been previously boiled for at least 10 minutes. Health staff however sometimes increases protein supplies during initial treatment; this practice is dangerous because protein quickly becomes toxic in severely malnourished patients, as they cannot excrete excess nitrogen easily, and this can lead to kidney and heart failure -manifesting itself in oedema and ultimately death. In such cases, it is tempting to increase protein supplies because kwashiorkor oedema is all too often ascribed to protein defi ciency, but this only worsens the situation. Hence the occasional reports of serious marasmus cases that developed kwashiorkor, and eventually died. In this particular case, oedema is totally unrelated to kwashiorkor, and results from kidney failure."
