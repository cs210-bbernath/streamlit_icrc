"these groups de facto lack access to a balanced diet). \n# The development of defi ciency and symptoms\nWhere the diet consists entirely of maize, clinical signs appear within 50 to 60 days (Machlin, 1984). This timeframe has been determined in experimentation. In humanitarian practice, it is however often diffi cult to determine the former diet of a population facing nutritional crisis. As a result, if niacin defi ciency is suspected but not yet obvious, it should be addressed before the appearance of clinical signs -in the case of pellagra, these usually consist of the four \"Ds\": dermatosis, diarrhoea, dementia, and death, but this is not always borne out by reality."
