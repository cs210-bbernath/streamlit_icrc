"The technical specifications of each pump will not be described here; this section will focus instead on the criteria for choosing a particular type of pump in a given situation. To avoid long lists, 22 decisionmakers should focus on two main criteria and a few secondary ones. The first criterion is the operating mechanism of the pump, which may be one of two types: -the water is drawn up from above towards the outlet. -the water is pushed up from below, to the pump outlet. In the first case, the operating cylinder is above the well; in the second, it is in the water. Although the first solution would appear to be simpler, it is limited by the laws of physics, since if the water level is more than eight meters down, the pump can no longer operate. 23 The static level of the water table, then, will influence the choice of pump. The second criterion concerns the method of operating the pump: -manually (hand pump) -by an external energy source, such as wind, electricity, or sun. The factors to be considered in this choice are as follows:  27 the temptation is to install powerful technical means to provide maximum flow. If, however, water reserves (for example, the ground water) have been overestimated -or not been taken into account at all -they are apt to be quickly exhausted, with repercussions not only for the population's health status, but also for the environment. # Water Storage\nOnce the water has been drawn from its source, it can be put directly at the population's disposal or channeled into a storage unit from which it will be distributed. # Criteria Dictating the Use of a Storage Unit\n. Water Quality If the water is of poor quality (for example, water pumped directly from a river), it must be treated. For proper treatment, whatever the technique (filtration, chemical treatment), the water must be stored. The storage area will depend on geography and the configuration of the distribution network that will be integrated with it."
