"programmes also reduce anaemia prevalence levels signifi cantly (Davidson, 1979). \n# Vulnerability\nPregnant women are most vulnerable to folate acid defi ciency because of the increased cell multiplication resulting from foetal and placental growth, and during the expansion of the uterus and the overall blood volume. The risk is clearly magnifi ed by a mediocre diet, that is, in case of poverty. But children and adolescents are only slightly less vulnerable, because their growth requires additional folic acid with respect to their maintenance needs. The elderly are also vulnerable because of their common and typical changes in diet. In other words, women of childbearing age are clearly the most vulnerable to iron defi ciency, followed by children and adolescents."
