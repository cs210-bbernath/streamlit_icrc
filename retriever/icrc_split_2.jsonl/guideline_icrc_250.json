"# Community Involvement\nThe community must be involved at all stages of the project: choosing the source, deciding on the technical set-up (pumps, distribution system, etc.) and especially implementing the project. Systems that are supplied ready-made, without community involvement, are doomed to failure owing to lack of interest, insufficient motivation to insure maintenance, and, in the short term, lack of use. 40 \n\n# Level of Health Education\nThe health-education factor is significant primarily at the family level. Strict water management implies preserving it from any contamination and using it advisedly (particularly during episodes of diarrheal diseases). # Cost\nCost is generally not an issue in emergency situations where ''everything is free.''\nWater use represents the meeting point between technology and health. A water-supply system's performance is not judged solely by its capacity to provide water, but by the extent to which it is used by the beneficiaries and, consequently, by its impact on a population's health status. 40 ''In water supply and sanitation programmes, planners have come to realize that community participation, among other things, is essential for projects to be successful. This represents a vast change from former projects in which the community was seen as a passive recipient of facilities planned and provided by the central government.''
