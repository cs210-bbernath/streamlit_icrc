"# Magnitude of the malnutrition problem according to its prevalence\nThe measured nutritional status of a given population must be adequately interpreted. However, the magnitude of malnutrition is not to be confused with the seriousness of the nutritional situation. For example, a serious primary wasting rate of 30% indicates a serious malnutrition problem, but if this rate is registered shortly before the harvest, which is anticipated to be exceptionally good, this does not justify alarm as to the overall population's nutritional status. Likewise, a serious primary wasting rate of 10% does not indicate a major malnutrition problem, but if it is recorded shortly before the hungry season, it may justify concern as to the nutritional situation. Table 10.4 below provides the data required to qualify the severity of the malnutrition problem. # MARKET ANALYSIS\nThe fi eld study of local markets is fundamental, because it provides a good idea of the local economy. Market analysis enables the defi nition of the relative value of commodities and its evolution, the evolution of prices, and their value in terms of purchasing power. It shows who is buying what, cash and commodity fl ows, supply and demand related to basic commodities (that is, commodities the demand for which is rather inelastic 30 ). The investigation and monitoring of market trends involves recording the following at regular intervals:\n9 the price of the main essential commodities; 9 salaries in kind or cash for the main occupations; 9 offi cial and unoffi cial (i.e. informal) local currency exchange rates for the most commonly used foreign currency; 9 infl ation rates (if possible), which reveal real price fl uctuations. Market data collection must not be passive and confi ned to recording and processing prices at regular intervals."
