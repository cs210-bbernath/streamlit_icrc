"various kinds, ranging from the simplest to the most complex. 18 The basic measures of variability are:\n. the mean deviation: the sum of the individual deviations (ignoring negative or positive signs) divided by the number of observations;\n. the variance: the sum of the squares of individual deviations divided by the number of observations; 19 . the standard deviation: the square root of the variance. 20 Calculating the standard deviation is pointless unless it will lead to practical applications. The mean and the standard deviation represented on a Gaussian curve produce the following result:\n. 68% of the individual values are situated within the limits constituted by the mean and +1 standard deviation."
