"2. The States Parties to the present Covenant, recognizing the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, shall take, individually and through international cooperation, the measures, including specifi c programmes, which are needed: a) to improve methods of production, conservation and distribution of food by making full use of technical and scientifi c knowledge, by disseminating knowledge of the principles of nutrition and by developing or reforming agrarian systems in such a way as to achieve the most effi cient development and utilization of natural resources; b) taking into account the problems of both food-importing and food-exporting countries, to ensure an equitable distribution of world food supplies in relation to need.\"\n\n# OTHER LEGAL INSTRUMENTS GOVERNING HUMAN RIGHTS\nMany legal provisions forbid all form of discrimination based on race, employment, occupation, pay and sex (United Nations, 2002). The many other international human rights instruments should, in combination with those discussed above and provided they are observed and applied, avert or at least mitigate nutritional crisis arising from abuse. # INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW\n9 Article 14 of Protocol II of 1977 Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 states: \"Starvation of civilians as a method of combat is prohibited.\" (see also article 54, paragraph 1, of Protocol I of 1977 Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949); 9 Article 54, paragraph 2 of Protocol I states: \"It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works, for the specifi c purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse Party, whatever the motive, whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to move away, or for any other motive.\" (see also article 14 of Protocol II); 9 Article 17, paragraph 1, of Protocol II states: \"The displacement of the civilian population shall not be ordered for reasons related to the confl ict unless the security of the civilians involved or imperative military reasons so demand. Should such displacements have to be carried out, all possible measures shall be taken in order that the civilian population may be received under satisfactory conditions of shelter, hygiene, health, safety and nutrition.\" 9 By virtue of articles 70 of Protocol I and 18, paragraph 2, of Protocol II, it is the duty of the High Contracting Parties to consent to relief actions for the civilian population which are of an exclusively humanitarian and impartial nature and which are conducted without any adverse distinction."
