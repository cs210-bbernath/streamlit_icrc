"proportion sought: 50%\n. degree of accuracy: 10%\n. confidence level: 95% the result will be a sample size of 96. 31 This is based on the following two formulas. For means: 32 The size of a sample for an infinite population may be calculated with the formulas studied above, with due consideration to the parameters of accuracy and confidence. The value found will serve next for the calculation of the size of a sample representing a finite population. n = z 2 (x) s 2 d 2 (+) z 2 s 2 N For proportions: n = z 2 (x) pq = d 2 + z 2 pq N\n\n# Calculating the Size of a Sample to Find a Proportion by Simple Random Sampling\nEstimate of prevalence sought (when in doubt, take 50%, which will make the sample as large as possible) Cluster sampling is known to be less accurate than simple random sampling, but this disadvantage can be offset by increasing the size of the sample. Experience has shown that doubling the sample size necessary for simple random sampling is sufficient to compensate for the statistical approximativeness inherent in cluster sampling. 33 In the case given above, the size of the sample in cluster sampling would be 96 x 2 = 192. N = Z 2 pq D 2 q = 1 -p\nThe minimum number of clusters must be 30. The size of the population from which the sample is drawn is in fact not very important, and it may not even be known. For a given sample size, it is better to choose a large number of clusters and a small number of individuals in each cluster rather than the contrary. 34 In our example, 7 children (6.4 rounded off to 7) will be examined in each cluster, giving a final total of 210 children. 35 Let us take the example of measuring the prevalence of malnutrition in famine-stricken areas, with the following parameters:\n-confidence level = 95%; -estimated prevalence of <80% weight-for-height = 20%; -confidence limits = +5%. n = Z 2 (p) (1 -q) (DEFF)\n\n# N = Z 2 pq D 2\nA total of 400 children would have to be included in the study -either 30 clusters of 14 children or 50 clusters of 8 children. Increasing the number of subjects in each cluster will not significantly increase the accuracy of the results; 36 it is preferable to increase the number of clusters."
