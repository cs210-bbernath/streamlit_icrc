"taken, but 99% can be taken as a confidence level. In this case, the number of standard errors must be altered (2.54 for 99%). \n# Distribution of Means of Repeated Samples Taken within the Same Population\nThe average of the means found in repeated samples of the same population is equal to the true mean the global value of d is estimated -that is, the sample must be large enough so that at 95% the value found by sampling is sure to fall +d from the true mean. \n# & Value of the variable:\nThe last concept involved in calculating sample size is the value of the variable sought."
