Degre\u00b4mont, ''The term therapeutic procedure means not only surgical action or the prescription of medicines, but also the decision to transfer the patient to another, more suitable health center, or else to abstain from intervention because it is useless or impossible.'' 23 The standardization process is carried out on several levels. \n# Standardization of Treatment\nIn emergency situations, the use of biological tests and x-rays remains the exception. This restriction must be kept in mind when a course of treatment is planned. Standardized treatment should be the rule at all levels of the medical hierarchy (CHWs, nursing personnel, doctors): ''A vertical coordination must be achieved between the different standardization plans, to make sure they complement each other.'' 24 In this book, however, the emphasis is on the therapeutic tasks that the CHWs may need to carry out in a given context."
