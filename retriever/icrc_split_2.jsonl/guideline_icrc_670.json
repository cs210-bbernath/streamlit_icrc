"Data Is the information sought pertinent in an emergency situation? The mortality rate is; but the rate of prevalence of intestinal parasitic infestations, in contrast, is not, at least not in the initial phase of the emergency. An intervention to control intestinal parasitic infestations will not have a dramatic impact on reducing mortality, and other information is more important at this stage (diarrheal diseases, malaria, etc.). Nonetheless, after the initial phase the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infestations can become a significant element in studies on the impact of sanitation programs. \n# Adequacy of Data Collected to Describe the Situation Objectively\nIn an emergency situation, the main difficulties are to obtain information from all the population groups concerned (access to information) and to obtain reliable responses in a conflict situation (reliability of information)."
