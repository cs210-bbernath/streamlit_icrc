"4. Malnourished individuals or those at risk must temporarily be targeted, until such a time as the entire population can be assisted in the form of take-away GFD rations; alternatively, only the malnourished must be targeted because most of the population can feed itself independently; in such cases however, operating agencies must be certain that the situation is unlikely to deteriorate because if it does, this can give rise to serious negative effects, such as those observed where supplementary feeding programmes target the malnourished without a proper GFD to ensure adequate food access for the overall population. Provided that some conditions are met, soup kitchens nevertheless have clear advantages:\n9 benefi ciary diet is easy to control; 9 depending on admission criteria, they can be very useful in targeting the most destitute; 9 they permit direct contact with the affected population; 9 they facilitate the identifi cation of the sick and severely malnourished, which may then be referred to hospitals and therapeutic feeding centres accordingly;\n3.
