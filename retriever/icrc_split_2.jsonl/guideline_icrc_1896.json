"The following recommendations are a practical alternative to strict calculations in the case of protein complements other than legumes, and the results nevertheless lie within dietetically-safe brackets. 9 Fresh peanuts: 100 g to complement cereals, or 350 g to complement tubers. If they complement tubers, peanuts become the staple food by supplying the greatest proportion of energy; their cost and availability however may restrict their appropriateness in some circumstances. 9 Dried peanuts: 60 g to complement cereals, or 200 g to complement tubers. Like fresh peanuts, they become the staple food in the case of tubers. 9 Nuts: 100 g to complement cereals. They are not useful to complement tubers, as this would involve consuming 350 g of nuts, which would amount to 90% of the overall energy content of the ration; in that case, the tubers would become the energy complement to the nuts. This is however sometimes the case, for example in southern Africa, where the mongongo nut is sometimes the staple food. a Bambara nut is also a protein complement."
