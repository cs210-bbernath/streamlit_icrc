"4 g of potassium chloride (KCI, 2 g/l) (MSF, 1995). The rehydration process must be slower in case of severe malnutrition than in the absence of malnutrition: between 70 and 100 ml of ReSoMal per kg of body weight is usually enough to restore normal hydration (WHO, 1999). This amount should be spoon-fed regularly over 12 hours in 5 ml doses (i.e. the approximate capacity of a standard teaspoon); it can also be instilled through a syringe that is gently inserted into the corner of the mouth. The total volume depends on body weight; however the individual dose and the overall duration of the process do not vary."
