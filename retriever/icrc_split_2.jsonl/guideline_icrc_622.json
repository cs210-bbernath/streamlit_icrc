"made using tests adapted to the data-collection method (significance tests). \n# Measures of Central Tendency\nCentral tendency is calculated in the form of a mean. It defines the median axis around which are gathered the set of individual values in the population studied. The median of a set of observations is the value located ''physically'' in the middle of the set. The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a set of observations. \n# Applications in Emergency Situations\nEmergency situations are no different from normal situations as regards choosing an index of central tendency.
