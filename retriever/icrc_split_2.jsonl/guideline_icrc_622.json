"it must be clear enough so that decision-makers can interpret the data quickly. # Incidence and Prevalence\nThe incidence of a disease is the number of cases occurring during a given period of time, while the prevalence of a disease is the number of cases present at a particular moment or period. The concept of incidence is important in the investigation of an epidemic, for the number of new cases per unit of time (days, weeks) gives some idea of the spread of the disease. The concept of prevalence is important for diseases of long duration, such as tuberculosis. It indicates the total number of patients during a given period (new cases plus cases that began before the period studied but which continue to develop during that period)."
