"storage (and, thus, sedimentation) reservoir that contains the untreated water. The second is a fi lter, and the third is a purifi er. As indicated above, passive or active sedimentation must be performed before fi ltration according to water turbidity. Purifi cation describes a chemical or thermal treatment that kills germs. Chemical purifi cation with chlorine is the most common method; it must be performed by an expert, and this Manual therefore limits itself to only describing its principle. The different chemicals used for chlorine purifi cation are distinguished according to their specifi c active chlorine concentrations. This concentration must therefore be allowed for in order to achieve a given concentration of chlorine in the water."
