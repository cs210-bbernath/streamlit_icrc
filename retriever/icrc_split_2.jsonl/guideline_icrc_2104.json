"It follows that poor practice is by no means a major cause of the nutritional problems that are common outside crisis situations. Gillespie and Mason provide the following remarks on this issue: \"Signifi cant progress can only be made through action that addresses resource constraints. Nutritional education can nevertheless have signifi cant impact when clear changes occur, such as migration to cities, or the transformation of resource production modes. Nutritional education can also be effective when resources are not a constraint and the population is open to suggestions of improved practices. However, the following questions must be answered at this stage: The only objective of nutritional information is to change individual behaviour by improving knowledge and motivation. It must not entail a signifi cant increase of expenditure and effort because crisis already complicates the coverage of unavoidable expenditure; crisis also often precludes additional effort on the part of its victims owing to lack of time, fatigue, and other more pressing priorities. Nutritional information can only succeed if behavioural change (which requires little additional investment) is expected to improve the nutritional situation rapidly. The remaining issue requiring clarifi cation is whether the programme should address primarily those responsible for poor practice, or extend to the entire community from the outset. If malnutrition has multiple causes, it can for example be implemented fi rst within feeding centres and healthcare facilities; if it is successful, its extension can then be attempted. It may nevertheless be best to target the entire community from the outset if poor practice appears to be general and is feared to have serious consequences."
