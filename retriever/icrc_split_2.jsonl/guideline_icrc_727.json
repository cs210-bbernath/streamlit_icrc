"additional source of stress for the physiologically most vulnerable groups. Theoretically, then, it is at the moment when the EWSs begin to produce signs of agricultural and economic crises that aid interventions should be planned. The implementation of this principle, however, is hindered by several obstacles:\n\n# Indicator unreliability\nLocally recorded agronomical indicators are fairly reliable, but give a geographically limited view of the scope of the problem. In contrast, a satellite picture of the region gives an overall view, but does not lend itself to accurate analysis. \n# Lack of resources\nAnticipating disasters is not high on governments' priority lists; they prefer to focus resources on programs that have an immediate impact, rather than on EWSs, the utility of which is less obvious."
