"In June 1985, approximately 40% of the children in the Ethiopian region of Tigre rated lower than 80% of the weight-for-height reference. All required intensive care in therapeutic feeding centres to some extent, and morbidity and mortality were quite high in such centres. At the same moment on the desert fringe in Eritrea, similar prevalence rates were recorded in children, but only very few required intensive care. The difference is explained by the fact that, in Tigre, nutritional status was estimated according to weight, and commonly overestimated because of parasite infection; the combination of such infections (and others) with malnutrition had serious consequences on health. These problems were signifi cantly diminished in Eritrea."
