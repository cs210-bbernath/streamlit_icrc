"two different populations -although always with some probability of error. The computation of this probability will depend on the value of t and the degree of freedom. Tables are available for this. Thus, where t = 2.179 and the degree of freedom = 12, the probability of error is 5%, when the two populations are different. If the degree of freedom is 21 and t = 3.819, the probability of error is 1/1,000. \n# The p Value\nEpidemiological studies refer to the p value, which is ''the probability of obtaining, by pure chance, a difference greater than or equal to the one observed.'' 43 The norm is not to accept p values higher than 0.05 (5% risk of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true)."
