"by this method, the exercise may be repeated as necessary. The method may be fi ne-tuned by selecting the fi rst subject in a given direction; this involves counting all subjects in that direction, and then observing them according to a given interval. Simple random sampling is often referred to as \"two-stage sampling\": the fi rst stage is the selection of clusters, and the second is the selection of subjects within clusters. Systematic random sampling involves three stages: the fi rst is the identifi cation of sub-sections, the second is the identifi cation of clusters within the sub-sections, and the third is the selection of subjects within the clusters."
