"war, which can be analyzed from two points of view. \n# CONCLUSION\nFor war victims, health most often means survival, which in turn depends on access to those essentials of life which are food, water and medical care. In many cases this access is a challenge that people already have to meet every day in time of peace. In time of war, the lack of security and the political interests involved can suddenly make the search for the basic essentials vastly more complicated. War does not affect just people; the damage done to the economic sector (agriculture in particular) and the social sector (degradation and even destruction of health systems) has an immediate effect on the population."
