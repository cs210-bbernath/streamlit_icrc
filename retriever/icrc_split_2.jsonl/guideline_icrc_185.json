"Ways of developing the existing system and creating new means of subsistence will be dealt with in Chapter 8 (''Disasters and Development''). # Principles\nThe agricultural systems of developing countries are particularly vulnerable to adversity, whether ecological (drought) or political (conflicts). The consequences of such occurrences are often numerous and intermixed; here we will merely touch on the most visible problems for which rehabilitation solutions exist. # Seeds\nLack of seeds may prevent the resumption of farming. In this case, the distribution of seeds suitable for local conditions is enough to re-establish agricultural production. # Cattle\nIn very serious crises, draft animals may have been slaughtered or sold in order to buy food. Replacing the cattle helps get agricultural activity restarted. 76 This is the recognized chronic aid recipients' syndrome, in which beneficiaries come to expect humanitarian organizations to guarantee them long-term food aid. 77 Article 14 of Protocol II additional to the Geneva Conventions provides a basis in law for this kind of protection."
