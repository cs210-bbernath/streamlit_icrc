"In this case, however, registration teams move along the rows. They give each family head a GFD benefi ciary card; teams record the card reference number and the number of family members included in the card in ledgers (or in scrap-books that will later be transcribed into central ledgers); once all the cards have been distributed in this way, registration teams know the exact number of registered families and individuals. In this process, the population remains immobile during the entire registration process, and this may avoid much disorder. Only when all the cards have been distributed does the registered population proceed to the next attention points, where names and other necessary information are fi nalized in the central ledgers; this second stage may even occur at a later date, in smaller groups. As mentioned earlier, some means must be found to assist hardship cases in consultation with local authorities."
