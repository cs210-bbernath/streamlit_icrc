"Critical external factors are uncertainties that arise during the operation; those implementing the operation have little or no control over them, and their impact on its implementation and, thus, its success can be signifi cant. They amount to the various assumptions regarding developments in the situation, possible constraints, the risks involved in implementing the operation, and its possible negative side effects. Clearly, if the defi nition of critical external factors raises doubts as to its feasibility, then objectives have been set poorly. In such cases, the entire planning process must be revisited. # PLANNING ACTIVITIES AND RESOURCES\nPlanning consists in defi ning what activities must be implemented, their precise combinations, in order to achieve specifi c objectives; it also sets their timing. This effort amounts to operational tactics, which must not be confused with the overall strategy. The strategy sets the combination and coordination of the different operational measures in order to achieve an overall objective; the tactics on the other hand are subjected to the strategy and permit the practical implementation of the necessary measures, as dictated by the need for assistance and the context-specifi c constraints and opportunities. Resource planning consists in the qualitative and quantitative defi nition of the human, material, logistical and fi nancial inputs that are necessary for the operation to satisfy the need for assistance, in line with set priorities and objectives, and planned activities. # PLANNING RESOURCE MOBILIZATION\nPlanning the mobilization of resources consists of determining appropriate:\n9 headhunting: how to fi nd and employ skilled staff; 9 procurement: how to secure the necessary material and logistical resources; 9 donor relations: how to select and approach donors in order to secure funding and in-kind donations; 9 timing: the best timeframe for the availability and use of resources. # ALLOWING FOR ADJUSTMENT\nIt may seem strange to allow for adjustment; this aspect, in spite of being the corollary of monitoring and evaluation, is frequently overlooked because of routine and/or because the history of past experiences is lost, and adapting an operation usually entails costs in terms of resources and additional effort."
