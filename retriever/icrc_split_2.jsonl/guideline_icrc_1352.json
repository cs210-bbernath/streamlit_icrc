"to supervise the practical implementation of the operation if relevant. In terms of nutritional monitoring, assessment rests upon pre-defi ned indicators, and takes place according to a plan that allows for events that may affect the different stages of the feeding process. It includes balance studies at regular intervals (or compliant with critical stages), in order to use the resulting data. 11 The difference between monitoring and follow-up lies in the fact that monitoring refers to the overall process, whereas follow-up refers to a specifi c activity. The follow-up of the nutritional status is part of nutritional monitoring. Programme follow-up involves the supervision of its implementation according to the initial plan."
