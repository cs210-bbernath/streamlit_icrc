"# What will be done ? To decide what should be done, planners must take note of existing norms and the constraints of the situation. This will allow them to define the limits of what can realistically be attempted -in other words, to set objectives. The decision to take action takes an analysis of the political and health situation (pre-crisis, acute crisis, chronic crisis or transition) into account. Mortality and morbidity rates have been ascertained by the assessment and are our first priority."
