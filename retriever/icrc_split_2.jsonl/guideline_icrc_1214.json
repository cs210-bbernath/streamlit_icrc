"little chance of imposing views on local or national authorities. However, combining efforts with the military is rarely an option in humanitarian action because of the principle of independence. Humanitarian action must therefore convince authorities of the need for their action, especially when neutrality is an issue. Persuasion is complicated by the serious risk of abuse and the diversion of aid, and dialogue must serve to achieve set goals and ensure staff security. On the other hand, abstention is preferable to doubtful compromises that only address underlying problems temporarily, and aggravate them ultimately. Unfortunately, political constraints are often quoted, as is \"emergency\", in order to justify anything."
