"The themes of Chapter XV -Nutritional information nutritional information 5.2 Feeding infants and small children\n\n# Weaning\nIn relation to food consumption, Chapter VI discusses weaning as the crucial stage in the survival and development of infants. Poor practice during this phase can have disastrous consequences. # Poor practice\nThe mortality associated with weaning can be very high, owing to the following factors:\n9 local habits can involve abrupt weaning that causes emotional shock in the child, and serious health risks if its food is inadequate and contaminated by infectious agents; 9 varied and high-energy density foods are not always available or affordable; 9 knowledge of good practice is lacking; 9 hygiene is often sub-optimal, and it may be diffi cult to improve owing to lack of means and/or ignorance; 9 healthcare services are insuffi cient or inaccessible (distance, limited resources); 9 the care given by the mother to her child may be inadequate -time constraints and the lack of means are usually more to blame than ignorance. All these reasons promote the development of infection, malnutrition, and their combination; in economic crisis and famine, these factors deteriorate. Nutritional information intended to improve weaning practices relates to the following:\n9 the duration and role of breastfeeding during the weaning process; 9 weaning foods; 9 the administration of meals; 9 the observance of food hygiene rules; 11 9 the quality of attention (watchfulness as to health problems). Most of the following considerations are inspired by Cameron and Hofvander (Cameron & Hofvander, 1983). # The transition between breastfeeding and weaning\nIn smooth breastfeeding conditions, the weaning process should begin at 4 months at the earliest, 6 months at the latest. Some societies begin it during the second month already. Moreover, occupational constraints and changing living conditions can cause mothers to adopt weaning practices that are not cultural but rather result from forced adaptation to new parameters. This subject must be understood properly before advising mothers."
