"tools that can help in analysing and/or reporting important information. These visual supports are generally easier to read and understand than a long text/explanation. \n# Diagram of interactions\nThe diagram of interactions shows the relationships (power and solidarity) between a given group of people and other stakeholders. You can either create the diagram directly with the people you are interviewing or collect all the information first and recreate the diagram afterwards. This can serve as an excellent annex to a report. Place the category of people of interest in a circle in the middle of the diagram. Then add a circle for each stakeholder, sized and positioned according to its importance/influence."
