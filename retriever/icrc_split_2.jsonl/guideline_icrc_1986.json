"Assessment 4. Assessment tools 4.4 Nutritional anthropometry\n\n# Height-for-age\nAdvantages: a good indicator of past nutritional and health disorders that result in growth retardation. Drawbacks: of little use for programme monitoring, because height progresses slowly in humans; the method requires two different techniques: reclining position for children below 2 years old and standing position for older children, when the two categories must be measured simultaneously (which is usually the case); height is not easy to measure accurately; it requires the participation of two persons; it requires accuracy in setting age, which is usually diffi cult to ensure. # Conventional cut-off points and Waterlow classifi cation:\n9 > 95% or > -1 Z-score: adequate growth 9 94 to 90% or < -1 Z-score to -2 Z-scores: mild growth retardation 9 89 to 85% or < -2 Z-scores to -3 Z-scores: moderate growth retardation 9 < 85% or < -3 Z-scores: severe growth retardation. # Weight-for-height\nAdvantages: a good indicator of wasting, regardless of age."
