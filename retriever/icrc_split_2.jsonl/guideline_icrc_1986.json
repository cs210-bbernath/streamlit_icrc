"are inadequate -the risk of negative side effects is greatest. All the more so because some humanitarian agencies view SFPs as an almost standard response to inadequate basic rations, which translate into more or less serious malnutrition. Thus the rationale for SFPs in crisis is usually observed malnutrition rates and insuffi cient access to food for the majority of victims. This however is a double paradox. The more adequate the access to food, the lower malnutrition is, and the less relevant an SFP becomes; the greater restrictions to access, the more SFPs become the obvious choice in an attempt to mitigate damage."
