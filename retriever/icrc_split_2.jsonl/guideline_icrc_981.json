"# Program Evaluation\nEvaluation consists in measuring the performances of an intervention program. It is also, however, a kind of steering device for the intervention itself. There are two levels of evaluation: monitoring and impact evaluation\n\n# Monitoring\n\n# Monitoring the Aid Provided to the Victims\nThe aid provided to the victims can be monitored in different ways. The humanitarian agencies can ascertain whether the victims indeed have access to routine services (health, water, law, etc.), or they can verify that the supply distributions (food, drugs) that they finance or provide do indeed get to the victims who need them. All humanitarian agencies accept the necessity of monitoring aid. This is why some of them, including the ICRC, make the assistance they provide conditional on their being allowed to supervise it themselves: ''When emergency assistance is required and the ICRC is particularly well placed to play a useful role by virtue of its specific mandate, it sets three conditions before undertaking any relief action, namely that it be allowed access to the persons requiring assistance, to observe their situation and to evaluate their needs; that it be present when the aid is brought in; and, finally, that it be allowed to exercise administrative supervision in order to prepare reports on distributions made.'' 10\nIf the authorities will not give advance consent to the monitoring of humanitarian assistance, the humanitarian agencies can either withhold assistance until they receive a guarantee that they will be able to supervise it, or provide the aid in the hope that the authorities will eventually yield. The crucial point here is how urgent the victims' needs are. If the situation is critical, postponing humanitarian assistance is ethically questionable. If conditions are less drastic, it is then possible to temporize while trying to obtain permission to supervise the operation. In the time required to conduct such negotiations, however, the victims' condition may deteriorate dramatically, and the humanitarian agency again faces the same problem, now compounded by the accusation that it did not act early enough to prevent the crisis. This type of situation is, unfortunately, not uncommon. Consequently, relief agencies must take into account both the necessity of supervision and the importance of not penalizing the victims who need the aid. # Evaluating the Impact of the Intervention on the Victims\nThe inputs mobilized should furnish a certain number of services, such as medical examinations, food distributions, and surgical interventions. Evaluation is a means of verifying whether the services provided correspond to what had been anticipated quantitatively and qualitatively."
