"I Draw a line and pinpoint two or three important events that have occurred within living memory. Place them in chronological order on the line. I Explain that the objective is to fill in the gaps on this line with other past events. I Ask people to recall significant events of the past (both positive and negative) and when they happened in relation to the other events already identified."
