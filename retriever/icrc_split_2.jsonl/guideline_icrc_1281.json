Results obtained by the other participants are then discussed in detail, and workers repeat their measurements while the operator comments and corrects mistakes as they arise. Ultimately, each participating worker should produce at least fi ve successive results within 1 mm or 100 g of the reference value in the case of MUAC or weight; in the case of height, accuracy must be of the order of \u00b1 0.5 cm ."
