"on the daily life of society, according to cultural standards. \n# Cost of the action\nThe goods and services are provided free of charge, because recipients are assumed to be completely destitute at the time of implementation. Financial contribution is the rule, mainly for recipients to contribute to decisionmaking and ensure ownership (if not, they do not participate). \n# Interaction with offi cials\nInitiative, even interference, is tolerated because substitution is obligatory, and because the end is thought to justify the means (rightly or wrongly). Development operations are doomed to failure without the direct participation of local authorities and society."
