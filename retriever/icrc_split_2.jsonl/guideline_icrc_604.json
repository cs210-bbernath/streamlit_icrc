"individual declared positive by the test actually has the disease. \n# Implications for Emergency Situations\nIn a region heavily infested with malaria, there is a danger that anyone showing up at the local clinic with a headache will be considered to be suffering an attack of malaria, if the indicator sought is the patient's complaint of ''headaches.'' For greater exactitude, a more specific indicator must be used, such as fever (measured with a thermometer) and a positive blood test (analyzed in the laboratory). 10 The first indicator covers most cases of malaria and is therefore highly sensitive, but a number of cases thereby labeled as ''malaria'' are not actually malaria, meaning that this indicator has a weak positive predictive value."
