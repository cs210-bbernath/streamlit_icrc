"A test is available for the effective measurement of the indicator. # Relevance to the Factors to Be Measured\nIn situations where access to food is cut off, the rate of severe malnutrition should be measured as a way of assessing the urgency of the nutritional situation. This variable must be further refined, however; the aim must be to measure specifically the rate of severe, acute malnutrition of recent appearance, not the total rate, which includes both acute and chronic (associated with growth retardation) malnutrition. # Possibility of Defining the Indicator Precisely\nIndicators must be defined precisely and unequivocally for data collectors in the field."
