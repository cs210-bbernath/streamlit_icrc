"for catch-up and maintenance only supply 75 g of protein. Protein is therefore slightly limiting, and catch-up will only reach up to 4.5 g/kg/day. The same calculation applied to a man initially weighing 50 kg leads roughly to the same result, in which protein is slightly limiting. If catch-up is less ambitious and is limited to 2 g/kg/day, then protein is no longer limiting. In other words, protein may limit the nutritional catch-up rate in adults; in small children, however, the nutritional catch-up rate is usually only limited by energy because their protein maintenance requirements are lower with respect to energy 3."
