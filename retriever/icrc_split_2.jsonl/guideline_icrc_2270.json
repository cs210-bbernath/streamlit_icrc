"g of protein/100 ml with a P/E ratio of 10%. \n# Other foods\nOther foods may also be supplied, for example to be taken home or eaten on site with or between meals. Such foods include high-energy biscuits (whose composition should be as close as possible to that of F-100 Formula), special peanut paste that is equivalent to one F-100 Formula meal (e.g. Plumpy'nut produced by Nutriset) that supplies 500 kcal (2,090 kJ) for one 92 g sachet, and fruit. Such products derive their appeal from the fact that they require no preparation or cooking. They are however dehydrated (except fresh fruit), implying that patients must be able to drink, and it is diffi cult to ascertain who has in fact consumed them."
