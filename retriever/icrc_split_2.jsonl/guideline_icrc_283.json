"may have to resort to more specific methods of control. These should not, however, take the place of basic hygiene and become ''the solution.''\n\n# Physical Intervention\nPhysical intervention may include:\n-drainage of rain water and waste water -prevention of overcrowding -use of traps designed for a specific type of vector, such as flies or rats -use of mosquito nets\n\n# Chemical Intervention\nChemical intervention involves the use of chemical products, mainly insecticides and rat poisons. These products have only a temporary effect unless they are accompanied by the measures mentioned above. Moreover, their use may be detrimental:\n-to the health of those who handle them; -to the health of beneficiaries, if the rules concerning the concentration to be used, the mode of delivery, etc., are not respected; -to long-term vector control, since in the long term improper use may lead to the development of resistant vector strains, as was the case with anopheles and DDT."
