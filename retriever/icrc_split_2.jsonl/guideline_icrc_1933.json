"2. Host governments should facilitate rapid access to disaster victims for NGHAs: if NGHAs are to act in full compliance with their humanitarian principles, they should be granted rapid and impartial access to disaster victims, for the purpose of delivering humanitarian assistance. It is the duty of the host government, as part of the exercising of sovereign responsibility, not to block such assistance, and to accept the impartial and apolitical action of NGHAs. Host governments should facilitate the rapid entry of relief staff, particularly by waiving requirements for transit, entry and exit visas, or arranging that these are rapidly granted. Governments should grant over-fl ight permission and landing rights for aircraft transporting international relief supplies and personnel, for the duration of the emergency relief phase. 3."
