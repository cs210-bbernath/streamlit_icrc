"Depending on the access to the population and its degree of concentration, it may be preferable to open several centres -or just one. # PROGRAMME EXIT CRITERIA\nAs in any other humanitarian intervention, defi ning programme modifi cation and exit criteria from the outset is essential. Where it targets groups most prone to malnutrition (i.e. a preventive approach), the SFP's exit criterion is the implementation of more effi cient preventive measures (such as GFDs, sanitation, and access to healthcare), or crisis resolution. The programme can then be adapted to address existing moderate malnutrition more speedily, or to act as a safety net. Where it targets moderately malnourished individuals (a curative approach), closing the programme is feasible when admissions have fallen below levels justifying the maintenance of the structure, either because preventive measures have proven effi cient, or because living conditions have returned to normal and there is no danger of deterioration, at least in the medium term (six months to one year). Before abruptly closing a programme, it is still possible to adapt it by reducing it. When the decision has been made to exit from the programme altogether, the continued care of residual malnutrition cases by health facilities remaining in place must be guaranteed. # Ration distribution methods\nIn targeting individuals suffering from a confi rmed nutritional defi cit it must be possible to monitor impact and provide the required healthcare. As a result, benefi ciaries must be admitted to an SFP centre where they eat their meals and benefi t from medical care (these centres are described in Section 2.2 below). Demanding of benefi ciaries that they be present on a daily basis may seem extreme, but nevertheless derives from two imperatives combined to counter the negative side effects discussed above. Rations intended to be eaten at home are usually shared among family members and thus do not benefi t the malnourished individual as intended. If the ration is to be eaten on the spot, the targeted individual may receive no more at home. On the other hand, feeding benefi ciaries on the spot and enforcing daily presence yield the following benefi ts:\n9 ensuring that the benefi ciary does eat his/her supplementary ration, and closely monitoring his/her nutritional status -this in turn provides the opportunity to take additional appropriate complementary assistance steps, to determine whether the child is fed at home, and to be in a position to intervene if it is not (or insuffi ciently so); 9 limiting the deliberate starvation of children to have them included in the programmeeating meals on the spot is time-consuming, and thus discourages this practice to some extent. # Benefi ciary selection\nThis should occur at the entry point of and outside the centre, after having explained the latter's existence and objectives to the population."
