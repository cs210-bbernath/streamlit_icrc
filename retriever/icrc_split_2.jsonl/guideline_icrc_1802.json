However, this usually entails a number of complications: complete disorder at mealtimes, upsetting logistics plans, and the risk of lapses in proportion to the magnitude of needs. It is therefore best to set criteria for admission from the outset, and these can be combined: obvious clinical malnutrition, age groups, lists of destitute families produced in some way, etc. Criteria must be applied identically to all kitchens that are included in the programme. Clearly, declared malnutrition is an appealing criterion because it is undisputable and limits admissions, but it does not avoid malnutrition."
