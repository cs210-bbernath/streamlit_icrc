"In certain circumstances, changes in the operational situation and/or a very large provision of certain items by donors may lead to a situation where it is desirable for the effective management of the operation, to exchange requested food items provided in abundance for others which are in scarce supply. In this case, q the National Society/ICRC/League must consult with donors before making any exchanges; q care must be taken by the National Society/ICRC/League to avoid situations where exchanged food items become available for sale or are distributed to groups other than needy civilians and re-bagging should be considered; q subject to the above, donors are urged to respond positively and quickly to such requests. Excess supply or imminent expiry date is not suffi cient reason to accept cheap or free food."
