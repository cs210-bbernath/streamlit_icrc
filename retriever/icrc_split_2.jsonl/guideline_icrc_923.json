"Under no circumstances shall any person be punished for having carried out medical activities compatible with medical ethics, regardless of the person benefiting therefrom. 2. Persons engaged in medical activities shall neither be compelled to perform acts or to carry out work contrary to, nor be compelled to refrain from acts required by, the rules of medical ethics or other rules designed for the benefit of the wounded and sick, or this Protocol. 3. The professional obligations of persons engaged in medical activities regarding information which they may acquire concerning the wounded and sick under their care shall, subject to national law, be respected. 4. Subject to national law, no person engaged in medical activities may be penalized in any way for refusing or failing to give information concerning the wounded and sick who are, or who have been, under his care.'' Several points should be mentioned here:\n. Medical activities must conform to the rules of ethics. Medical personnel are bound to observe discretion, meaning both respect for medical confidentiality as such and an obligation not to inform on patients. Medical personnel act within the framework of national legislation, 23 although the principle of respecting national legislation may conflict with the principle of not informing. The prohibition on punishing someone performing a medical function for the mere fact of keeping quiet about the wounded and sick under his or her care is relative, since this measure depends on the national legislation. The protection of health-care personnel is intended to reinforce the protection of the wounded and sick. It should be noted that the rights protecting health-care personnel are inalienable: ''Members of medical personnel may in no circumstances, renounce any of the rights conferred on them by international humanitarian law  This categorical injunction is intended to prevent pressure being exerted on medical personnel to make them renounce their rights, and to preclude justification of a breach being claimed on the grounds that the victim had given its consent.'' 24 The Duties of Health-Care Personnel\nAlthough health-care personnel enjoy some degree of protection so that they can assist the victims of armed conflicts, they also have a certain number of obligations:\n. to respect the principles of medical ethics; 23 ''It refers here not only to the law in force at the start of the conflict, but also to any new legislation introduced and brought into force by a State after the start of the conflict."
