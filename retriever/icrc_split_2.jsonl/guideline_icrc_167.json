"In a study of programs in India, Somalia, Sudan, and Thailand, N. Godfrey showed that coverage was between 33% and 67% of malnourished children. 71 This approach, then, should be weighed against the system of integrating supplementary food in the general food distribution. # Supplementary Feeding\nAs defined earlier, supplementary feeding may be the basis for an NRP in cases of moderate malnutrition. Naturally, certain accessory measures will be required to increase its effectiveness: strict surveillance of the children, a survey of intrafamilial food distribution, education of mothers, and the classic measures of hygiene and public health. With certain exceptions, 72 this type of program should be integrated into the general program of food aid to families. # Specific Nutrition Rehabilitation Programs\nThere is considerable confusion in the terminology used to designate nutrition rehabilitation programs. They are often equated with therapeutic feeding centers (TFCs), which are specially conceived to implement nutrition rehabilitation programs. It is important to make a clear distinction between NRPs and TFCs."
