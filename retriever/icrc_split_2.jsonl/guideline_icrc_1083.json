"The situation can then evolve towards two extremes, with several possible combinations. In the fi rst extreme, the following aspects predominate:\n9 competition over a territorial occupation at all costs; this leads to anarchy, a waste of resources, and a bad working spirit; 9 competition to be fi rst on the spot, not bothering whether the resulting action is appropriately targeted, useful or even safe for the victims; 9 confrontation as to strategies, depending on the specifi c agendas of the different agencies and their attitude towards host authorities; this leads to confusion and the weakening of the agencies themselves when it is in the interest of the host authorities to divide and conquer; 9 inter-agency confl ict, which can arise from confusions as to mandate, but also from competition for the prime position in terms of power, visibility, and operational magnitude; 9 coercion when the major agencies that hold the resources involve implementing partners, and impose upon them whom to assist and how, as defi ned by political motivations rather than humanitarian ethics. In the other -and needless to say desirable -extreme, relationships between agencies are ethical, and then the following aspects predominate:\n9 consultation, before and during the operation, enabling all to know the intentions and means of the others, including their anticipated timeframe, and allow for this in their own planning; 9 dialogue in order to defi ne overall task attributions; 9 coordination to streamline the operations of all the agencies involved within an overall strategy, and to defi ne overall objectives that enable the optimum attribution of tasks according to each agency's skills and resources; 9 collaboration, consisting of the joint resolution of problems, involving the designation of lead agencies and complementary or support agencies for each aspect of the problems; 9 cooperation, consisting of the effi cient sharing of resources and services. Field coordination is a powerful tool in determining inter-agency relationships. It cannot be imposed, but should be freely adopted, and it must be horizontal and not vertical. Finally, the coordinating agency or person must, if possible, be chosen by the agencies involved, and must be directly involved. All too frequently, coordination structures in the fi eld are dominated by one agency or person, without them being directly involved in the fi eld operations. This must be avoided at all costs."
