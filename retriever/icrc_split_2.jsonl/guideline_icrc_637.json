"# Sampling Tools\nTo be considered representative, a sample must adhere to the rule that ''at the outset, all the subjects composing the target population must have the same probability of being included in the sample.'' 21\n\n# Types of Sampling\nVarious sampling methods are possible. & Simple random sampling: For example, a number is given to each individual, and then the numbers are chosen at random by means of a random number table . & Stratified random sampling: The population to be studied is first divided into groups according to certain characteristics: sex, area of residence, etc. Within each group, simple random sampling is carried out. & Systematic sampling: Starting with an initial, randomly chosen unit, subsequent units are selected by adding a certain number to the first unit (10, 20, 50, depending on the size of the sample relative to the total population). & Cluster sampling: The population is considered as a set of collective units, or clusters, chosen at random, after which all the subjects in these clusters are examined. This is the method that has been adopted for evaluating EPI coverage. In this application, it was calculated that 30 clusters were necessary, and that, in each cluster, it was sufficient to examine 7 children. 22 The geographical location of the clusters is determined on the basis of the sampling interval 23 and the cumulative list of the population present in each geographical location or area. A sampling frame must be constructed for each of these methods. The sampling frame may consist in a list of all subjects (simple random sampling, systematic sampling), a list of all subjects by strata (stratified sampling), or a list of all the clusters (cluster sampling). 23 The sampling interval is calculated by dividing the total population by the number of clusters provided for in the sample. The choice between the different sampling methods will depend on various considerations:\n-geographical distribution of the population -In a displaced-person camp where an entire, homogeneous population is concentrated in a restricted space, simple random sampling is adequate. If the population comprises subgroups with different characteristics (for example, ethnic or regional origin, date of arrival in the camp), stratified sampling is the method of choice. If small population groups are scattered over large areas, then cluster sampling is preferable. -cost of the evaluation -In the case of widely dispersed populations, cluster sampling is less costly than other sampling methods, since it involves less moving around. -degree of accuracy -Cluster sampling is statistically less precise than the other sampling methods. -constraints inherent in emergency situations -The sampling method should take account of such constraints as lack of time, lack of qualified personnel, and lack of access to all the population groups affected by the emergency. All this means that implementing correct sampling methods is often difficult in an emergency situation. The constraints involved give rise to distortions in the selection of subjects. If the purpose of the survey is to obtain some estimate, even a rough one, of mortality, morbidity, or malnutrition rates, the epidemiologist should take these distortions into account when analyzing the data. # Sample Size\nA sample should be as large as possible to reduce sampling errors to the minimum; it should be as small as possible to reduce the investment of operational resources to the minimum. In deciding on the right size for a sample, investigators must respect certain basic principles. & The concept of sampling error: Where the entire population is surveyed and the mean is calculated, the result obtained is the true value of the mean (Xp). If, instead, sampling is employed and the mean (Xe) is calculated from the data collected from the sample, the value obtained will deviate more or less from the true mean. If the sampling process is repeated, each time with the same number of subjects, each time a mean (Xe 1 , Xe 2 , Xe 3 , etc.) will be obtained that deviates + from the true mean (Xp). If all the values Xe 1 , Xe 2 , Xe 3 , and so forth are values representing individuals and arranged in a distribution pattern, the latter will have three main properties: 24 1. The mean (XE) obtained from the means of a series of identical samples is equal to the true mean (calculated on the basis of the entire population). 2. The standard deviation between the mean XE and the mean of each sample (Xe 1 , Xe 2 , etc.) is called the standard error. 25 3. The distribution curve of the means Xe 1 , Xe 2 , etc., is a normal distribution curve. It can be stated that 96% of the means found for a set of samples of identical size will fall between the value of the true mean and +2 standard errors. & The confidence level: Turning this reasoning around, it can be said that there is a 96% chance that the mean obtained from ONE sample will fall somewhere between +2 standard errors and the true mean. In general, this reasoning works as follows:\nWith a 95% 26 probability, the value found is sure to fall between +1.96 standard errors relative to the true mean, or, from a pessimist's point of view, there will be a 5% risk that the value found in the sample will deviate by more than two standard errors from the true value (x errors). The formula 1.96 = z (where z is the number of standard errors between the true mean and the sample mean) is important to remember, for it appears in numerous statistical calculations. & Confidence limits:\nThe confidence limits are equivalent to the degree of accuracy. This corresponds to the acceptable number of standard errors multiplied by the standard error itself:\nd = z x SE. Since SE is unknown, 25 The standard error is calculated as follows:\nStandard error = standard deviation (estimated by sample) square root of the size of the sample 26 Values under 95% are not normally taken, but 99% can be taken as a confidence level. In this case, the number of standard errors must be altered (2.54 for 99%). # Distribution of Means of Repeated Samples Taken within the Same Population\nThe average of the means found in repeated samples of the same population is equal to the true mean the global value of d is estimated -that is, the sample must be large enough so that at 95% the value found by sampling is sure to fall +d from the true mean. # & Value of the variable:\nThe last concept involved in calculating sample size is the value of the variable sought. Since this value is unknown, it is estimated on the basis of previous data. If this cannot be done, for instance when the variable is a percentage, it is estimated at 50%. # Formulas for Calculating Sample Size\nA prerequisite 27 for calculating sample size is to determine:\n. the confidence level -generally 95%, which gives a value of z = 1.96. 28\nthe degree of precision sought -expressed as d, which is the product of z (x) SE. The smaller we want the standard error to be, the bigger the sample size must be. . the value of the percentage sought. The elements needed to calculate the size of a sample 29 are obtained as follows. 1. Size of a sample to estimate a mean in the framework of a random sample of an infinite population. n = z 2 (x) SD 2 d 2\nFor a sample of n size, it is 95% certain that the value of the mean will fall between the established confidence limits. 2. Size of a sample to estimate a proportion 30 in the framework of a random sample for an infinite population. 27 These prerequisites are based on the following equation: the maximum value of the difference between the mean found in the sample and the true mean corresponds to the degree of precision established for the study. This value, d, is equal to z times the standard error (SE), or\nd = z (x) SE. The standard error is equal to the ratio between the standard deviation (SD) and the square root of the sample size (n), or SE = SD/Hn. Thus, d = z (x) SD/Hn n = z 2 (x) SD 2 d 2 28 This value can be rounded up to 2. Since z will be part of the numerator of the formula for calculating the size of a sample, the size will be slightly increased -which helps rather than hurts. 29 According to Lwanga and Tye, ''Estimating Population Values,'' in Teaching Health Statistics, pp."
