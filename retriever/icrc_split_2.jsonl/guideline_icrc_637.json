"2 , etc.) is called the standard error. 25 3. The distribution curve of the means Xe 1 , Xe 2 , etc., is a normal distribution curve. It can be stated that 96% of the means found for a set of samples of identical size will fall between the value of the true mean and +2 standard errors. & The confidence level: Turning this reasoning around, it can be said that there is a 96% chance that the mean obtained from ONE sample will fall somewhere between +2 standard errors and the true mean. In general, this reasoning works as follows:\nWith a 95% 26 probability, the value found is sure to fall between +1.96 standard errors relative to the true mean, or, from a pessimist's point of view, there will be a 5% risk that the value found in the sample will deviate by more than two standard errors from the true value (x errors)."
