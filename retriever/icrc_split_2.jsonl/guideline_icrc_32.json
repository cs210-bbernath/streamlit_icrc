"The pressure exerted by armed groups may be tremendous. We cannot set up an MHU without being aware of the killer diseases in the zone where we will be working. Drawing up a list of those diseases is an absolute priority. Strict triage criteria must be decided on by general agreement before the team travels to the site where consultations will be given. These criteria must be explained to the community concerned. # They will depend on :\n-local mortality and morbidity rates (high-priority pathologies) ; -the activities considered to be priorities ; -the resources mobilized (personnel, limited list of drugs, minor surgery or none, etc.). Patients will then be divided into four categories : 1. Serious cases : these patients need emergency attention but have a good chance of survival. Patients with secondary priority : these patients need to be examined, but the need is not urgent ; they are put on a waiting list. They are then given a consultation in order to direct them to the person who is best able to look after them."
