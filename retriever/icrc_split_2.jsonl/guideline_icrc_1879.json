"After some time, the child realizes that these new foods satiate its appetite, and accepts them without diffi culty. 12 Assuming that weaning begins at 4 months (6 months at the latest), meals that complete breastfeeding should increase from one to three or four daily within the following two months -at this stage, maternal milk is no longer suffi cient. # The energy density of weaning foods\nThe energy density of weaning foods is of little importance early in the process; this importance however increases as the child grows and breastfeeding diminishes. This progression results from the substantial energy requirements per kilogram in infants, considering that their stomach is small and that they can only be fed small amounts at a time (150 ml between 6 and 12 months old, and 200 to 300 ml between 2 and 3 years). The energy density of weaning foods must therefore be suffi cient, and this is usually only achieved by adding fats; fats must nevertheless not account for more than 30% of the energy intake. Fats also make porridges smoother, which consequently do not require the addition of water as they cool off and congeal. For example, a 12-month child weighing 10 kg, whose energy requirement is approximately 1,000 kcal (4,180 kJ), one-quarter of which is supplied by maternal milk, will need the rest to be supplied in the form of 220 g of a cereal-legume blend if no oil is added; this represents a cooked food volume of roughly 800 ml, to be fed in fi ve meals at least. The addition of oil up to 30% of the energy intake that completes breastfeeding reduces this volume to approximately 550 ml -this amount can be ingested easily in four meals. In the case of potato-legume blends, in which the potato content accounts for 75% of the calorie intake, the total volume is 1.2 litres, which should consequently be spread over eight meals. The substitution of part of the potato content with oil up to 30% of the calorie intake that completes breastfeeding reduces the total volume to approximately 800 ml, which can be fed in fi ve meals. The energy density and the frequency of meals can therefore be adjusted to feed infants. However, the administration of four to fi ve meals of approximately 150 ml each is time-consuming for the mother: at least one hour is needed to feed the child, plus the time necessary for preparation and breastfeeding (she must also interrupt her other tasks to do so). This example illustrates the need to add fats to weaning foods, and the advantage of cereals over tubers as basic foods. NUTRITION MANUAL 5. The themes of Chapter XV -Nutritional information nutritional information 5.2 Feeding infants and small children\n\n# Variety\nAs breastfeeding diminishes, the child needs more varied foods in order to satisfy its nutritional requirements. The principle is rather simple: breastfeeding should be complemented with four types of foods, as follows."
