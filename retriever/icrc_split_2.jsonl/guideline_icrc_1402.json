"Indirect distribution should therefore be seen as a last resort, when no alternative exists and the life of recipients is at stake -even in such extreme cases, the approach often fails. Direct distribution involves the use of food in two forms: take-away rations and meals to be eaten, if possible, on the spot (Section 3.5 on distribution modalities below discusses the criteria for selecting the best form). Take-away rations are delivered in the form of survival rations, parcels that contain the entire ration (and possibly other relief items), or distribution from bulk consignments (e.g. scooping). The use of parcels and survival rations simplifi es distribution, but they are more expensive and easier to steal. Similarly, planners must decide how far the delivered commodities can and should be transported."
