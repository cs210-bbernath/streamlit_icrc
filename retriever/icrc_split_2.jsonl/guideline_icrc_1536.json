Items are then compared to one another once, and informants asked to state their preference; for example, \"do you prefer item 1 or item 2?\", or \"which is more important: source 1 or source 2?\". The answer is then recorded in the corresponding box. The item, or source, that most frequently provides the answer is the most important (i.e. it has the highest priority); this permits the ranking of all items or sources by order of importance. This example is illustrated in Table 10.7 below.  In the above example, totals are as follows:\n9 production was found to be more important three times: 3 9 gathering was said to be more important twice: 2 9 purchase was said to be more important once: 1 9 and gift was not once said to be more important than another source."
