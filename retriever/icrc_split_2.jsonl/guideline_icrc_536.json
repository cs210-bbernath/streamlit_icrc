"health-care personnel will influence the profile of the curative services. If, for example, nurses are numerous, a network of relatively decentralized dispensaries can be set up. & the availability of financial resources -The decision to establish health stations directed by CHWs depends largely on financial considerations. The cost/benefit ratio of a health station is particularly high, especially where the material (drugs) and human (CHWs) resources are the responsibility of the community itself. & the geographical factor -It is necessary to estimate the size of the population these health units are supposed to cover. Thought must also be given to the distances that patients will have to travel to reach them."
