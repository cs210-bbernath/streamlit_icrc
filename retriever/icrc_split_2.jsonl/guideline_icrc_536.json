"Learning is based on demonstrations, followed by a practical apprenticeship under direct supervision. # Architectural Design of Medical Facilities\nMany plans for medical buildings are available; every book on health services presents a plan of its own. 33 Solving the facility problem consists in ''importing'' these plans, and making any changes necessary to adapt them to local conditions. Unfortunately, as alterations are added, the general appearance of the infrastructure no longer reflects a rational, comprehensive plan. 33  Without discussing construction techniques per se, this section will attempt to define the health-care personnel's contribution to the architectural design of health-care infrastructure. 34 By analyzing the activities and tasks that health-care personnel will be called upon to perform in a given facility, planners can determine how much space is needed and the best way to organize it. A dispensary's activities, for example, could be broken down as follows: \n& medical\n\n# diagnosis\n\n# treatment\n\n# follow-up\nThe clinical examination can be further broken down:\n. ask the patient to undress  \n\n# ask the patient to lie down on the examination table\nexamine the patient Delrue suggests creating a list of all the tasks that need to be done, together with the material supplies required to carry them out. Subsidiary points should be added, such as provision for the CHW to wash hands after the clinical examination and lighting arrangements."
