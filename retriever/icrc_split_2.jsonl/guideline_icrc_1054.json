"imbalance created too great, flight is the only way out. By the same token, access to health services is seriously hampered when health facilities are impossible to enter or attacks are directed against them. Security conditions are even more precarious in countries where armed conflicts have led to the disintegration of the State: the absence of responsible authorities or their loss of control over armed bands are the main factors of risk for the medical staff of humanitarian organizations. The search for innovative intervention strategies in the area of health must remain a priority for humanitarian organizations, but it must not serve as an excuse to by-pass increasingly difficult constraints."
