"Annex III : Recommendations to inter-governmental organizations 1. IGOs should recognize NGHAs, local and foreign, as valuable partners: NGHAs are willing to work with UN and other inter-governmental agencies to effect better disaster response. They do so in a spirit of partnership which respects the integrity and independence of all partners. Inter-governmental agencies must respect the independence and impartiality of the NGHAs. NGHAs should be consulted by UN agencies in the preparation of relief plans."
