"refugees are being treated in accordance with internationally recognized standards. \n# Long-Term Solutions\nThree solutions can be envisioned in the long term:\n. repatriation to the country of origin;\n. settlement in the host country;\n\n# resettlementinathirdcountry. Repatriation to the country of origin is the most sensible solution, since it restores refugees to their own sociocultural environment. Repatriation must be voluntary, and it is essential that protective measures be taken, including an assurance that the security conditions that caused the refugees to flee in the first place have been resolved, a guarantee that essential needs can be met as soon as the refugees return home (housing, food, etc.), and, finally, measures to afford refugees some possibility of finding a job again."
