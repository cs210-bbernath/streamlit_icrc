"Treatments versus Long Treatments Patient compliance is a constant problem. In emergency situations, health-care personnel face the additional problem of following up patients from migrating populations. These two factors make short treatments particularly appropriate, for several reasons:\n-Better compliance with the treatment regimen The health-care provider who administers single-dose treatments can rest assured that the patient has actually taken the medication. There are also fewer side-effects (one of the most common reasons for discontinuing treatment) -an important factor in tuberculosis, since treatment with isoniazid and thiacetazone for more than a year is badly tolerated. \n# -Reduction of the work load\nThe reduction of the health services' work load is not a negligible factor, for in an emergency, particularly its initial stages, the number of patients requiring treatment is substantial."
