"target only those that that are already in poor shape. This attitude is one of the causes that can lead to famine, and it undermines efforts to impose early warning and prevention. Humanitarian agencies must remain pragmatic and avoid being overly infl uenced by the latest trend in received wisdom. In this respect, the idea of the victims' loss of motivation because of assistance is a fi gment of bias rather than reality. In the case of limited resources, targeting must be done in close collaboration with the community under consideration in order to fi nd the best possible compromise."
