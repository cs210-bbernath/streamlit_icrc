"material support of local facilities: Local habits may be modified by reliance on outside aid, depending on the type of resources supplied. . the multisectoral approach: The institution of large-scale programs requires a major investment in personnel to cover all the sectors linked to healthagriculture, education, etc. . the ''trickle-down'' approach: Resources are given directly to the health ministry, which redistributes them; the great risk is losing control of the distribution and use of the resources. Relief agencies should work as much as possible through the local system, not only repairing or replacing weak elements (both material and human), but also proposing, if necessary, improvements in the management and organization of the facility's resources."
