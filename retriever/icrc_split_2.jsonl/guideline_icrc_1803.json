"undisputable and limits admissions, but it does not avoid malnutrition. In order to make this criterion more humane, agencies can for example admit the entire family of severely malnourished individuals if the family is known to be destitute. This approach implies that the operating agency has the means to increase admissions gradually and to open new kitchens as the situation deteriorates and existing kitchens are at maximum capacity; the upper limit is about 2,000 persons per kitchen. The task is not easy, but benefi ciaries must be identifi ed in some way. If benefi ciaries cannot be identifi ed individually by registration and nominal summoning, they must at least be identifi ed according to the kitchen that serves them."
