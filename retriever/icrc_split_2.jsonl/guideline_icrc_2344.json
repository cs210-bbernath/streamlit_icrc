"closest centimetre is indicated between brackets alongside the approximate height. The values that are rounded up to the closest centimetre and the corresponding median weight values are underlined. The 90%, 80% and 70% thresholds are only calculated for these underlined values; calculations begin at 10 years of age. This process preserves all age, height, and weight values supplied by reference tables, and thus provides comprehensive anthropometric data. This process is not strictly orthodox, but permits the evaluation of corpulence in adolescents. It is worth noting that the values provided here are close to the tables developed by Baldwin-Wood, which were converted into metric values by Jellife (Jellife, 1966)."
