"# NUTRITION MANUAL\n3. A practical approach to Chapter XI -The protection of rights the protection of rights\n\n# A PRACTICAL APPROACH TO THE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS\nThe above discussion shows that legal instruments do exist to protect the feeding system, both in peace and in times of armed confl ict. The major challenge lies in their application and enforcement, and can be addressed through three main approaches that can combine:\n9 one extreme approach involves the enforcement of law by force; 9 an intermediary approach consists of reminders or reprimands in the hope that the alleged authors of abuse will comply; 9 the other extreme involves persuasion that the observance and application of legal provisions is good, or at the very least is not counter-productive. It is not the role of humanitarian agencies to impose law by force, and they do not have the means to do so. The remaining question therefore relates to the pertinence of a forcible imposition of humanitarian action -the right for \"humanitarian intervention\"."
