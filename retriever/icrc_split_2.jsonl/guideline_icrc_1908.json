"Damaged sacks or tins should not be salvaged. Contaminated milk must not be used for human consumption. Health: the health hazards associated with indiscriminate distribution of artifi cial milks in relief actions are undocumented, but have been recognized if not recorded by relief workers for many years. Even those familiar with using artifi cial milks in normal times will face many problems in their proper preparation in disaster conditions. # Contamination\nThere is always a risk in times of disaster that the water supply will be inadequate and/or impure. Insuffi cient water can mean that containers and utensils used for mixing the milk are dirty and the milk will quickly become contaminated. Milk powder which is reconstituted with impure water will create the perfect medium for proliferation of harmful organisms. If drunk immediately after mixing, the milk is probably no more dangerous than the contaminated water, but if left for even a short time (1 hour) at \"room\" temperature, the bacteria multiply dramatically and, if consumed, can cause serious diarrhoea. Since disaster victims will almost certainly not have access to refrigeration and, since they will be loath to dispose of a half-consumed tin of evaporated or condensed milk or the remains of an undrunk cup of reconstituted milk powder, these are likely to become real health hazards. # Dilution\nChildren whose main source of food is over-diluted milk powder will inevitably become malnourished. Children who are constantly fed under-diluted milk powder can become dangerously ill as a result of the high concentration of salt. When powdered milks are distributed from large sacks it is unlikely that the recipients receive proper guidance on dilution. Such instructions are not even always written on the sacks. Instructions, written on tins of milk powder are often in an unknown language or otherwise unintelligible. Different brands/types of milk powder require different dilutions of water to one part of powder by volume."
