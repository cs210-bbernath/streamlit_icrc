"# SELECTING SUBJECTS\nValid data by defi nition must provide an accurate refl ection of reality, and this accuracy is infl uenced by how it is collected. For example, the average size of agricultural land can hardly be determined on the basis of a single visit to one farm; all the farms in the area of interest must be visited, either that or at least a certain number that is representative of the whole. In this case, strict sampling is required to ensure that selected farms are indeed representative of the whole. The same comment applies to the measurement of nutritional status, or opinion surveys as to the effects of a given phenomenon. The data is collected via a sample, or comprehensively from the entire population. Between these two extremes, it is also possible to shape an idea as soon as the information obtained for a given variable shows suffi cient convergence, be it through triangulation or repetition. But some expertise is necessary to decide whether to leave it at that or continue. # Sampling\n\n# Basic principles\nSampling is a tool for assessment that minimizes the costs and time spent collecting data by selecting a limited number of subjects within the overall population under scrutiny. However, selecting a sample must comply with a number of rules, and this may result in a lengthier process than a comprehensive survey. Here again, it is a matter of adapting to circumstances. The principle of sampling argues that information obtained on the sample should refl ect reality as accurately as possible -nothing short of a comprehensive survey will yield fully accurate results. # General aspects of assessment methods\n3.4 Selecting subjects\nThe quality of sampling rests upon three principles:\n9 the sample must be taken from a group that is as homogenous as possible with respect to the variable under scrutiny; 9 all individuals in the group must have equal probabilities of being selected for inclusion in the sample (probability sampling); 9 the result must be suffi ciently accurate. # Group homogeneity\nSampling consists in selecting individuals from a group (or \"population\") so that, by studying the features of this sample, the results may fairly be extrapolated to the group from which the sample was taken; the group must therefore be homogenous with respect to the variable, or characteristic, under consideration and to its affecting factor. For example, it would be absurd to test the hypothesis that displacement affects nutritional status by measuring -within the same sample -the nutritional status of both residents and displaced persons."
