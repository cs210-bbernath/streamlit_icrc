"determine whether it results from the absence of subjects (absenteeism). Corroboration of the feeding process and/ or renewed measurements should then establish whether the result is closer to 33% or 16% of severe malnutrition, which is, after all, a substantial difference. Whether the objective is to obtain a rough idea of severe malnutrition rates or to compare such rates with previous or future rates, the sampling error is too signifi cant for results to be simply accepted as fi nal. This example shows that complete enumeration may indeed be faster than sampling, but may also involve serious delays if its results are questionable."
