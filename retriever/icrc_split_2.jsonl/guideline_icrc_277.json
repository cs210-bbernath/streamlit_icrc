A pit latrine consists of a pit three meters deep and one meter wide, a platform (of cement, if possible) and a superstructure built with local materials. A VIP (ventilated improved pit) latrine has a ventilation system which prevents flies from gathering on the fecal matter in the pit 47 and, at the same time, reduces unpleasant odors inside the latrine. The principle and method of constructing this type of latrine are described in many sources."
