"NUTRITION MANUAL 5. The themes of Chapter XV -Nutritional information nutritional information 5.3 Diets\n\n# Fibre\nThe dietary contribution of fi bre cannot be deduced from the overall energy intake because fi bre does not contribute to the coverage of the nutritional need. Fibre is nevertheless important, because it promotes digestion, helps to eliminate cholesterol, and contributes to the prevention of intestinal disorders. It is found in vegetables, fruits, cereals, and legumes; the recommended intake is approximately 20 g of fi bre per person, per day (WHO, 2003). The fi bre content of foods is diffi cult to establish, because fi bre includes both cellulose and the parts of starch chains that cannot be degraded by digestive enzymes. Nevertheless, animal products contain no fi bre, underscoring the importance of plant products in diet. # Food group balance\nChapter V discusses the different food groups consumed by man; as a general rule, diets should comprise fi ve types of food. 1."
