This threat arises from the fact that their nutritional metabolism is at its limit, and additional complications may occur, such as water and electrolyte imbalance, infection and, less commonly, functional disorder caused by specifi c defi ciencies. Initial treatment aims at treating and preventing the direct causes of mortality in time. Practically, the following tasks are involved (ranked according to their priority). Initial treatment should not exceed a fortnight; if the above steps are not resolved within that period, then the patient is failing to respond, and death is likely to ensue."
