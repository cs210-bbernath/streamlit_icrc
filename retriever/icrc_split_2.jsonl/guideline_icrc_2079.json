"Like porridge, meals must supply between 100 and 150 kcal (420 and 630 kJ) for 100 ml, with a P/E ratio of 11 to 12%, and account for at least 1/5 of the daily food intake. # Handling of food\nMilk must be consumed immediately after its preparation, because milk contaminated by pathogens quickly becomes toxic. This is due to the following:\n9 its composition: it contains basic free nutrients that can be directly absorbed by microbes; 9 its liquid state: the Brownian motion 38 quickly scatters contaminating bacteria, not to mention the shaking of containers by preparers and consumers; 9 its consumption temperature for a long period corresponds to the optimum temperature for bacterial growth. Furthermore, it can be quickly contaminated by the pathogens that thrive in a TFC. In the tropics especially, milk grows dangerous within an hour following its reconstitution, whatever the accompanying precautions. Porridge is more resistant because it inhibits bacterial propagation, but it is nevertheless a sound culture medium and must be consumed without delay, within 2 hours following its preparation. Normal meals are even more resistant than porridge. The risk of contamination exists nonetheless, and they must therefore also be eaten soon after preparation."
