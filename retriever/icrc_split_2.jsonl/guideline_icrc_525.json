"on demonstrations, followed by a practical apprenticeship under direct supervision. \n# Architectural Design of Medical Facilities\nMany plans for medical buildings are available; every book on health services presents a plan of its own. 33 Solving the facility problem consists in ''importing'' these plans, and making any changes necessary to adapt them to local conditions. Unfortunately, as alterations are added, the general appearance of the infrastructure no longer reflects a rational, comprehensive plan. 33  Without discussing construction techniques per se, this section will attempt to define the health-care personnel's contribution to the architectural design of health-care infrastructure. 34 By analyzing the activities and tasks that health-care personnel will be called upon to perform in a given facility, planners can determine how much space is needed and the best way to organize it."
