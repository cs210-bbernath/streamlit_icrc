"1. Kitchens must have easy and suffi cient access to clean water. Options include piped supply, transport (e.g. water-trucking), catchments or wells located within the kitchen compound or in its close vicinity. In all cases, one or more tanks must be available to ensure water self-suffi ciency, and these must at least cover supply during foreseeable breakdowns; rainwater can also be collected."
