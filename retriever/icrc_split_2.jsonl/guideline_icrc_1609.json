"unbridled violence, vandalism, crime and systematic looting are common fare. Such parameters may prevent the conduct of GFD altogether, and fi eld workers must be well aware of them. Security conditions must ensure that:\n9 humanitarian staff operate without foreseeable danger; 9 GFD recipients are not endangered as a result of their inclusion, and can commute to distribution points without hindrance; 9 supply is regular enough to ensure the conduct of the GFD according to plan. As already mentioned in relation to ethics, a GFD must only be planned if funding and resources in terms of staff, infrastructure, logistics, and food is adequate, that is, that such means are suffi cient to carry it out to its completion."
