"A common mistake is to wait for all the material and infrastructure to meet arbitrary standards, when a TFC could be improvised at once with locally available means, and be improved as more substantial and advanced means become available. TFC must be planned according to its projected activities, as follows:\n9 admitting and attending to benefi ciaries and their carers; 9 accommodating benefi ciaries and their carers; 9 treating the benefi ciaries; 9 feeding benefi ciaries and possibly their carers; 9 monitoring the programme and its benefi ciaries; 9 managing and maintaining the TFC; 9 providing recreation, training, and occupation to benefi ciaries and their carers. To this end, a TFC is clearly laid out and protected from outside view by fences; it is equipped with a gate and is watched over day and night. It is best installed on a slight slope to permit the evacuation of rainwater, or equipped with adequate drainage. # Facilities\nA standard TFC includes the following facilities. 9 Shelter for the watchmen, located next to the gates and inside the compound, which enables the supervision of the entrance and its immediate vicinity. 9 A room or offi ce for registration, admissions, nutritional surveillance, and discharges. Depending on the size of the TFC, it may be best to separate the surveillance room and the admission room, in order to perform admissions, discharges, and surveillance on a daily basis. 9 An examination and treatment room, equipped with an examination bed and the necessary medical examination and care material, which must be kept under lock when not in use. The pharmacy should be located next to this examination room with direct access; this must be the only access to the pharmacy."
