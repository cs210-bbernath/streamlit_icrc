"69 Ibid. # Supplementary Feeding Strategy\nDistribution of supplementary food either alone or together with food resources for the family unit Supplementary feeding is given to vulnerable individuals at home Supplementary feeding is provided in the form of meals in centers designed for that purpose\nThe vulnerable groups are sent to the meal distribution centers\n\n# The food goes to the vulnerable groups\n\n# The vulnerable groups go to the food\nThe best strategy is to distribute supplementary food directly to the family unit, thus achieving a better coverage and avoiding the social upheaval of beneficiaries having to go to the centers. Under this system, however, there is no control over redistribution within the family."
