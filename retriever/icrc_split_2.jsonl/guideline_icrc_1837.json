"however more complicated, and involves an increased use of disinfectant. In such cases purifi cation is usually achieved by passive or active sedimentation (fl occulation with aluminium sulphate) and, to a lesser extent, by fi ltration. The method is chosen according to the type of particles present. Turbid water can also have a bad taste and discolour food (thus reducing its appeal), which should clearly be avoided in a TFC. If only turbid water is available and cannot be purifi ed, it can only be disinfected by boiling, after decantation for as long as possible, and this depends on the availability of water tanks."
