"It is not more diffi cult to measure than height or weight, but is faster. Doctor Briend considers that combining MUAC and height does not signifi cantly improve the estimation of nutritional status (Briend, 1995). Indeed, arm circumference only increases by about 1.5 cm between 1 and 5 years; in other words, the 13.5 cm cut-off point corresponds to 85% of the reference in a 1-year-old infant, and to 78% in a 5-year-old child. Drawbacks: it requires two measurements, one of which is not easy to take, and the participation of two persons. Practical improvements: the choice of two cut-off points with respect to the reference permits the construction of a height board that combines height and arm circumference and subjects may then be included in one of three categories of nutritional status: acceptable nutritional status, moderate malnutrition, and severe malnutrition. The method presents the advantage of removing the need for accurate height measurement, which saves time, human resources (two persons are no longer required), and calculations. This method is called QUAC Stick (for Quaker Arm Circumference -a team of Quakers initially developed the method during the Biafran war). 27\nConventional cut-off points and classifi cation 9 > 85% or > -2 Z-scores: 28 satisfactory nutritional status 9 85 to 75% or -2 Z-scores to -3 Z-scores: moderate malnutrition 9 < 75% or < -3 Z-scores: severe malnutrition. # MUAC\nMid-upper arm circumference changes little in children aged 1 to 5 years."
