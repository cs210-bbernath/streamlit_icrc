"must adhere to a strict and rational public health approach. \n# MHUs are a favoured strategy for vertical programmes\nA programme is described as vertical when the health personnel involved are brought in from another facility (usually one on a higher level in the health hierarchy) to dispense specific treatment. For example, a health centre may receive specialists in leishmaniasis or malaria, or a hospital may receive an ophthalmological surgeon. These vertical programmes exist alongside the existing network of health centres and hospitals. Some examples :\n-ICRC mobile surgical teams belong to this category (Somalia in 1992-1993, southern Sudan in 2000, Darfur in 2005)."
