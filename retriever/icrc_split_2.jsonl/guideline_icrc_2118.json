"After the weaning process has begun, breastfeeding continues for a duration that varies according to culture and the constraints faced by the mother. The prolonged continuation of breastfeeding (i.e. for 6 to 18 months or more) in principle guarantees the quality of dietary intake during the critical phase of weaning and exposure to infectious disease, provided that the child has access to enough other foods. Protracted breastfeeding also provides a good protection against infectious disease, and promotes the child's emotional development. The quality of maternal milk is hardly affected by her nutritional status, because milk synthesis takes precedence. Only if the mother consumes less than 1,200 kcal per day and is severely malnourished do the quality and quantity of her milk decline signifi cantly. Moreover, if the mother suffers from defi ciencies in vitamins and minerals that are not stored in the organism (especially thiamine), her milk will contain inadequate amounts, and her child will quickly develop defi ciency itself -infantile beriberi is a classic example. 8\n\n# The advantages of breastfeeding\nBesides containing all necessary nutrients (provided that the mother does not suffer from defi ciencies in vitamins and minerals), maternal milk has other advantages that cannot be matched by any other method of infant feeding. 9 Maternal milk protects against environmental bacterial and viral infection because it contains the defences that the mother herself secretes against the infectious agents to which she is exposed. It contains protection factors such as: q lactoferrin, which inhibits the attachment of bacteria to the intestinal membrane, q lysozyme, which destroys some dangerous bacteria and viruses, q interferon, which appears to inhibit the activity of some viruses, q and the so-called \"bifi d factor\" that contributes to the growth of healthy bacteria of the intestinal fl ora -these, through their growth and production of lactic acid, inhibit the growth of other bacteria and parasites. 9 Statistically, the infertility period immediately following delivery is proportional to the duration of breastfeeding; individual variations are however substantial, and breastfeeding is not a reliable contraceptive method."
