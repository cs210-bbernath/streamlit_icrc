"the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, particularly among alcoholics) (Davidson et al., 1979). \n# Wet beriberi\nAlso called cardiac beriberi, wet beriberi implies progressive cardio-vascular disorder, associated with excess pyruvate and lactic acid in the bloodstream (thiamine defi ciency impedes the transformation of pyruvate into acetyl coenzyme A). The accumulation of these metabolites appears to cause the dilatation of peripheral blood vessels, resulting in vasodilatation. At this stage, fl uid is leaking from capillary vessels, resulting in the formation of oedemas. Vasodilatation also causes an increase of the cardiac function in order to maintain blood circulation. The cardiac muscle, already weakened by the defi ciency in thiamine, must therefore produce an additional effort that causes its dilatation and failure, which accentuate oedema (this is referred to as high-output cardiac failure)."
