"also called Wernicke's encephalopathy, causes coma, resulting in high mortality. The recovery of patients treated with high thiamine doses is usually spectacular. In 1887, Korsakoff described another phenomenon affecting alcoholics; initially called \"Korsakoff 's psychosis\", its modern name is Korsakoff 's syndrome or, less commonly, \"retrograde amnesia\". Korsakoff 's syndrome manifests itself in memory loss, especially of very recent events (anteretrograde or short-term amnesia), but which may include entire periods, and an inability to learn, whereas other intellectual processes remain reasonably unharmed. In 1971, thanks to the research of Victor, it appeared that Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff 's syndrome were in fact manifestations of the same pathological disorder, related to thiamine defi ciency."
