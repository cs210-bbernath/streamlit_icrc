"This restriction must be kept in mind when a course of treatment is planned. Standardized treatment should be the rule at all levels of the medical hierarchy (CHWs, nursing personnel, doctors): ''A vertical coordination must be achieved between the different standardization plans, to make sure they complement each other.'' 24 In this book, however, the emphasis is on the therapeutic tasks that the CHWs may need to carry out in a given context. Standardization is particularly important in emergency situations. First, it should be remembered that in countries requiring relief assistance standard procedures usually already exist for treating the main pathologies, such as tuberculosis, malaria, and diarrheal diseases. Humanitarian agencies should try at the outset to standardize procedures, in order to harmonize their own emergency procedures with those employed by the health ministry. Occasionally, relief agencies may institute specific procedures which do not correspond to those advocated by the health ministry. A case in point is the introduction of short-term treatments for tuberculosis in refugee camps, when the host countries offer their own populations the conventional, long-term therapy. This problem must be negotiated with the local health authorities."
