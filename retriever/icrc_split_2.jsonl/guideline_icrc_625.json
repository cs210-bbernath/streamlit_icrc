"the limits constituted by the mean and +1 standard deviation. . 96% of the individual values are situated within the limits constituted by the mean and +2 standard deviations. If we take the example of the birth weights of a group of children where the arithmetic mean is 3 kilos and the standard deviation is 400 grams, 95% of the birth weights can be assumed to fall between 2.2 kilos and 3.8 kilos. \n# Implications for Emergency Situations\nThe standard deviation is the measure of variability most commonly used. The method of calculating the standard deviation should be properly understood, even though the EPIINFO computer program performs it automatically."
