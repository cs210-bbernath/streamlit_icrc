"The organization is largely financed by government contributions. UNHCR works in close cooperation with the other UN agencies, such as the World Food Programme and WHO, as well as with non-governmental organizations (NGOs). UNHCR has in fact begun a series of talks with the NGOs to discuss operational relations and ways of establishing a more constructive, concrete partnership. A plan of action was adopted in June, 1994, in Oslo, at the close of the PARINAC (''Partners in Action'') world conference."
