"The population gathers and splits into families at the entry point; each family is then referred to a specifi c queue according to how many members it comprises. Each queue is channelled by ropes, and leads to the card verifi cation desk (see below). The population then reports to the other attention points (where relevant, for example nutritional measurement, or vitamin A supplementation) -food distribution points must always be the last stop. Cards are verifi ed once again and perforated before benefi ciaries receive their ration; this ensures that their hands are free to receive the goods, and at the same time avoids people evading the perforation process after receiving their entitlement and then queuing for a second delivery. If food delivery is the only activity, the cards may of course then be perforated at the fi rst point of reporting. Assistants who speak the local language should be posted at entry points and should use megaphones to explain the procedure and organize queues; this is particularly useful at the beginning of the distribution in order to channel benefi ciaries."
