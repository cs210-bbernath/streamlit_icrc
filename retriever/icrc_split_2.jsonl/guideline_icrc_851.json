"Moreover, the threatened community itself must be responsible for identifying the measures that should be taken to improve the situation over the long term, and for implementing them. Finally, the common denominator of most kinds of vulnerability is human vulnerability: a deficient deductive level, absence of professional qualifications, socioeconomic habits that harm the environment. Increasing capacities in these areas offers the best chance of influencing the structural vulnerability of the economic and social systems. Looking at the disaster situations most frequently encountered, we will identify the main types of vulnerability and the capacities required to counter them, concentrating on those linked to structure rather than circumstances."
