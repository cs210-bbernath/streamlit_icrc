"wants and their ''real'' needs as defined by health-care professionals. There should be a concurrence between real needs, experienced needs (wants), and the technically and financially possible responses. In times of disaster, the effort to reconcile ''needs'' and ''wants'' is usually cut short. Humanitarian organizations tend to impose a health-care system that will cover the victims' immediate needs. This approach should not be considered as a form of humanitarian imperialism; it is dictated by the urgency of meeting the victims' vital needs, by the know-how acquired in previous crisis experience, and, especially, by the human and financial resources that the agencies are able to muster."
