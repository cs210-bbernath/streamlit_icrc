"individual households (e.g. the breadwinner is HIV positive, discrimination, etc.). Resilience is the ability to reduce, prepare for, resist and recover from shocks/hazards. A totally vulnerable household means a household without any resilience to face a shock/hazard; a household that can absorb a shock/hazard is a household with an appropriate level of resilience. The longer the shock/hazard lasts, the more the sources of income and coping mechanisms are at risk, to the point that they may all be lost. All that remains then is work capacity and even that can be weakened by hunger and failing health. When households lose their assets, they lose their means of living."
