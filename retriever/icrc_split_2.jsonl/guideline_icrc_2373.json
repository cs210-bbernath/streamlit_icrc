In such cases, water should be differentiated according to its ultimate use: water intended for cleaning (which need not be treated), and that used for consumption and treatment. Consumption water can then be disinfected by boiling it for at least 10 minutes. The water used for treatment should be purifi ed using Katadyn-type fi lters, and can then be further purifi ed with chlorine tablets intended for a given volume (1 or 5 l of fi ltered water)."
