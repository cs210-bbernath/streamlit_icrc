"Its underlying principle is always the same: to determine whether the requirement for assistance is immediate or anticipated. Such requirements arise from an imbalance between the needs that must be satisfi ed and the means available to do so, as discussed in Chapter VII and illustrated in Figure 10.1 below. # Figure 10.1 Equilibrium model between needs and means\nFirstly, some basic concepts of nutrition and crisis must be restated. The completion of the exchange of matter and energy between the organism and its environment through the feeding process satisfi es the nutritional need. For the feeding process to be effi cient, all its activities must provide suffi cient performance, according to biological and cultural determinism. In line with the three stages described in Chapter VI (the securing of food, its consumption, and its biological utilization), all the required means must therefore be available and utilized according to the standards that enable the covering of the need. Any defi cit in the means and any deviation from the standard cause an imbalance between the demands arising from the need, and the satisfying of such demands. Chapter VI showed that imbalance may be normal: in this case, it usually expresses cultural and natural variations, which are allowed for by coping mechanisms that avert harmful consequences. Sometimes, the magnitude and duration of events exceed the coping ability of security mechanisms."
