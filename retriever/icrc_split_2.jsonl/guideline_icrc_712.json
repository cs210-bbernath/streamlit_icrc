"a definition of the norms governing data collection;\n. provision of the forms on which information will be recorded (data-recording sheets in dispensaries, hospitals, etc.);\n. the establishment of mechanisms by which information will be transferred (postal service, visits to data-collection centers, telephones, fax machines, etc.);\nthe establishment of a facility to process and analyze information (epidemiological center); 64\nthe establishment of a mechanism to transmit analyses to decision-making centers and to the providers of the raw data; 65\n. the integration of new decisions in the surveillance system. The following conclusions, formulated in the wake of flooding in Khartoum in 1988, nicely sum up what can be expected of a surveillance system:\n''Simple symptom-oriented case definitions for diarrhoeal disease, measles, respiratory disease, malaria, and jaundice were included on the report form used to collect daily counts of outpatients in a sample of both temporary and permanent clinics located in areas of the city most affected by the flood. In addition, special surveys collected information unobtainable from health facilities. Sentinel clinic surveillance data indicated that diarrheal disease accounted for the greatest number of clinic visits, while malaria was the second most common reason for seeking medical attention.'' 66\n\n# Investigating an Epidemic\n\n# ''Epidemic'' Risk in Emergency Situations\nThe word ''epidemic'' is a constant of disaster situations. The first reports of such situations almost invariably speak of incipient epidemics. This myth must be eradicated once and for all: ''Epidemics do not occur spontaneously after a disaster and dead bodies will not necessarily cause catastrophic outbreaks of disease.'' 67 Some situations, of course, have indeed given rise to genuine epidemics, such as the 1964 malaria epidemic in Haiti following Hurricane Flora. The main danger of an epidemic developing, however, is attributable not to the disaster itself, but rather to the consequences of the disaster."
