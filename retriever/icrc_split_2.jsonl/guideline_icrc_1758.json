"of family units that live in the dwelling or cluster. For example, an individual may live alone (e.g. an elderly or handicapped person) but depend on a specifi c family unit for his/her food; this individual does not correspond to a family unit, but is to be included in that of the family that supplies his/her food. If, on the other hand, an individual lives alone and is fully independent, he/she amounts to a family unit and is entitled to his/her own card. As mentioned earlier, hardship cases warrant separate attention with the help of local authorities. \n# Coding example: N1/14/c\nWhere \"N1\" is neighbourhood number 1, 14 the fourteenth house registered in this neighbourhood, and \"c\" indicates that three families live under the same roof in house number 14."
