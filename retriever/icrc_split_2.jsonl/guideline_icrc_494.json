"lack of the technical means for radiological and biological tests. \n# The Diagnosis\nA diagnosis falls into one of three categories:\n& ''Symptomatic'' diagnosis Symptomatic diagnoses are made mostly at the peripheral level by nonprofessional personnel, on the basis of such symptoms as fever, cough, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. & ''Clinical'' diagnosis Several symptoms are combined to arrive at a clinical diagnosis. Such diagnoses may be relatively precise, such as diagnoses of pneumonia or infected scabies, or may be merely presumptive (fever + chills + headache = malaria 17 ). & Diagnosis confirmed by additional tests Additional tests may support a diagnosis."
