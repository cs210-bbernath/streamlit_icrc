"Breastfeeding must sometimes be interrupted (sick child or mother, absent mother); it can however always be maintained or resumed, even after some weeks. In order to stimulate milk secretion, the milk should be expressed to avoid bloating and continue stimulation. In order to reinitiate breastfeeding, the child must be fed frequently (every hour, or every second hour, for several minutes). In principle, normal breastfeeding resumes within a few days. Meanwhile, it may be necessary to feed the child supplements in the form of baby milk formula or porridge. 9."
