"demographic data and maps or sketches produced by preliminary assessments. The successive steps of census are the following. 1. Informing local authorities and securing their consent. 2. Planning census proper (i.e. method, number of individuals and teams involved, the necessary material and vehicles, location, and organization of the population) by involving community representatives who must understand the approach, take part in it, and accept its general benefi ts. If community representatives disagree, the intended benefi ciaries must be persuaded that the proposed approach is the only option, and be requested to persuade their representatives in turn. If this also fails, the relevance of the planned operation should be seriously questioned."
