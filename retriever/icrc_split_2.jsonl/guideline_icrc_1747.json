"If diarrhoea is combined with fever, the treatment for septic shock should be applied immediately. Bloody stool suggests the presence of shigellosis: this is treated for 5 days with cotrimoxazole (according to the prescription for simple marasmus provided above). If bloody diarrhoea persists for more than 2 days, the antibiotic must be replaced with one that is effective on the local shigellosis strain (WHO, 1999). If diarrhoea (bloody or not, with or without fever) persists beyond 5 days of treatment, metronidazole should be introduced (see below, parasite infections). # Viral infections\nThe worst viral infection in a TFC is measles. All children must be vaccinated against measles upon admission, and again upon their discharge (when their health and nutritional status is restored). In view of the mortality resulting from measles combined with malnutrition, the author recommends that all children between 9 months and 8 years be vaccinated. Children under 9 months are also vaccinated upon admission, bearing in mind that they must be vaccinated again when they reach 9 months. Children who have the disease upon admission must also be vaccinated and receive a vitamin A dose in addition to the routine admission dose; 29 the dose must be renewed after one week 30 because measles often causes vitamin A defi ciency, which may result in blindness and raises the 29 See Section 4.6.1 in this Chapter. # Identifying and treating other health disorders\n\n# Specifi c defi ciencies\nThese can affect the entire population, and usually do not require treatment in a TFC, unlike severe malnutrition."
