"Observations may be interpreted in two ways; they lead to the same result, but may cause confusion. q The child's actual mid-upper arm circumference is found on the left-hand scale (-2sd). If the child is shorter than the corresponding height indicated on the scale, the child is not wasted. If on the other hand, it is taller than the reference height for its MUAC, it is wasted, and the height corresponding to its MUAC value must be sought on the right-hand scale (-3sd). If the child is shorter than this reference, it is moderately wasted; if the child is taller, then it is severely wasted. q Conversely, the child's MUAC value should be located above the child's height on the left-hand scale -if this is the case, the child is not wasted. If the MUAC value is indicated below the child's actual height, then the child is wasted, and its values must be sought on the right-hand scale accordingly. If the child's MUAC value is indicated above its height, it is moderately wasted; if the child's MUAC is indicated below its height, it is severely malnourished. Thus, the QUAC stick method is an easy and fast way of distributing children into three nutritional status groups: good nutritional status, moderate wasting, and severe wasting. # Annex 15 Annex\n\n# ANNEX 15\n\n# VITAMIN AND MINERAL FORMULA FOR THERAPEUTIC FEEDING\nThis formula is based on the recommendations of Briend and Golden (Briend & Golden, 1993). The commonest commercial form is manufactured by Nutriset (therapeutic vitamin and mineral complex, CMV); 6.35 g of this powder (i.e. one dose) must be added to 2 litres of previously boiled milk for nutritional catch-up (see Chapter XIII, recipes). This process produces the equivalent of F-100 ou F-75 Formula. 6.35 g of therapeutic CMV contain:\nVitamins: vit. A (3,000 \u03bcg), vit."
