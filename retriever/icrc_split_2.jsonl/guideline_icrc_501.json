"treatments. The use of placebos in emergency situations is controversial. Some believe that in the midst of all the urgent problems demanding concrete solutions, health-care workers should not ''waste time'' on insoluble problems. Others feel that the care provider should make some response to the patient's request, if necessary with a token therapeutic gesture. There are no precise rules in this domain. Every health worker must develop his or her own philosophy in the field, in the context of the situation. The case is different with measures designed to make the patient more comfortable. A patient's suffering must be alleviated, even if lack of means precludes a satisfactory therapeutic response."
