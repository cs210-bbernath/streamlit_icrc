"It was shown that aid can be channeled directly to the victims, as in the case of food distribution, or towards services, as in the supply of drugs to local hospitals. The rehabilitation of services consists in repairing the facilities that have been damaged in the course of the disaster so that they can function as they did before. They may be reconstructed as they were before the catastrophe, or, if possible, improvements may be incorporated which reflect the lessons learned from the unfortunate experience of the disaster. For example, following an earthquake, structures may be rebuilt in accordance with anti-seismic norms. These may be considered as true development activities, designed to make populations less vulnerable to harmful phenomena in future. # Intervention Strategy in the Wake of a Disaster\nAid to victims is an essential task, and one that local resources are best suited to perform. International relief must be considered as back-up support for local mutual-aid systems."
