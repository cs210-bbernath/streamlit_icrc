"prevent suffering and not confi ne action to its alleviation. This introduces the concept that prevention is also incumbent upon humanitarian action. Chapter VII discussed the cause and effect relations that shape crisis processes; intervention criteria must now clearly be defi ned within these interrelations. Intervention should not be contingent upon malnutrition reaching epidemic proportions; on the other hand, slow soil erosion that may lead to crisis several years later probably does not justify humanitarian action. At this stage in prevention, other agencies are more competent, and should be alerted accordingly. Furthermore, the implementation of preventive action is determined by the likelihood of the situation deteriorating."
