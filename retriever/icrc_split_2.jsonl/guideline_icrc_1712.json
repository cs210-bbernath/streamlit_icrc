"In famines however, severe malnutrition is sometimes strictly primary (and practically without complication), thus reducing the intensity of initial treatment. # Hypoglycaemia and hypothermia\nHypoglycaemia and hypothermia often combine, and the fi rst precipitates the second. Both are major causes of mortality during the fi rst days following admission. # Hypoglycaemia\nHypoglycaemia is caused by an interval of more than 4 to 6 hours between meals after the inception of initial treatment, and by severe systemic infection. Its prevention clearly consists of feeding patients at an adequate frequency and/or the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics."
