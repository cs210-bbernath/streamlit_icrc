"This section will deal only with programs specifically designed to control TB in emergency situations. # Tuberculosis: Factors Influencing Severity\n- man \n\n# Reducing Transmission\nImproving living conditions (housing, hygiene) is a major factor in reducing the transmission of TB. 97 In emergency situations, it is recognized that seeking out and treating active cases of tuberculosis can reduce transmission. Primary chemoprophylaxis is used for subjects who have been in contact with active cases of TB and who are tuberculin-negative. 98 This type of intervention is not applicable in emergency situations, however. # Reinforcing Immunity\nThe efficacy of immunization with BCG has not been clearly demonstrated except for children under the age of one year, and for the control of the miliary and meningeal 99 forms of the disease. In an emergency situation, then, immunization is recommended only for that age group. # Handling Cases Presenting a Biological Reaction\nSecondary chemoprophylaxis is used for all subjects who have recently become tuberculin-positive. Here again this does not apply to emergency situations, since there is no way of knowing when the change from tuberculin-negative to positive took place, and since this measure has little impact on transmission of the disease. 100\n\n# Managing Active TB Cases\nManaging TB cases comprises four stages. 101 \n\n# Defining the Disease\nIn emergencies, a case of tuberculosis is defined as a patient presenting sputum that tests positive for TB bacilli. Diagnosis is a two-step process. 97 Tuberculosis is considered a disease of poverty. TB control in the developed countries began with improved living conditions, well before antibiotics were in use. Better housing conditions and a better diet were decisive factors. 98 In developing countries, most children have already been infected (tuberculin-positive). For example, a study carried out among Eskimos showed that 80% of children under the age of five years tested positive. 99  -Clinical diagnosis involves screening subjects who present some clinical symptom or combination of symptoms compatible with tuberculosis: cough for the last three weeks, weight loss, hemoptysis, thoracic pain, etc. Rather than trying to carry out active screening (door-to-door), health workers are advised to offer passive screening -that is, to wait until the patients come for consultation at a health-care facility. -Microscopic diagnosis involves screening patients with clinical signs of tuberculosis for positive sputum. In an emergency situation, a laboratory must be found that is able to perform this test."
