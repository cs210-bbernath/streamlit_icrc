"Its disadvantage lies in its cost, its lack of acceptability in some circumstances, its monotony, and the fact that armed groups fi nd such products especially attractive. # Supplying specifi cally fortifi ed foods\nThe distribution of fortifi ed foods is the best way of preventing specifi c defi ciencies, and is the most widely recommended accordingly. Biscuits, fl our, blended foods, groundnut paste, seasoning cubes or pastes can all be fortifi ed in micro-nutrients, according to the amounts required to complete basic rations. The best-known are corn soy blend (CSB) and Unimix, which combine cereal and legume fl ours, and are enriched in vitamins and minerals. 100 g of CSB supply 380 kcal (1,590 kJ) and 18 g of protein, and contain the following:\n9 1,700 IU of vitamin A; 9 8 mg of niacin; 9 40 mg of vitamin C; 9 0.2 mg of folic acid; 9 0.7 mg of thiamine;\n9 800 mg of calcium; 9 0.5 mg of ribofl avin; 9 3 mg of zinc; 9 4 \u03bcg of vitamin B 12 ;\n9 18 mg of iron. Practically speaking, 60 g of CSB included in food rations supply suffi cient amounts of thiamine, ribofl avin, vitamin C, and iron for all age groups -except pregnant and breastfeeding women in the case of iron (Tool, 1995). Unimix contains less of the above vitamins and minerals."
