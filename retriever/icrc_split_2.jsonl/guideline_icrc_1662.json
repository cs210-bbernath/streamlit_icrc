"Carers accompanying small children are instructed to allow the food to cool off (they may taste it) to avoid burns. Children must be made to eat without playing around or dawdling; they must however be allowed to eat peacefully -this is one operational condition for success. Inasmuch as possible, children above 2 years of age should report unaccompanied; assistants (1 for 30 benefi ciaries) are precisely required to help such benefi ciaries and give them attention and care."
