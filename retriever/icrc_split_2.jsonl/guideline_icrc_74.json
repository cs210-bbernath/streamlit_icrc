"issues or sources by order of importance (See Figure 12). \n# Figure 12 Pair-wise ranking -example of food sources\nIn the example in Figure 12, totals are as follows: I Production was found to be more important three times: 3. I Gathering was said to be more important twice: 2. I Purchase was said to be more important once: 1. I Gift was not once said to be more important than another source. In other words, the most important food source in the opinion of this group is clearly its own production, followed by gathered and then purchased foods. This group appears to rely on gifts only minimally."
