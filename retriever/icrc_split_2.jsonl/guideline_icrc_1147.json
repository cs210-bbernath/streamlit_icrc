"In order to confi rm hypotheses as to the impact of specifi c phenomena, and in order to verify how resilience activities are resorted to, the population is requested to describe the recent history that has led it from normality to its present circumstances. This is done by drafting a calendar and a detailed description of experienced phenomena and diffi culties, and the reaction they prompted. An example is provided in Table 10.2 that illustrates the development of famine between 1992 and 1994 in a region of southern Sudan. The collection of the data contained therein required a fortnight of fi eld work, involving household interviews, the measurement of the nutritional status, reference to previous reports and experience in the area, group discussions, and interviews with key informants (traditional leaders, and military and political authorities)."
