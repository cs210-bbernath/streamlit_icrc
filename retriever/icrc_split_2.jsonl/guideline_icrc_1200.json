"Monitoring and evaluation may be performed in parallel, in order to optimize the use of available means and avoid assessment activities becoming too cumbersome. # INTERMEDIARY ASSESSMENT\nIntermediary assessment is justifi ed whenever events occur that may infl uence the needs for assistance, by changing the condition of the benefi ciaries of a given operation, or by aggravating the circumstances of the previously unaffected, but monitored, population. The magnitude of the event distinguishes this type of assessment from monitoring because it changes the situation signifi cantly."
