"from the true mean, as calculated from the entire population. These sample means are distributed around the true mean so that 95% of them are within + 1.96 times the standard error (SE). This principle is the basis for the following line of reasoning. To compare a given variable in two populations, a sample must be taken in each population and compared with each other, to see whether they are similar or different. However, since these values were obtained from samples, they present a certain risk of error. In fact, a situation may arise where the true values for the two populations are similar, but the values found in the two samples deviate from each other to such a point that they are considered to be different."
