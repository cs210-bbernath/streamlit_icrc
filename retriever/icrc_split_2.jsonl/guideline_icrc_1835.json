"in camps for refugees or the displaced, and in towns. If the target population is too distant however, the TFC must include a camp to accommodate patients and their carers, or locate the TFC in a facility that permits such an addition. The permanent presence of patients and carers does not require structural changes, but does require an admission facility, preferably within the centre or in its immediate vicinity, which is fenced in and supervised, equipped with an adequate water supply and disposal system and the means required for food preparation. It is worth insisting here on the need for carers to receive adequate food rations; the comment seems obvious, but carers have all too often been seen to go without food."
