"action is determined by the likelihood of the situation deteriorating. This parameter is diffi cult to determine, not least because of the diffi culty of establishing the seriousness of the current situation itself: it may subsequently deteriorate, stabilize or improve. This quandary applies both to climatic and political developments. The resulting uncertainty sheds some light on the prudence of agencies and donors in taking preventive action; many famines have resulted from this reluctance to accept risk. Indeed, the media image of human suffering no doubt provides a stronger incentive to act than the analysis of possible economic downward trends towards impoverishment."
