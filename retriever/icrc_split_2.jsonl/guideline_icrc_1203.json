"This discussion concentrates chiefl y on preliminary appraisal, as these considerations also apply to most other types of assessment (except evaluation, which requires statistical and epidemiological analysis tools that lie outside the scope of this Manual). # A CONCEPTUAL APPROACH TO ASSESSMENT\nThe three basic concepts underlying data collection in preliminary nutritional assessment are the same as those that have been suggested for rapid rural appraisal or \"RRA\" (McCracken, 1988). # Optimal ignorance\nThis concept rests upon the idea that only the information that is strictly necessary should be sought, and no more."
