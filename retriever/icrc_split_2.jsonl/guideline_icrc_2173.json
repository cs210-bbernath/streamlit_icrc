"between the resources available to secure food and household needs. The fi gure below refl ects food availability within the household, in terms of needs and for an identical production and consumption frequency. The abscissa (or x-axis) indicates food production and the food reserves available for consumption expressed in calories; the ordinate (or y-axis) refl ects the purchasing power available to secure food on the market, expressed in monetary units. The average household calorie requirement is then estimated, and converted into its cash equivalent in local market prices, in compliance with eating habits. The resulting calorie value is indicated on the abscissa, the resulting cash value is indicated on the ordinate, and a straight line is drawn to connect them: this is the price line."
