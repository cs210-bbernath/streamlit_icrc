"a treatment that can be easily applied to large groups. Thus, specific health interventions are intended to free individuals and communities from their principal health scourges and to save the most vulnerable lives. This definition has the merit of distinguishing emergency actions from true PHC. The most common types of intervention concern the following:\n. access to food resources;\n. access to potable water;\n. waste disposal;\naccess to shelter and eventually to proper housing;\n. protection against the cold (shelter, blankets, clothes);\n. immunization;\n. measures against communicable diseases;\n. provision of essential drugs. 13 PHC and EMHIs have similar purposes: to offer populations a health status that conforms to norms reflecting local conditions."
