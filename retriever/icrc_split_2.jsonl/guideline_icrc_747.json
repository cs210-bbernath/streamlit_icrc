"Epidemiological tools are necessary in all fields: nutrition, environmental hygiene, communicable diseases, curative medicine. Moreover, their integration in the framework of epidemiological programs permits a global approach to crisis situations (initial assessment) as well as providing the opportunity to monitor crisis evolution (epidemiological surveillance). 77 Today's mentality considers ''evidence'' to be a high mortality rate. # Health Status\nThe goal of this chapter is to map out the creation of a healthcare system according to the general principles applicable in normal situations, while making allowance for the specific constraints and criteria obtaining in emergency situations. In particular, this chapter will examine the bases of health-care systems in general, as well as the similarities and differences between systems established for normal purposes and those set up for emergencies, and the relations between the two types in a given situation. # I. General Remarks\nA health-care system may be defined as the organization of health-care services in a designated geographical entity -country, province, district, or the like. A relief organization operating in an emergency situation rarely has to cover the entire national territory of a country; 1 emergency operations are usually limited to certain regions. The health-care systems used for relief operations are similar to those which normally function at the district level. Health-care systems for refugee camps are organized on the principle of geographic decentralization. The governmental authorities of the country in question delegate the responsibility for health care either to their own representatives or to a humanitarian agency or consortium of agencies. Humanitarian agencies are generally allowed enough freedom of maneuver to undertake this responsibility themselves. It should be remembered, too, that health-care systems are closely tied to the political and economic systems, particularly with respect to financing."
