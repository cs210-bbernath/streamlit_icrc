"Publications listed in the footnote references shed light on the major debate still surrounding SFPs. 9\n\n# THE OBJECTIVE OF SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING PROGRAMMES\nSupplementary feeding programmes concentrate on the following:\n9 an existing nutritional defi ciency (slight and moderate malnutrition according to the Waterlow classifi cation, 10 in children under 5 years of age); 9 an increased susceptibility to nutritional deprivation (under 5, and sick people); 9 an increased need of nutrients (pregnant and breastfeeding women, individuals suffering from specifi c medical problems, particularly the wounded or patients that have undergone a major surgical operation). These cases suggest a specifi c vulnerability to malnutrition, which SFPs aim to confront, prevent or remove altogether. When intended to confront vulnerability, SFPs are curative and target slightly or moderately malnourished individuals (i.e. targeted SFPs). When aimed at avoiding or removing vulnerability altogether, they are preventive, and directed towards the exposed group as a whole (non-targeted or blanket SFPs). Moreover, both types should serve to reduce morbidity and mortality, specifi cally by acting on the interaction between malnutrition and infection. However, no SFP can address the primary causes of malnutrition; this can only be achieved through GFDs, or economic, water and habitat, and health rehabilitation -all of which are priority programmes in crises. SFPs are thus essentially palliative in nature, and doomed to failure should the situation deteriorate in the absence of corrective steps. # NUTRITION MANUAL 1. General comments Chapter XIV -Supplementary\n1.4 The objective of supplementary 1.5 Priority in the intervention strategy feeding programmes feeding programmes 1.6 Intervention criteria\nThe only realistic objectives of supplementary feeding programmes in crisis environments are the following. 9 Temporarily containing malnutrition, morbidity and mortality in the early stages of a developing crisis, until more relevant measures can be introduced effi ciently. SFPs should either target cases of moderate malnutrition, with or without age limitations, or else risk the programme's scope expanding beyond control if all children under 5 are included, whatever their nutritional status, and in this case a signifi cant risk of negative side effects exists. 11 9 Addressing moderate malnutrition effectively where humanitarian intervention is belated, while malnutrition prevention measures are taken (GFDs, interventions in the realms of water and habitat, and access to health services). 9 Providing safety nets (similarly to therapeutic feeding) for the most vulnerable, for which previous measures have proven inadequate (even if they have been conclusive for most of the victims of the crisis). 9 Providing a relay for therapeutic feeding when therapeutic feeding centres (TFC) are overstretched, by including children as soon as they are no longer severely malnourished, with a view to completing their treatment. For each of the above objectives, SFPs are clearly targeted."
