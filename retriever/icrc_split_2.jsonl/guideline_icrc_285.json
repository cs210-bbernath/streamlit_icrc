"Thus, studying the principles involved in choosing a site constitutes a good revision of the entire unit. # Selecting a Site\nAs far as possible, populations in crisis should always be assisted in their homes, in order to avoid the major health risk entailed by population movements. 57 Nonetheless, many emergency situations do involve displaced populations, 58 in which case the problem of choosing a reception site may arise. More often than not, however, humanitarian agencies have to deal with a fait accompli. Sometimes the victims themselves have already chosen their new location; more often, the local authorities have imposed a site on them. This de facto situation should not, however, prevent humanitarian agencies from standing back a little to consider whether the arbitrarily selected site meets the minimal requirements necessary to guarantee acceptable living conditions for the people who must live there. # Main Factors to Consider\nThe main factors that should be considered in assessing a site are:\n. access to water & Natural drainage This factor is important for the removal of liquid waste. In displaced-person camps during emergencies, the systems recommended for waste disposal do not require water. But a system for removing liquid waste (the products of domestic use and personal hygiene) must be set up. Methods of treating liquid waste, which involve installing settling tanks, will not be described here. This section will merely enumerate the general principles underlying emergency solutions to the most pressing problems. The main principle is to plan the camp on enough of a slope to permit waste water to drain naturally. This is plain common sense."
