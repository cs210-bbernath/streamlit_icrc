"# Stocks\nAlthough food stocks are discussed here, the following comments apply equally to medical and material stocks. The anticipation of needs, the rigorous monitoring of commodity movements, inventories and stock maintenance are all necessary in order to limit complications and temptation. # Anticipation of needs\nNeeds are anticipated according to weekly or monthly consumption patterns; this type of management allows for buffer stocks according to potential breakdowns in the logistics chain, and implies that orders be placed on time, according to usual delivery delays. While buffer stocks are necessary to allow for possible supply breakdowns, they must nevertheless be kept to a minimum to discourage looting. Storage conditions (heat and humidity) may also preclude the maintenance of large stocks. # Stock-fl ow monitoring\nThe systematic recording of the incoming and outgoing commodity fl ow provides an accurate overview of stock positions at any one moment. # Physical inventories\nInventories are performed at least fortnightly, and involve the physical counting of all commodities that are present in the warehouse. Resulting totals are compared with stock card entries, permitting the application of corrective measures if necessary. # Stock maintenance\nProper stock maintenance consists in rotating commodities on the \"fi rst in/fi rst out\" principle, and according to expiry dates. Warehouses should be cleaned daily. Commodities should be stacked on pallets, and be slightly removed from walls to allow air to circulate. The contents of damaged bags and packaging must be repacked, and contaminated foodstuffs (or those damaged beyond repair) must be disposed of. According to the size of stocks, vermin eradication measures (such as fumigation) may be called for."
