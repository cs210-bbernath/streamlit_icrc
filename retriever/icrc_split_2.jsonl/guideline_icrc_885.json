"United Nations Charter prohibits the use of force between States. The Security Council, however, can ask the member States to take coercive measures (Art. 39), using armed force (Art. 42) or other means (Arts. 40, 41). \n# International Humanitarian Law\nAlong with efforts to promote the political resolution of conflicts, intervention is necessary to minimize the effects of such conflicts. The desire to limit the consequences of war does not imply acceptance of the principle of war; it reflects, rather, a pragmatic approach, based on the realization that in spite of efforts to maintain peace, war exists. International humanitarian law is ''a set of rules aimed at limiting violence and protecting the fundamental rights of the individual in time of armed conflict.'' 4 To do this, international humanitarian law strives to regulate the conduct of hostilities and to guarantee the protection of non-combatants."
