"The fi rst plant is then randomly selected between 1 and 50, say 32; this provides the starting point of the sample: 32 + 50 = 82; 82 + 50 = 132; 132 + 50 = 182, and so on. In the case of the nutritional status of children between 6 and 59 months accommodated in tents in a refugee camp, the average number of children aged 6 to 59 months housed in each tent must be estimated fi rst; multiplying this estimation by the total number of tents provides the overall population number (N). As an indication, if each tent accommodates one mother, then the proportion of children in this age group is approximately 15%."
