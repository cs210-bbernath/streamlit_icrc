"carried out before any humanitarian intervention programs can be planned. On one hand, the victims must understand that intervention will be contemplated only if the problems identified correspond to the mandate of the agency implementing the assessment; on the other, agencies must be able to respond if urgent problems have been observed in the course of the assessment. An ethical problem arises when agencies carry out surveys without having the intention or the means of intervening later should it be necessary. If the problems observed are not urgent, new assessments will be proposed and carried out at regular intervals, to see how the situation develops."
