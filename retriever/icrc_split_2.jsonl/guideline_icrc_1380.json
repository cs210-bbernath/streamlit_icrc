"indicator quality is its validity, which may be expressed mathematically. The validity of an indicator corresponds to its suitability for revealing the object of assessment. Its two components -sensitivity and specifi city -oppose. With respect to a given feature sought within a given population:\n9 indicator sensitivity corresponds to the proportion of cases detected by the indicator as presenting the defi ned feature; 9 indicator specifi city corresponds to the proportion of cases detected by the indicator that do not present the defi ned feature. It is important to understand that indicators are simply a means to approach reality, and thus entail a risk of error."
