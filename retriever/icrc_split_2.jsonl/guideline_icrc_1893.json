"These are the basic principles, but many variations are possible and they are not necessarily harmful, as seen in some stock-breeding communities or among hunters and gatherers. This again underscores the importance of gathering information as to eating habits, their origin, duration, transformations, and deviations from the standard, and the reasons for such change. In crises especially, normal conditions must be determined and be compared with observations at the time of the survey, and the reasons for differences must be understood. The best balance between food groups may be defi ned from the necessary balance between macronutrients. Moreover, food groups can combine in many different ways depending on local habits. The following indications provide a yardstick, with a view to ensuring an adequate intake for the most vulnerable. # Staple foods\nSeveral possibilities exist: the staple food is cereals or tubers (or a combination of the two), or a combination of foodstuffs pertaining to different food groups. It is important for the cases where the staple food is mainly cereals or tubers to be discussed here, as it must in such cases be complemented with an adequate protein supplement. In the case of cereal as discussed in Chapter V, it must be 15 Vegetable oil is preferred to animal fat, which increases the risk of cardiac coronary and cerebral vascular disease. # The themes of nutritional information\n5.3 Diets complemented with at least 60 g of legumes; this amount applies to all age groups and supplies approximately 200 kcal (840 kJ) and 14 g of protein. Considering that the energy complement must supply between 15 and 30% of the overall energy intake in some form, then the cereal content must account for 75 to 60% of the overall energy intake in a 2,400 kcal (10,000 kJ) ration -this amounts to roughly the daily ration of an adult man with light physical activity."
