"is equal to the square root of the complex pq/n. The value of this proportion is unknown and must be estimated, although logical minds have trouble accepting the idea that the value to be calculated must be estimated in advance. If we have no idea of the value of p, we can take as our estimate p = 50%, a figure which gives pq its maximal value (0.25). Since this value is part of the numerator in the following formula, it gives the sample size its maximal value as well, taking into account accuracy and the confidence limits established. ."
