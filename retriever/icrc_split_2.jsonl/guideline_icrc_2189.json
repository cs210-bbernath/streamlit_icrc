"The second is a fi lter, and the third is a purifi er. As indicated above, passive or active sedimentation must be performed before fi ltration according to water turbidity. Purifi cation describes a chemical or thermal treatment that kills germs. Chemical purifi cation with chlorine is the most common method; it must be performed by an expert, and this Manual therefore limits itself to only describing its principle. The different chemicals used for chlorine purifi cation are distinguished according to their specifi c active chlorine concentrations. This concentration must therefore be allowed for in order to achieve a given concentration of chlorine in the water. In contact with water, the chemical dissolves and releases free chlorine. This free chlorine sets on the particles, notably organic particles that contain carbon, through oxidation. Particles that are living organisms (e.g. virus, bacteria) are destroyed by chlorine oxidation. Water purifi cation is completed when all particles have been bound by the chlorine. Free chlorine is thus consumed by purifi cation; consequently, the process may be considered to be completed when free chlorine remains in the water after a given contact period (this period varies according to the amount of water). Residual free chlorine is easily measured: following the required contact period, 0.5 mg of free chlorine per litre of water should remain -this amount is usually effective against possible subsequent contamination. However, the transfer of purifi ed water to unclean containers can deplete residual free chlorine entirely resulting in the preservation of some pathogens. Consequently, 0.5 mg free chlorine water is intended for immediate use -it should not be kept or exposed to sources of contamination. It is worth noting that chlorine has a great affi nity for metals; as a result, water should not be chlorinated or stored in metal containers because chlorine oxidizes metal, and the metal lining of containers can absorb the purifi cation chlorine entirely (much more, in fact, than the amounts of chlorine usually used for water purifi cation). In practice, it may be diffi cult to chlorinate all the water used in a TFC from the onset."
