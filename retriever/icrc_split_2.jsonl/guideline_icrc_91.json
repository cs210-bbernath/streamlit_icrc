"If not, give details (which problems were considered most severe by each group of informants). # Other comments on information in the table:\nNotes Identify the population affected by each of the problems identified in Step 1. Describe each population. For example: \"the people who live near the river\"; \"the residents of village X\"; \"the members of clan Y\"; or \"children in village Z\". Estimate the number of people in each affected population, based on the information collected during the assessment. It is often difficult to estimate numbers, as information from sources differs. I If estimates from different informants are reasonably close, take an average of the estimates. For example, informant A gives an estimate of 500 people, informant B estimates 550 and informant C estimates 575. The number used for the final report is the average of these figures: (500 + 550 + 575)/3 = 540. I If estimates from different sources vary greatly, you will have to judge which source is most reliable."
