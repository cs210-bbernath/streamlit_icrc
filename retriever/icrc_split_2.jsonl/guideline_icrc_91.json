"affected population, based on the information collected during the assessment. It is often difficult to estimate numbers, as information from sources differs. I If estimates from different informants are reasonably close, take an average of the estimates. For example, informant A gives an estimate of 500 people, informant B estimates 550 and informant C estimates 575. The number used for the final report is the average of these figures: (500 + 550 + 575)/3 = 540. I If estimates from different sources vary greatly, you will have to judge which source is most reliable. For example, informant X gives an estimate of 500 people, informant Y estimates 1,500 and informant Z estimates 1,600."
