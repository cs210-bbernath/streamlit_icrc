"# Discharge of benefi ciaries\nThe criteria for discharge have been discussed above. In principle, the benefi ciary's nutritional status should have remained stable, equal to or above discharge thresholds, for a fortnight. However, depending on the severity of the situation, it may be necessary to accelerate the rotation of benefi ciaries and, therefore, reduce or even waive this safety period. Furthermore, it is necessary to expel absentees and cases of bad behaviour (theft, refusal to abide by the rules of the centre, poor conduct), be they on the part of accompanying relatives or the benefi ciary himself."
