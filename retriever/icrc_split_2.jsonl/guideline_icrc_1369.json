"The autonomy of civilian populations (and, thus, their dignity) must be preserved as much as possible, even in war. The observance of other humanitarian law provisions is therefore a prerequisite: this applies to the prohibition of forced movement, of attacks on and looting of objects that are indispensable to the survival of civilians, or of means of warfare (such as the indiscriminate dissemination of landmines) that prevent the cultivation of agricultural land. Humanitarian agencies can on occasion resort to reprimands or reminders based upon their observations."
