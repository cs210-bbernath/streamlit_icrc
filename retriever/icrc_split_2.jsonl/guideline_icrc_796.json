"or a parallel one created specifically for the emergency situation. 42 The implementation of aid programs that are not integrated into some kind of comprehensive system is apt to result in ineffectiveness due to the absence of longterm follow-up and the lack of coherence between the different programs. Increasingly, humanitarian relief must take into account the capacities of the local facilities and their desire to manage crisis situations themselves. The strategy used by humanitarian agencies occasionally goes against this tendency for the sake of short-term effectiveness. Although a certain independence is necessary, especially in conflict situations, it does not preclude integration of the aid within the local health-care system -if one exists."
