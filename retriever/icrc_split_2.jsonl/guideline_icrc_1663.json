"and must not necessarily refl ect a specifi c reality. Realistic planning rations is a contradiction in terms, as are rations that correspond exactly to the needs of target groups. The corollary of these remarks is that agencies must secure the means for adjusting planning rations to reality as closely as possible. This implies the introduction of monitoring systems to follow up general distribution. In this respect (because average adult weight infl uences the average nutritional need), the body mass index (BMI) of an adult population sample may be recorded at the time of distribution in order to determine its nutritional status and the average weight for ration calculation."
