"In practice, the following criteria may be applied in defi ning cause and effect relations. 1. The exposure to the phenomenon must precede the problem (this defi nes the chronological sequence). 2. The risk of facing the problem is signifi cant for those who have been exposed to the phenomenon, and minor or non-existent among those who have not (this defi nes the force of the cause and effect relation). 3. The risk of facing the problem is greater for those who have been exposed to the phenomenon seriously than for those whose exposure was lower (this defi nes the risk according to the degree of exposure). 4. No other factors (independent of the phenomenon) could cause a serious risk of facing the problem (this defi nes the specifi city of the cause and effect relation). 5. The risk of facing the problem disappears with the phenomenon (this also defi nes the force of the cause and effect relation). 6. The cause and effect relation may be demonstrated by different independent types of information (this defi nes the corroboration of results). The above criteria are not easily verifi ed because of the number of variables they involve; strictly, this would demand cohort and case-control studies in order to identify the causes of the problem 2. The different types of assessment 2.1 Preliminary appraisal accurately. In statistics, cohort studies follow subjects that meet certain criteria, and compare them over time with another group that is not affected by that condition; case-control studies on the other hand compare subjects that meet certain criteria (\"cases\") with another group that is not affected (\"controls\"). Both methods contribute to defi ning the force of the cause and effect relation; however, such studies are usually diffi cult to conduct in the circumstances surrounding humanitarian action."
