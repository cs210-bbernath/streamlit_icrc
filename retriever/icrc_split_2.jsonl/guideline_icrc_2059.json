"All oedematous cases should be admitted. It may be useful to measure the mid-upper arm (or brachial) circumference (MUAC) in order to distinguish between individuals that share the same appearance. However, anthropometry should never provide the only basis for the admission of non-oedematous patients, especially if the method used is the weight-for-height index; 5 this index can in fact be quite misleading because it takes the entire organism into account, including subclinical oedema, intestinal parasites, and fl uid retention resulting from infection and infl ammation. As a result, a weight-for-height index of -3 Z-scores in humid and hot conditions, with high levels of intestinal parasites and infectious disease will probably not mean the same degree of wasting as the same index in dry conditions in the absence of parasitoses. As mentioned earlier, substantial differences were noted between the Ethiopian highlands early in the rainy season and the desert fringes in arid conditions at the same moment. With the same weightfor-height index, the MUAC of highland children was much smaller than that of desert children."
