"The WHO and MSF are rather in favour of this option (WHO, 1999;MSF, 1995); experience however shows that the answer should vary according to circumstances. In famines, where severe malnutrition is mainly primary and patients are above all malnourished but seldom sick, systematic treatment should be restricted to kwashiorkor cases; marasmus cases on the other hand should be carefully examined upon admission, and treated if infection is demonstrated by clinical signs and/or the patient's history. In circumstances where primary and secondary malnutrition combine, or where malnutrition is mainly secondary because of climatic variations or poor hygiene (that is, where malnutrition results rather from infection), it is best not to run unnecessary risks and resort instead to systematic treatment."
