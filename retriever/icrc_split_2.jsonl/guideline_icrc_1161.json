"are destroyed), or hypochromic (red blood cells contain little haemoglobin). Folic acid and vitamin B 12 are the major limiting factors because of their contribution to synthesis in the bone marrow, whereas iron is limiting because it is a constituent of haemoglobin. Defi ciency in folic acid and vitamin B 12 induces macrocytic anaemia, whereas iron defi ciency induces microcytic and hypochromic anaemia. Anaemia caused by iron defi ciency in the organism and defi ciency in folic acid and vitamin B 12 is called dimorphic anaemia. It is common among poor populations. This Manual considers the two main causes of anaemia, being iron defi ciency in the organism, and folic acid defi ciency."
