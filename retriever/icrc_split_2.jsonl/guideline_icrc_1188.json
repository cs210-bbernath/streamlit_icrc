"30 to 50 mg of iodine per kilogram (PAHO, 1986). Iodine must be in the form of potassium iodate and not iodide (the latter is highly sensitive to humidity and heat). One gram of potassium iodate contains 0.6 g of iodine; enrichment thus consists of 50 to 83 mg of potassium iodate per kilogram of salt. The enrichment of table salt has become common in the industrialized West, but this is not the case where poverty, war, remoteness, and the absence of political commitment combine to eclipse the issue. Some populations have also been known to reject unfamiliar salt. Where iodized salt is unavailable or unacceptable, the entire population may be injected with iodine-enriched oil, in doses that avert defi ciency for three to fi ve years."
