"of operations. # Humanitarian ethics 3.2 Ethics concerning victims 1. At the stage of initial assessments, crisis victims are usually in the best position to identify their problems and address them. However, their requirements may not match the agency's means or its objectives. They must therefore be informed of the type of information that is sought, and be involved in the defi nition of the problems, needs for assistance, and operational priorities and objectives, while being made aware of limitations and possibilities. Victims frequently equate assessment with the promise of assistance. Assessment should therefore be based upon the fi rm intention to act upon observed needs, to secure the means to do so, or to ensure that another agency will respond."
