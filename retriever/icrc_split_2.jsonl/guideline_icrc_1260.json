"This permits discussion with large groups, and the exchange of views then proceeds in waves, from one sub-group to another. Provided that the discussion is well organized and that participants are well aware of the purpose and can express their concerns, this method usually yields excellent results. The decision-making process is shared by all involved, the risk of erring is reduced, and humanitarian \"imperialism\" is less likely to take over. Moreover, if the group has understood the issues and has made its own decisions, implementation is facilitated and is less likely to encounter problems or unexpected opposition; it also minimizes secondary and, above all, negative effects. # NUTRITION MANUAL\nChapter X -Assessment and planning I."
