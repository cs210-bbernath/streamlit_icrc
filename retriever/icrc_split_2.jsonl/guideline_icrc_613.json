"16. 10 The results of such a test can be accepted as fairly conclusive, although the fact that no parasites are detected in a microscopic examination does not formally rule out malarial infection. # Principle of Test Sensitivity and Specificity\nTest Healthy subjects Sick subjects Results:\nThe capacity of the test to distinguish sick subjects (sensitivity) and healthy subjects (specificity)  \n\n# PPV = true + (true +) + (false +)\n\n# PPV\n\n# Sick Yes No\nIn an emergency situation, the tendency is to try to treat as many subjects as possible by reducing the number of true positive cases tagged as negative by the test. This orientation gives sensitivity priority over specificity."
