"However, when the situation deteriorates, this approach is adequate only if the available means permit the opening of as many centres as required. # Warning\nWhen the purpose of an SFP is to contain malnutrition, morbidity and mortality temporarily until an adequate GFD is set up, a pitfall to be avoided at all costs would be to condition benefi ciary admission on the distribution of a food ration to the rest of their family. It would appear that all needy families would thus be targeted; however, in practically all cases, this results in a large number of families depriving one of their children in order to gain access to the distribution. Beyond the harm done to the children, the agency running the SFP sometimes runs out of food resources (both for the SFP and for the family rations). This can lead to disaster if the GFD is delayed."
