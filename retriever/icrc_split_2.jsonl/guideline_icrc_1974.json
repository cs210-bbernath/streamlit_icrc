"The reference documents are the same as for the Anthropometry Kit, in addition to the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) Clinical Guide (French and English). The above Therapeutic Feeding Kit is designed for 100 children. Should the centre accommodate more children, it is better to complete it with 1 or 2 Supplementary Feeding Kits (Annex 18), designed for 250 children, than to add 3 or 6 Therapeutic Feeding Kits. Beyond these dimensions, it is best to set up a second centre."
