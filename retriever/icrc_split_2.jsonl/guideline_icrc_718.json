"If not, their files must be consulted. Depending on the reliability and specificity of the tests conducted (clinical examination, bacteriological tests), the patients admitted may or may not prove to have been infected with meningococcal meningitis, measles, typhoid fever, cholera, or whatever disease was suspected. When initial reports are based on rumors, in contrast, it is much more difficult to ascertain the truth of the matter. The source of the rumors must be sought so that the original cases can be found. The patients may be:\n. cured -in which case the patient history may help establish a diagnosis;\n. still sick -a clinical examination and, if necessary, biological tests 69 will make diagnosis possible;\n. dead or absent -the sole possibility in this case is to question the patient's family or friends. If doubts persist, new cases must be sought. If there is no longer any doubt, a case profile will have been defined which will serve as a basis for identifying subsequent cases. 70\n69 There are lists of available equipment for taking specimens under satisfactory conditions.
