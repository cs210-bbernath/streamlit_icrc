"# National Economic Vulnerability\nInconsistent economic development policies, corruption, and city officials' lack of interest in rural areas are a few of the factors that help increase the vulnerability of populations at the end of the economic chain. Economic underdevelopment means that the installation of infrastructure essential to the economy cannot be financed. This plays a major role in disasters, in which the road network, means of communication (telephone), etc., are so important. # International Economic Vulnerability\nEconomic vulnerability follows the Dow Jones index. An international economic recession does not have much effect on the volume of international aid sent to countries in the grip of disaster. However, if there is no acute emergency, programs to prepare for or prevent disasters (dams for flood control, for example) are cut to the bone."
