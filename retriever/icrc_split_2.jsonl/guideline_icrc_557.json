"# Communication between Levels\nSetting up a communication system between the dispensaries and the hospital is usually not a problem (radio, ambulances). Maintaining regular communication between the primary level (CHWs) and the secondary level (dispensaries), however, is much more difficult, owing to the lack of personnel to supervise the CHWs and the absence of information on cases referred to the dispensary."
