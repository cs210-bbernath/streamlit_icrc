It is now generally accepted that it provides a degree of protection, particularly in young children, against serious forms of the disease such as miliary TB and TB meningitis.'' 20\nThe limits of the target group for immunization against measles should be reviewed in light of many recently published studies on the rate of measles incidence in children under nine months of age."
