"It may be called for to complement other programmes, or vice-versa. # THE OBJECTIVES OF GFD\nIn the framework of humanitarian action, the objective of GFD is usually understood as mitigating hunger. Hunger in this sense refers to classic situations of famine, which deprive groups of their access to food because of extreme destitution and/or insuffi cient food availability (whatever the group's resources to secure it); the expression also applies to situations in which displaced persons or refugees depend exclusively on external assistance. In such cases, GFD amounts to survival relief, and aims at:\nensuring adequate food access, through the provision of food where the primary role of that food is to provide nutrients. Such action is expected to preserve or improve the nutritional status, that is, to protect or restore the functional capacity of household members. This implies that food rations be adapted to circumstances, and distributed regularly according to plan. In earlier stages of the famine process, during recovery from it, and in the case of groups that have remained in their usual environment, GFD also serves to compensate an insuffi cient economic performance that affects access to food. In such cases, GFD compensates food scarcity where that exists, and also frees time and resources that would otherwise be used to feed the household to the detriment of other basic activities and economic sustainability. In such cases, GFD also amounts to economic support, and the respective importance of the nutritional and economic contributions must be weighed carefully according to the needs in both categories. In such circumstances, (in addition to ensuring adequate food access), GFD also aims at:\npreserving the activities and resources required for the survival of the household. To this end, it may pursue the following specifi c objectives:\n1."
