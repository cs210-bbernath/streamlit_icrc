"by applying thresholds that permit the defi nition of malnutrition. \n# Interpreting indicators\nThe use of indicators assumes that they have meaning. To be valid, the variability of the indicator must be related mainly to the variability of what the indicator is intended to refl ect; the two must also be connected directly and quantitatively. For example, purchasing power may be taken as an indicator of access to food: in this case, access to food must vary like purchasing power, indicating that the latter is the main means of access to food, independently of the circumstances. If, on the other hand, access to food is also infl uenced by gathering activities and home production for selfconsumption, then purchasing power on its own is not a good indicator of access to food."
