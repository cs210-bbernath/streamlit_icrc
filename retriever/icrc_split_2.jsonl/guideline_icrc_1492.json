"indication as to whether he is severely or moderately so. \n# Standard deviation from the median\nStandard deviation 26 is also called Z-score. Its use is spreading, because it is the best index to compare populations (and, thus, surveys) and individuals. Variables that are characteristic of a reference population usually follow a normal distribution of 2 standard deviations around the median, and this includes approximately 95% of the reference population. In biology and medical science, values lying outside this bracket are considered as abnormal or pathological. The expression of the index in standard deviations or Z-scores is as follows:\n-bserved value -median - ---------------------= weight-for-height index in standard deviations or Z-scores standard deviation\nIn the above example the standard deviation below the median is 1 kg, therefore:\n(8-11) / 1 = -3 standard deviations or -3 Z-scores\nAll the above calculations require the use of reference tables indicating the median, standard deviations, and centiles or anthropometric data processing computer programmes."
