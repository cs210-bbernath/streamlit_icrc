"Victims of a crisis do not all suffer identically because their vulnerabilities differ. In other words, the need for assistance is not equally signifi cant and urgent for all, and those that face the greatest risk must be identifi ed accordingly. To this end, hypotheses are formulated as to the relative vulnerability of different groups with respect to a given phenomenon (e.g. drought); population categories are then ranked by order of decreasing vulnerability (e.g. in relation to their distance from the droughtaffected area, or on the basis of functional classifi cation). The features that appear to be most important in mitigating vulnerability (e.g."
