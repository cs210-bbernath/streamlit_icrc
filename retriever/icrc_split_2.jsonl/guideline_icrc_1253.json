"It should be obvious for humanitarian action to respect deontology. However, it faces many constraints and pressures: political agendas are sometimes incompatible with humanitarian concerns, good intentions still often lead to amateurism, 15 and emergency provides the pretext for hasty action. To be ethical, action must:\n9 pursue prevention and effi ciency, according to the strategy defi ned above; 16 9 arise from adequate assessment in order to act effectively; 9 follow a clear procedure; 9 comply with recognized operational policies and professional practices; 9 involve the necessary resources in terms of funding, material, personnel, skills, and management -ethical action cannot condone miserliness or amateurism, and humanitarian aid must be strictly tailored to the needs; 9 rest upon a strong commitment for the entire duration of the operation, and not risk, for example, untimely changes in outlook owing to fi nancial or political considerations and priorities (programmes may lose their fashionable appeal well before the needs recede); 9 avoid negative side effects, or at least restrict them to a minimum."
