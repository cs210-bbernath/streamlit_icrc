"This demands some understanding of the different data collection methods, and the different possible indicators. Depending on the ultimate purpose, the answer may well be to refrain from both comprehensive assessment and sampling. In case of doubt, experts or colleagues faced with similar circumstances must be consulted. The answer is not necessarily reassuring, but dialogue allows for considering the problem from different angles, and facilitates the defi nition of the required course of action, if only by accepting the uncertainty risk related to constraints. Once the purpose of sampling is clearly established, the following general recommendations facilitate the choice of sampling method. 9 Simple random sampling is ideal in its orthodox form. This involves the complete and updated census of subjects, and unrestricted access to the entire population, because all subjects must have equal probability of being selected. Census itself may be performed independently, but is time-consuming. The region under consideration may be restricted deliberately to accessible areas; and data for inaccessible areas must then be obtained indirectly. Time can represent a major constraint if the subjects are scattered and diffi cult to locate. 9 Systematic random sampling is recommended in regions where subjects are geographically distributed (this facilitates their location). 9 Cluster random sampling is recommended for large, scattered populations that may not be homogenous, without it being possible or necessary to defi ne more homogenous sub-groups. # Sample size\nThe underlying principle here is that, whatever the issue under investigation, the size of the population from which the sample is taken is infi nite. As a result, the size of the sample is not determined by the size of the population. Exceptions exist, in the case of small groups whose size is well known; in such cases, the sample size may be recalculated (see below). The paradox lies in the 3. General aspects of assessment methods 3.4 Selecting subjects fact that the total population must be known in order to draw the sample, or to defi ne the interval size. The most important concept, however, is that sample size is determined primarily by whether the variable under consideration is qualitative or quantitative. # Quantitative variables\nBecause of their nature, biological dimensions (such as anthropometric variables, seric rates, and birth weight) usually follow a distribution that corresponds closely to normal law. 17 This translates into the fact that even with a limited number of sample values (\"n\"), the average (\"m\") of these \"n\" values is rather reliable. Reliability is considered to be adequate as of 30 values; hence, in the case of biological quantitative variables, the sample size is suffi cient if it reaches 30 values; any number above is considered to be a large sample. The result of quantitative variable sampling is expressed by an average \"m\", and its standard deviation \"s\" (m \u00b1 s). A calculator or computer spreadsheet can provide the average and standard deviation. 18\n\n# Qualitative variables\nFor qualitative variables, sample size is primarily determined by the sampling method. It is then infl uenced by the sampling error that is considered as acceptable, the determined confi dence interval, the expected prevalence rate (the actual prevalence rate is what is sought), and the total population when it is small. The result of qualitative variable sampling is expressed in prevalence rates \"p\" subject to the obtained degree of accuracy, which amounts to more or less a given percentage \"b\" around \"p\": p \u00b1 b%. # Simple random sampling\nAny value obtained experimentally by sampling is of course liable to differ from the real value, as obtained by comprehensive investigation. It is best, therefore, to defi ne the acceptable risk that experimental values are really different from real values, and an acceptable confi dence interval within which the real value is likely to be found, according to the sampling error -without it being possible to know where exactly in that interval it is located. Usually, the sampling error is set at 5%; in other words, it is accepted that there are 5 chances out of 100 that the real value is not included in the confi dence interval at all. The confi dence interval itself is determined by the intended accuracy: a 5% accuracy around the experimental result is usually considered as acceptable, but this depends on circumstances. For example, in comparing results with those obtained six months before, confi dence intervals must not overlap, and this may require smaller confi dence intervals. Moreover, a 5% confi dence interval around a 50% prevalence rate is perfectly acceptable, but would be meaningless for a 3% prevalence rate. The expected prevalence rate raises one of the two diffi culties of understanding of the sampling process (the second being that population size does not infl uence sample size, except for small populations). It seems odd to use a sampling method to determine the prevalence rate of a given variable, when that rate is required as a preliminary for calculating sample size. This involves a preliminary estimation of results, which is infl uenced by the knowledge of the fi eld and of existing problems, or the results of pilot studies. When a prevalence rate cannot be estimated with suffi cient accuracy, it is arbitrarily set at 50% -this rate gives the largest sample (for equal sampling error and confi dence intervals) according to the formula below. This avoids unpleasant surprises in the calculation, because the further the real rate is located from 50% (plus or minus), the greater accuracy will be achieved for a given sample. # NUTRITION MANUAL\nChapter X -Assessment and planning 3."
