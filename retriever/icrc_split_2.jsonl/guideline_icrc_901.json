"the ''hard core'' of human rights cannot be put aside. These are the intangible rights -for example, the right to life, the right not to be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment, and the right not to be enslaved. \n# Precision of Legal Rules\nA contradiction may be seen between the impossibility of derogating from the rules of international humanitarian law and the obligation to make allowance for ''military necessity.''
