"they are required, rather than wasting time collecting useless information. \n# DATA COLLECTION\n\n# Targeting preliminary appraisal\nData collection is always targeted. The key to the target is provided by the aggressive phenomena, recognized vulnerabilities and, in the case of preliminary or intermediary assessment, existing harm that corresponds to the warning signals. Preliminary appraisal must defi ne assessment areas and groups that may share the same needs because they face the same problems. Targeting regions and population groups for assessment is derived fi rstly from the warning signals, and later broadens in order to include all regions and groups that face the same risk, or will do so."
