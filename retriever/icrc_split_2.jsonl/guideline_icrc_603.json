"the same that would be used in a normal situation. For example, the anthropometric measurements of weight for height and weight for age are used to detect conditions of severe malnutrition. Weight-for-height, however, is used to measure acute severe malnutrition, while weight-for-age can indicate both acute and chronic severe malnutrition. For this reason, the results obtained with the weight-for-age method are not representative of a problem of severe acute malnutrition which arises abruptly during a disaster. \n\n# Choice of Variables for Interpreting Indicator Variations\n\n# Validity\nThe validity of a test is characterized by two properties, sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is defined as ''the proportion of true positives correctly identified by a test,'' while specificity is defined as ''the proportion of true negatives correctly identified by a test.'' 9 The positive predictive value (PPV) of a test expresses the probability that an individual declared positive by the test actually has the disease."
