"injuries caused by anti-personnel mines illustrates this level of intervention. In many conflicts, notably in Afghanistan and Cambodia, the danger caused by mines persists long after the hostilities end, and it is civilians who continue to suffer the consequences. ''Those who look after people injured by anti-personnel mines and who, day after day, witness the suffering caused by these pernicious weapons, those who produce artificial limbs to help maimed children as they try to cope with their disability, all ask themselves what can be done to put an end to this terrible scourge.'' 5 The role of medical personnel is above all to care for these wounded; but they also have a moral obligation to ask how such injuries can be prevented."
