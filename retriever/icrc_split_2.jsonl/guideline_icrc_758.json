"provision of essential drugs. 13 PHC and EMHIs have similar purposes: to offer populations a health status that conforms to norms reflecting local conditions. EMHIs are not directly related to satisfactory social and economic development. In fact, EMHIs are usually artificially based: financial, logistic, technical, and managerial supports 14 are usually external, particularly when the implementation of the programs has no connection whatsoever with the local authorities. The danger with EMHIs is that they are apt to leave nothing behind when they and the outside aid come to an end. In this sense, PHC and EMHIs are different. The two approaches use a similar strategy, however. Access to health services must be as broad and as easy as possible, and the emphasis is on preventive measures. One difference, however, is that in emergency situations, results are expected within a couple of weeks, while results from PHC are part of the strategy of ''health for all by the year 2000.''\nA second difference lies in the population's preliminary involvement in selecting the intervention programs. Taking the ''wants/needs'' formulated by the population into account is imperative in the framework of PHC, whereas in emergency situations, health measures are usually imposed by humanitarian agencies. On occasion, however, a synthesis of the two different approaches may be possible."
