"The same calculation applied to a man initially weighing 50 kg leads roughly to the same result, in which protein is slightly limiting. If catch-up is less ambitious and is limited to 2 g/kg/day, then protein is no longer limiting. In other words, protein may limit the nutritional catch-up rate in adults; in small children, however, the nutritional catch-up rate is usually only limited by energy because their protein maintenance requirements are lower with respect to energy 3. GFD implementation 3.2 Setting rations than those of adults. The protein requirements of a 3-year-old child are 1.15 g for 100 kcal (4.8% P/E%); those of an adult man are 1.7g/100 kcal (6.8% P/E%). Nutritional catch-up implies higher P/E% ratios than maintenance, and the P/E% ratio must therefore be approximately 10% in order to enable a 3-year-old to catch up 20 g/kg/day; this is covered by basic foods. In the case of an adult weighing 45 kg, it is in the order of 15%, which cannot be covered by standard basic foods. These remarks on catch-up requirements show that it is necessary to clarify the objective of increasing full food rations in order to contribute to nutritional catch-up. Micro-nutrients must also be supplied according to the desired catch-up. 21 Micro-nutrients must clearly permit the catch-up of specifi c defi ciencies and weight, and this involves signifi cantly greater amounts than those allowed for in recommended intakes. Type II micro-nutrients must be supplied in the stoechiometric amounts defi ned in the following Chapter. It is pointless to increase only the protein and energy content of rations if adequate catch-up is sought. Experience in nutritional centres before and after the introduction of the Briend & Golden Protocols (Briend & Golden, 1993) on micro-nutrients shows a catch-up jump from 2-3 g/kg/day to 15-20 g/kg/day for equal amounts of protein and energy, in identical conditions. 22\nPost-distribution losses GFD benefi ciaries can suffer commodity losses, for example in the course of cereal milling (if it is distributed in grains), and despoiling."
