Prime time media coverage facilitates the securing of the funds that are required to exist, and the \"scramble for humanity\" is harsh. Relationships between agencies grow more complex, especially in emergencies, when all rush to the site and confusion grows as to who is doing what, and how. The situation can then evolve towards two extremes, with several possible combinations. In the fi rst extreme, the following aspects predominate:\n9 competition over a territorial occupation at all costs; this leads to anarchy, a waste of resources, and a bad working spirit; 9 competition to be fi rst on the spot, not bothering whether the resulting action is appropriately targeted, useful or even safe for the victims; 9 confrontation as to strategies, depending on the specifi c agendas of the different agencies and their attitude towards host authorities; this leads to confusion and the weakening of the agencies themselves when it is in the interest of the host authorities to divide and conquer; 9 inter-agency confl ict, which can arise from confusions as to mandate, but also from competition for the prime position in terms of power, visibility, and operational magnitude; 9 coercion when the major agencies that hold the resources involve implementing partners, and impose upon them whom to assist and how, as defi ned by political motivations rather than humanitarian ethics."
