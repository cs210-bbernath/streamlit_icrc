"standard deviations, and centiles or anthropometric data processing computer programmes. \n# Anthropometry in children\nWeight-for-age or Gomez index Advantages: a good basic indicator that combines ponderal and statural growth and is useful in the monitoring of programme performance; sensitive to slight variations (although many variables can account for weight changes). Drawbacks: does not distinguish wasting from growth retardation (stunting), because a tall, lean child may refl ect the same weight-for-age ratio as a short, stout child; it requires accuracy in setting age, which is usually diffi cult to ensure; weight is infl uenced by variables that may alter the interpretation of results; weight is not always easily measured."
