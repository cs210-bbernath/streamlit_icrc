"object under scrutiny. They are measured and collected as data. For example, atmospheric pollution levels affect morbidity rates; different pollution levels can be chosen (the independent variable) in order to examine their effect on morbidity rates (the dependent variable). \n# Variables\nSimilarly, the appraisal of corpulence resorts to weight-for-height. In this example, weight is the dependent variable (it is determined directly by food intake and health status); it is compared to height, which is independent of corpulence. On the other hand, the height-for-age index is used to appraise statural growth, and height becomes the dependent variable (it is determined by food intake and health status), whereas age is the independent variable in this case."
