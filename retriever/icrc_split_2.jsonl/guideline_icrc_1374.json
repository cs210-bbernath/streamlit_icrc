"GFD is understood in contrast to supplementary feeding, which targets individuals with specifi c conditions rather than households, as discussed in Chapter XIV. The specifi c conditions that justify supplementary feeding relate to physiological vulnerability (for example, the malnourished, pre-school children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, the elderly and the sick) or environmental vulnerability (that is, associated with living conditions -for example in hospitals, orphanages, asylums, homes for the elderly, and prisons). Obviously, this does not preclude GFD in such circumstances."
