"It may be necessary to target groups that are especially vulnerable or, where this is not possible, to set ration levels that satisfy the need for assistance as effectively as possible. This however implies that some will receive too much, and others too little; the latter may require additional safety measures such as the establishment of supplementary and therapeutic feeding centres in order to treat moderate and severe malnutrition. 9 Coping mechanisms and the economic potential of available resources can be diffi cult to appraise, and may be unclear if target groups are still at the stage of exploring available opportunities. 9 Over time, GFD benefi ciaries usually improve their economic effi ciency and their nutritional status, and this may justify ration adjustments. However, fi eld workers must not follow impressions blindly, and they must remember that GFD rations sometimes provide a nutritional and an economic contribution simultaneously. Food access possibilities alone must therefore not infl uence ration adjustments; the economic situation of ration recipients must be appraised in the light of overall operational objectives. 26\nIn conclusion, the views and behaviour of target groups are once again crucial elements of the decision-making process. Clearly, the more complex the problems and the more volatile the situation, the closer and more frequently fi eld workers must monitor access to food and the local economy. In practical terms, the rations provided in Tables 12.5 and 12.6 may be used fully or in part to set complementary rations. To this end, foodstuffs that make up the rations are selected, and then adjusted according to the sub-multiples and distribution frequency in order to reach required amounts. # GFD implementation\n3.2 Setting rations\n\n# Setting rations that also serve as economic exchange commodities\nThe problem\nIt must be clear from the outset that food aid should not serve as a currency. This is a waste of resources and effort, not to mention that its relative value is then usually lower than if cash were distributed instead. This is especially true when many recipients sell the same commodity in order to purchase scarce goods. Humanitarian aid must strive to meet all needs for aid involving economic goods and services necessary for survival, in order to prevent the use of food to other ends than nutritional, or its exchange for essential foodstuffs that are not supplied through GFD. That being said, it is well-known that people utilize donated resources in their own best interest, which reaches far beyond immediate survival. Therefore, part of distributed rations is inevitably exchanged; what matters here is to limit this phenomenon as much as possible. In this respect, the close monitoring of the utilization of resources and in-depth dialogue with their recipients should permit the adjustment of assistance in order to optimize its impact. When humanitarian assistance does not satisfy (deliberately or owing to negligence) all the needs for aid in terms of survival, food will inevitably serve as an exchange commodity. Such developments are not surprising: the victims cannot be blamed for such behaviour and it is too late to do anything but deplore the resulting malnutrition. In such circumstances, rations that have been set in order to satisfy physiological needs cannot do so -the defi cit being determined by what had to be exchanged -and malnutrition will be proportional to the destitution of the victims. This leads to the fundamental paradox in which the more destitute and hungry people are, the more food aid they need to devote to non-nutritional purposes if food is their only resource. As a result, the utilization of food as an exchange commodity should only be planned as a last resort, when no alternative exists, or when this is the only way of opening access to essential goods and services. In any case, such a decision must rest on thorough assessment. # Practical aspects\nThe distribution of food rations is seldom intended to supply an exchange commodity only; in principle it usually aims at two objectives, whose relative importances vary according to circumstances. 1."
