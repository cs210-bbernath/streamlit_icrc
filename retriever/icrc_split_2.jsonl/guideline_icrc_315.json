"proportionately increases the number of people sensitive to infectious agents. \n# Individual Immunity\nIn developing countries, most people over the age of three or four are immune to measles, either because they have been vaccinated or because they have already had the disease. The group of individuals actually at risk, therefore, is restricted to children under the age of four or five. Similarly, in developing countries, most individuals over the age of five can be assumed to have been exposed to the tubercle bacillus, though it is impossible to say what percentage of them will actually develop tuberculosis. Another factor is malnutrition: malnourished children are particularly susceptible to infections."
