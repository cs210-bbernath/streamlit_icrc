"Depending on the data sought, such interviews may prove adequate to indicate which measures need to be taken. For example, a relatively simple questionnaire permits a rapid assessment of the main causes of death among the children of a displaced population. The procedure to follow can be summarized as follows:\n-Draw up a list of syndromes which appear to be the main causes of death. In the case of communicable diseases, these would consist primarily of measles, diarrheal diseases, malaria, and meningitis. -Describe the symptoms used to identify the communicable diseases in question; the medical personnel and the individuals questioned may have markedly different interpretations of the same clinical manifestation."
