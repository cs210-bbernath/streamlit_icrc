"In this example, it is best to select one sample of displaced persons, and another of residents, for comparison. Likewise, drought in southern Sudan probably does not affect pastoralists, farmers and fi shermen in the same way. Any variable associated with the impact of drought on these three groups and investigated through sampling would imply a separate sample for each group. 15 Following the same logic, in measuring the nutritional status of a given group, if specifi c age groups or sex constitute a vulnerability or discrimination factor, then sampling must be performed in each age group and for each sex. To ensure that group homogeneity is observed, sampling must always be based upon the study of documents or pilot study in the fi eld that detects groups that may differ from one another with respect to the variable under scrutiny. Pilot studies can also serve to estimate the prevalence rate of a given variable, if the latter is to be measured later by sampling. In case of doubt as to homogeneity, different sampling methods may be used. # Probability sampling\nAll individuals in the group must have equal probabilities of being selected for inclusion in the sample. This requires the use of random selection and a fair understanding of the group (or population) under scrutiny. Selection methods are determined by the sampling method, which is infl uenced by the accuracy of sampling, and by constraints of time, resources, and access. # Accuracy\nThe accuracy of the result is determined by the size of the sample, which is set mainly by the sampling method. # Simple random sampling\nThis is statistically the most orthodox method in terms of random selection. Theoretically, this method requires the availability of lists (e.g. census data) of all numbered subjects (individuals or objects) of the population under consideration, and implies that they are all accessible. The number of subjects amounting to the size of the sample is then randomly chosen. This may be done by resorting to tables (an example is provided in Annex 19), mixing tickets up in a hat, rolling dice, or NUTRITION MANUAL Chapter X -Assessment and planning 3. General aspects I. Assessment of assessment methods 3.4 Selecting subjects mechanical sampling performed by a calculator (or computer spreadsheets) that generates random numbers. 16 Selected numbers are then all subjected to the survey itself. It is often impossible to conduct a comprehensive census, or to have access to the entire population, and the process can be quite costly and time-consuming. Systematic and cluster sampling methods reduce this type of constraint substantially. Another (less rigorous) random sampling method produces accurate results, provided that the enquiry area is homogenous with respect to the variable under scrutiny. The observer places an empty bottle (or a pencil on a book) as close as possible to the centre of the area under consideration, spins it, and systematically selects all subjects in the direction indicated by the bottleneck, and as far as the area extends in that direction. If the number of subjects is insuffi cient, the exercise may be repeated as often as necessary."
