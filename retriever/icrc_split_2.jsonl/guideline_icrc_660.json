"the 2 x 2 table option of EPIINFO's STATCALC function. The Chi-Squared (X 2 ) Test\nThe chi-squared test is used for values expressing the number of individuals from two or more populations who possess or do not possess the characteristic sought. The purpose of the test is to show whether or not any difference found between the values from samples of the different population groups is significant. The chi-squared test consists in computing the differences between the values observed and the one to be expected if there were no difference between the values. 39 To estimate these values, we must calculate the total number of subjects presenting the characteristic as a percentage of the entire population, and apply this percentage to the observed values of the number of cases."
