"grain travels better, is easier to store and keeps longer. Its handling entails fewer losses, and grain is more easily assembled and repacked if its bags are damaged; it is also cheaper than fl our. It is commonly argued, moreover, that cereal grain is more nutritious than fl our; this justifi cation is however specious here because the grain will need to be milled prior to its consumption, and local milling can involve greater losses than if it is carried out in the producing country. The advantage of milled cereal lies in the fact that it is ready for consumption, does not entail milling losses or costs and, above all, it may be enriched in micro-nutrients (which can limit defi ciency disorders substantially)."
