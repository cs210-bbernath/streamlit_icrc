"it is difficult, if not impossible, to control population movements. \n# Tuberculosis\n\n# Impact of the Problem\nTuberculosis is not a disease involving an epidemic risk that necessitates immediate action. Nonetheless, it is a serious problem which must be dealt with, even during an emergency. Where people are concentrated in large groups, priority is given to seeking out those tubercular subjects presenting positive sputum. Sputum containing tubercle bacilli (''Koch's bacillus'') not only indicates the presence of a serious form of the disease, 89 but is in itself a certain means of transmitting the disease to groups at risk. 90 During an emergency situation, this pragmatic approach confines the problem, at least initially, to determining the number of cases presenting positive sputum."
