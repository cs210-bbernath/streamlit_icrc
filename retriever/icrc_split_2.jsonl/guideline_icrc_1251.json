"This amounts to considering each stratum as a specifi c target for investigation. This method is illustrated in Figure 10.10 below. .10 illustrates three \"orthodox\" stratifi cation methods and one (by region) that is not. Stratifi cation, which consists of identifying specifi c strata within a homogenous population, is easily confused with assessment targeting, which involves the identifi cation of specifi c regions or populations that are more or less affected by a variable pertaining to the feeding process. Stratifi cation, in fact, amounts to refi ned assessment targeting. Depending on the ultimate purpose of the exercise, sampling methods may be combined and adapted according to situations -this approach is called \"multi-stage sampling\". This method is usually most relevant to fi eld work, as it allows for complex situations or populations."
