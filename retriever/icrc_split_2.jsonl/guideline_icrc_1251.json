"professionalism of fi eld staff and the respect of procedures. \n# Professionalism\nThe professionalism expected of humanitarian staff comprises training and experience in the fi rst place. In addition, considerable tact and sensitivity are essential for these two aspects to be fully exploited in the fi eld. Sensitivity is a quality that combines courtesy and respect for local customs. In humanitarian operations, the concept reaches further: it is an instrument fundamental to establishing dialogue and securing acceptance, understanding problems and, ultimately, deserving respect. When locally available skills are inadequate, staff must be trained and coached in the fi eld, and this provides the advantage of real-life conditions."
