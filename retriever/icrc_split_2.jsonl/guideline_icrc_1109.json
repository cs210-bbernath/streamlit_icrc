Nutritional disorder 2.5 Specifi c defi ciency orally during two weeks usually suffi ces to remedy wet, infantile and shoshin beriberi, and to arrest the neuropathy associated with dry beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. In some cases, the consumption of legumes up to 120 g per day prevents and treats beriberi (Davidson et al., 1979). This comment does not imply that this treatment should be applied alone in the presence of alternatives, but rather that the absence of chemical thiamine should not discourage action."
