"death, but this is not always borne out by reality. \n# Dermatosis\nThe fi rst clinical sign of pellagra is dermatosis. It is photosensitive, and appears symmetrically on skin that is exposed to the sun. It is particularly visible around the collar (known as Casal collar), the shoulder blades, the forearms and wrists, the back of the hands and the shinbones. On white skin, it appears as strong sunburn; darker skin initially shows stronger pigmentation, and then dries and cracks. The affected area is rough. Dermatosis evolves towards desquamation, crevices and vesicular lesions. Lesions that are directly exposed to the sun cause a painful burning sensation (Latham, 1979)."
