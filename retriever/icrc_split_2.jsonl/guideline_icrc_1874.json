"In case of problems, the child must be referred to a healthcare facility immediately. # Mother-to-child HIV infection\nIn the last thirty years, the promotion of breastfeeding has been viewed as a priority in limiting infant morbidity and mortality. Signifi cant progress has resulted, both in terms of breastfeeding trends and of commercial and humanitarian practice. Today however, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is a serious 5. The themes of nutritional information 5.2 Feeding infants and small children threat to past efforts and achievements because HIV infection (especially HIV-1) can be transmitted by the mother to her child through her milk. The overall risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission is 15 to 25% in the case of mothers who do not breastfeed, and 25 to 45% in mothers who do. In populations where breastfeeding prevails, approximately one-third of all infant HIV infection results from breastfeeding. Many aspects of HIV transmission through breastfeeding still require investigation, especially of the actual mechanisms of transmission. The risk of transmission is greater if the mother has only recently been infected or if she is vitamin A defi cient, and it increases with the duration of breastfeeding. This information collected by the WHO (WHO, 1998) highlights the following quandary:\n\"When children born to women living with HIV can be ensured uninterrupted access to nutritionally adequate breast-milk substitutes that are safely prepared and fed to them, they are at less risk of illness and death if they are not breastfed. However, when these conditions are not fulfi lled, in particular in an environment where infectious diseases and malnutrition are the primary causes of death during infancy, artifi cial feeding substantially increases children's risk of illness and death.\" (WHO, 1998). Furthermore, it remains unclear to what extent breastfeeding infl uences HIV development in mothers. The observation that the combination of a good nutritional status and appropriate healthcare substantially limit the progress of the illness is, in a sense, alarming (McAskill, 2000). It indicates that breastfeeding and the resulting drainage of maternal nutritional resources in favour of the child could increase the mother's vulnerability -this would tend to argue in favour of substituting maternal milk with artifi cial alternatives if feasible. This poses a serious problem for humanitarian action, which often deals with groups that face increased health problems in all fi elds, and cannot be treated individually (unless they are gathered in camps). Ultimately, the theoretical answer to mother-to-child HIV transmission through breastfeeding is to supply HIV-positive mothers with appropriate maternal milk substitutes, and the means to prepare them in line with the hygiene standards discussed earlier. The remaining question is then one of feasibility, which is determined by the possibility of:\n9 detecting AIDS cases among pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, without stigmatizing them; 9 obtaining appropriate maternal milk substitutes; 9 ensuring the safe preparation and administration of such substitutes in a durable way; 9 ensuring that other agencies shall indeed follow the cases of these mothers and their children after the completion of the humanitarian operation proper. The diffi culty is recent and many questions remain."
