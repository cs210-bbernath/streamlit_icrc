"Some organizations have a very specific mandate for a particular type of action, such as feeding and nutrition, aid to the handicapped, etc., or for a particular category of victim, such as women and children (UNICEF), war victims (ICRC), or refugees (UNHCR). An initial assessment should not be considered as a collection of information gleaned at random in the field. On the other hand, although the assessment should reflect a systematic quest for data following a pre-established plan, that plan should not become an excuse for neglecting opportunities that may arise in the course of the assessment. Spontaneously acquired information of this kind may help to define problems and identify possibilities for immediate action. # Victims\nThe initial assessment in an emergency situation should aim at clarifying as quickly as possible those major health problems that pose a vital risk to the population affected. The choice of indicators depends on the level of analysis desired. If the goal is to define a serious crisis affecting the population, studies should be restricted to the main indicators capable of demonstrating the existence of a major crisis: mortality rate, malnutrition rate, prevalence of communicable diseases, access to medical care, access to food resources. If the goal is to determine the underlying causes of a crisis, indicators must be selected which will outline the major infrastructural systems: agriculture, health, social services, etc. # Indicators\n\n# Check Lists\nGenerally, relief agencies want check lists for the information needed in an emergency situation to be as complete as possible. The ideal list does not exist, however."
