"humanitarian crisis; such crises arise from inadequate protection and resources. Nutritional information usually addresses the mothers of small children because the latter suffer from crisis fi rst. Here again, however, an increase in infant mortality does not result from maternal ignorance, but rather from the deterioration of one or more of the following parameters that shape living conditions: 9 available economic resources; 9 the time that can be devoted to small children; 9 access to healthcare; 9 the quality of water and habitat; 9 physical and emotional wellbeing. Information as such is therefore not the priority (it in fact ranks last in the strategy); what matters is the restoration of decent living conditions."
