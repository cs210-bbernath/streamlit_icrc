Readers are therefore referred to Chapter XIII, Section 3.3.5.\n\n# Provision of healthcare\nHealthcare is, in principle, provided within the SFP centre, unless a health centre is located close by and intended also for this purpose. Nevertheless, an SFP centre should always be equipped to dispense basic care. A centre delivering weekly rations cannot provide healthcare. Systematic care is different from individual care. \n# Systematic care\n\n# Measles vaccinations\nMeasles is a particularly virulent disease, often fatal for malnourished children. It can propagate extremely fast in a feeding centre. It is therefore indispensable, systematically upon admission, to vaccinate children previously not vaccinated, doubtful cases and those without vaccination cards."
