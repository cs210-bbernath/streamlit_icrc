"It is in any case essential and compulsory. Soup kitchens provide the ideal setting for:\n9 the detection of sickness and severely malnourished subjects, and their referral to hospitals and therapeutic feeding centres; 9 the conduct of healthcare activities such as vaccination, vitamin A supplementation, parasite treatment, ambulatory healthcare if necessary, and nutritional catch-up monitoring and general nutritional surveillance; 9 the monitoring of the nutritional situation in its broadest sense: crop condition, economic activities, market supply, price trends, etc.; 9 non-food item distributions; 9 training and leisure activities according to the time benefi ciaries spend at the soup kitchen. If no other activities than food distributions are planned, kitchens must be visited by health staff in order to detect possible problems and recommend or take action if necessary. Soup kitchen feeding is not appropriate for small children who are severely malnourished. In the absence of a therapeutic feeding centre, they can be supplied with therapeutic milk 35 in the close vicinity of the soup kitchen. In this case, specialized medical staff must be involved, and at least four to fi ve meals must be supplied per day for a signifi cant impact on malnutrition and mortality. The distribution of therapeutic milk (F-75 Formula) may be required for all kitchen benefi ciaries (i.e. children, adolescents and adults) for a few days if they are all severely malnourished and cannot at fi rst digest the food supplied by the kitchen. # MONITORING AND EVALUATION\nAny GFD programme must be combined with monitoring and evaluation in order to determine: 9 that it is running according to plan and, if not, why not; 9 that it is achieving its objectives and has the intended impact and, if not, why not; 9 its side effects and negative effects, and their reasons; 9 the necessary corrective measures resulting from the three previous points; 9 developments in the situation in general, and that of the nutritional situation in particular, and their consequences for the conduct of the operation. Regular, context-specifi c reporting is necessary to keep track of observations; such reports also invite their authors to keep some distance, and to devote thought to the operation itself. Monitoring and evaluation follow the approach that is described in Chapter X on Assessment. It consists in verifying that benefi ciaries in fact receive the intended ration, what happens to such rations after their distribution (e.g."
