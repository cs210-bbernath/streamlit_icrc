"At most, the population's immune status can be taken into consideration. It had been thought that chemoprophylaxis inhibited the development of natural immunity, but in fact, several studies have shown that this is not the case for children under the age of five years. Chemoprophylaxis is never total, and the subject continues to receive enough exposure to the parasite to develop immunity, even if the immunoglobulin and antibody rates are lower in cases of chemoprophylaxis. # Controlling the Infection at the Biological Stage\nWhen the infected vector has managed to circumvent all obstacles and inject the parasite through the cutaneous barrier, chemoprophylaxis reduces the risk that malaria-disease will develop by neutralizing the pre-erythrocytic forms of the parasite. Although chemoprophylaxis does not prevent malaria absolutelythat could be done only by destroying the sporozoites the moment the vector injected them into the host -it can be used in emergencies. In that case, the relief team must:\n& define a prophylactic regimen The appearance of drug resistance limits the choice of drugs that can be used for chemoprophylaxis. The use of certain drugs normally used for therapeutic ends is inadvisable, due to the risk of fostering resistance. Moreover, consideration must be given to the drug's side-effects which, in some cases, may be serious enough to contraindicate its systematic use in chemoprophylaxis. The choice is limited to chloroquine, proguanil, and chlorproguanil. 60 In each case, the medical team must assess the parasite's resistance, and choose the prophylactic regimen accordingly."
