"Such fortifi ed foods must only be used to complement basic rations, and not for weaning or nutritional catch-up purposes, for which they are not adapted. Fortifi ed foods must also be consumed by all household members. In addition to fortifi ed foods that supply several micro-nutrients, some exist that contain only one (or two at most); these are useful in terms of the micro-nutrient under consideration. Examples include iodized salt, which resolves iodine defi ciency, and vitamin A enriched oil (sometimes also enriched in vitamin D), which are both usually consumed by all household members. The disadvantage of oil is that it is often partly sold, or used in culinary preparations that are later sold; its anticipated impact is therefore not always achieved, especially because losses occur during its transport and storage (5 to 10% depending on circumstances), and when it is used for frying (up to 50%). # Supplying tablets or powders\nIn some circumstances, it may be necessary to supply micro-nutrient tablets or powders to be added to meals after their cooking."
