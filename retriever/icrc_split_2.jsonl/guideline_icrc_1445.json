"acceptable, but would be meaningless for a 3% prevalence rate. The expected prevalence rate raises one of the two diffi culties of understanding of the sampling process (the second being that population size does not infl uence sample size, except for small populations). It seems odd to use a sampling method to determine the prevalence rate of a given variable, when that rate is required as a preliminary for calculating sample size. This involves a preliminary estimation of results, which is infl uenced by the knowledge of the fi eld and of existing problems, or the results of pilot studies."
