"Code of Conduct for Relations between Humanitarian Agencies\nHumanitarian interventions have evolved over the last twenty years. The era of amateurism has given way to the professionalization of the big humanitarian agencies. Although this change may have resulted in a loss of spontaneity, humanitarian operations have, in exchange, gained in efficiency. It should therefore be possible to develop a joint code of conduct for the humanitarian agencies, based on accepted professional principles -although each agency has different interests depending on its mandate, its level of development, the nature of its relations with the States, and its financial means. # Relations between Agencies\nRelations between humanitarian agencies are complex. They depend on the factors described below, as well as the kind of situation involved. # Concentration\nMajor humanitarian emergencies, especially those receiving heavy media coverage, are flooded with humanitarian organizations (governmental, nongovernmental, UN, etc.). # Confusion\nConfusion often arises, especially at the beginning of humanitarian operations, when numerous agencies arrive on the terrain without any precise mandate or objectives. The confusion is greatest concerning the responsibilities that each agency is entitled or obligated to undertake, unless one of them is able to impose a modicum of order. # Consultation\nBefore undertaking a humanitarian action, the potential actors should consult one other to find out their respective plans for a given situation. Unfortunately, it is still all too common for such contacts not to take place until after the humanitarian operations have begun, when participants meet to exchange information about operations in progress. # Conferring\nConferring goes further than mere consultation. It allows the agencies to outline general spheres of action, without actually defining structured plans. # Coordination\nAt this stage, each agency must fit its own operations into the framework of a global strategy, and define objectives that will permit a distribution of intervention programs based on each agency's skills and resources. # Cooperation\nIn the field, cooperation may manifest itself in the sharing of resources or services. Thus, the World Food Programme (WFP) often puts food supplies at the disposal of other organizations; similarly, the ICRC offers logistic assistance to facilitate the work of other agencies. # Contribution\nSome of the humanitarian organizations have no operational capacity."
