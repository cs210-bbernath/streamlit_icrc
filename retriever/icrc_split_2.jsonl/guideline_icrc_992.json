"not sufficient; a whole group of factors must be analyzed. \n# Buying locally\nBuying locally offers several advantages: costs are lower (food, transport, maintenance, etc.), the food is more quickly available (short transport time, no customs duty), and it is better suited to local dietary habits. All these factors make local purchasing very attractive. However, it should be remembered that local buying may unbalance a shaky local market, and that local merchants will refuse to sell their food stocks in order to push prices up. \n# Buying in neighboring countries\nThe risks involved in buying supplies in the bordering regions or countries are the same as for buying locally, though they are less certain and less extensive."
