"Moreover, to implement methods of biological control, major investigations must be carried out first, something which is usually incompatible with an emergency situation. # Controlling the Adult Vector\nThe use of insecticides against vectors 57 has been the basis of most programs of malaria control. This method has not eradicated malaria as was anticipated when it was introduced in the 1950s, but when properly applied it helps reduce malaria transmission significantly. The feasibility of control depends on:\n-previous knowledge of the type and characteristics of the vector, as well as its degree of resistance to insecticides; -a reasonably stable population; -the possibility of finding the necessary material means. There are other ways of controlling adult vectors (chemical sterilization, genetic engineering), but they cannot be applied in emergency situations. # Controlling Transmission from Vector to Man\nTransmission from vector to man is controlled by means of simple measures designed to reduce the possibility of contact between the two. These measures include:\n-measures intended to repel the vector. The use of insect repellent on the exposed parts of the body, clothing, and mosquito nets reduces the number of mosquito bites. -measures intended to prevent contact between vectors and humans. The use of appropriate clothing (long sleeves) protects the skin and prevents bites. -the use of mosquito nets."
