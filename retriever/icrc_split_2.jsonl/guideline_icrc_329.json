"19 In practical terms, the following schedule could be proposed:\n. BCG for children under one year \n\n# Tetanus for women of childbearing age\n& Immunization with BCG is limited to children under the age of one year. ''There has been much controversy in the past about the efficacy of the BCG vaccine. It is now generally accepted that it provides a degree of protection, particularly in young children, against serious forms of the disease such as miliary TB and TB meningitis.'' 20\nThe limits of the target group for immunization against measles should be reviewed in light of many recently published studies on the rate of measles incidence in children under nine months of age. 21 These findings should be weighed against the fact that the vaccine's effectiveness in children under nine months is inhibited by maternal antibodies. Therefore, the standard vaccine most commonly used (Schwartz strain) is recommended only from the age of nine months up. With the advent of a more immunogenic vaccine, the Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) strain, the possibility of immunizing children from the age of six months has been suggested, which would reduce the number of measles cases. 22 The duration of this vaccine's effectiveness, however, has yet to be proven. In October, 1991, a study carried out in Senegal showed that the risk of death in children who had received the EZ vaccine was 1.8 times higher than in children 19 ''Unless previous services are known to have had wide coverage, all children under 5 years may be vaccinated. First priority, however, is for children in the first year of life.'' Ockwell, ed., Assisting in Emergencies (UNICEF), p."
