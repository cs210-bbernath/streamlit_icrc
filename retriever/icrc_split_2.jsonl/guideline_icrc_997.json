"Some agencies are particularly attracted by competition, to the point where it may become their main objective. In this case, the victims' interests come second, which in the end results in interventions that are badly targeted, useless, or even dangerous for the beneficiaries. # Confrontation\nNot infrequently, agencies clash over intervention strategies or the line to take with local authorities. Confrontation is desirable except in the acute phases of operations, for it involves an exchange of opposing points of view which ultimately develops the approach to humanitarian situations. # Types of Relations between Humanitarian Agencies\n\n# Conflict\nA conflict between agencies is apt to ensue when there is confusion over their respective mandates. Of course, relations between agencies can move rapidly from one stage to another, depending on circumstances. Consultation favors coordination, whereas confusion may lead to conflict. The advantages of coordination between different humanitarian agencies are obvious. However, although all the agencies recognize the need for coordination, few of them are willing to accept the resulting constraints: the obligation to respect the mandates of others or the commitments made towards others, joint decision-making, etc. This last point is crucial for the ICRC, since its role as a neutral, independent intermediary obliges it to preserve complete autonomy in its decision-making. In large-scale interventions, the ICRC may coordinate its intervention with those of other agencies; but it cannot be coordinated by them. This intransigence, founded on the demands of neutrality and independence, is not the sole preserve of the ICRC. Each agency has its own criteria for intervention and its own way of operating in the field."
