"the actual prevalence rate n = the actual sample size. In the example used earlier, the factor determining sampling error was 1.96, the sample size was 246 for a 5% sampling error with \u00b1 5% accuracy, and the expected prevalence rate was 20%. Assuming that actual values are in fact as follows:\np = the actual prevalence rate = 35% n = the actual sample size = 220. Then actual accuracy is the following: accuracy = \u00b1 1.96 \u00d7  1/2 = \u00b1 6.3%\nThe fi nal result is thus 35 \u00b1 6.3%, the actual accuracy being \u00b1 6.3% and not \u00b1 5% as suggested by the initially chosen accuracy."
