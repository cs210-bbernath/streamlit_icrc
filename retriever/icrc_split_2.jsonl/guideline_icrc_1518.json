"nutritional status of a given population must be adequately interpreted. However, the magnitude of malnutrition is not to be confused with the seriousness of the nutritional situation. For example, a serious primary wasting rate of 30% indicates a serious malnutrition problem, but if this rate is registered shortly before the harvest, which is anticipated to be exceptionally good, this does not justify alarm as to the overall population's nutritional status. Likewise, a serious primary wasting rate of 10% does not indicate a major malnutrition problem, but if it is recorded shortly before the hungry season, it may justify concern as to the nutritional situation."
