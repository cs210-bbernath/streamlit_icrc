The economic objective: the approach consists in supplying a complement that should permit its exchange for commodities that are considered to be essential by the operating agency and its recipients, with a view to optimizing the utilization of available resources. Such additions may serve as revenue, as general economic support, or as a means of exchange for specifi c and identifi ed goods and services. Consequently, the minimum necessary revenue or the local price of desired goods and services must be clearly established. Basic complements or additions are determined by participatory surveys, and the examination of local markets, in order for relative market values to be set and known before launching distribution. Clearly, the commodities that are most valuable in terms of achieving set goals must be examined closely."
