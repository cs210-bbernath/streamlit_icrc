"A more complex normalization method is described in a WHO manual (WHO, 1983). # Anthropometric indexes and measurement units\nMid-upper arm circumference can provide an indication of the nutritional status for children between 1 and 5 years old on its own, and oedema for all age groups. No other anthropometric variable can provide indications of nutritional status on their own: they must be combined with another variable to provide an index. Moreover, all anthropometric indexes must be compared with reference values that are defi ned from a population of healthy subjects (reference population). Such values are processed in reference tables. 25 Cut-off points must be set for each index in order to defi ne specifi c nutritional status categories. Most nutritional indexes combine so-called dependent variables and independent variables. # MUAC age\nFor the index to have a meaning, the dependent variable must be compared with the reference value that relates to the independent variable. For example, the use of the weight-for-height index involves measuring weight (say 8 kg for a boy) and height (say 80 cm), and comparing the recorded weight with the reference weight value for the subject's height (in this case, 11 kg)."
