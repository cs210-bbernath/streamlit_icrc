"The decision should ultimately be based on medical expertise and adapt to circumstances rather than follow strict guidelines. As for the treatment of septic shock, broad-spectrum antibiotics and fi rst-line treatment must be administered, allowing for second-line treatment in case of failure to respond to fi rst-line therapy. In case of systematic treatment, distinctions must be made between marasmus, marasmus with complications and kwashiorkor. 1. marasmic children with no apparent sign of serious infection and no hypothermia or hypoglycaemia should receive fi rst-line treatment as follows: q Cotrimoxazole (25 mg of sulphamethoxazole + 5 mg of trimethoprim/kg), orally, twice daily for at least 5 days; 2. marasmic children with complications such as hypoglycaemia, hypothermia, septic shock, skin infections, respiratory or urinary tract infections, or lethargy; and 3. kwashiorkor cases with oedematous malnutrition -the presence of oedema is the criterion for systematic antibiotic treatment, whatever the accompanying complications. Complicated marasmus cases and kwashiorkor cases should both receive fi rst-line treatment as follows (the same as for septic shock, as provided in Section 4.1.3 above):\nq Ampicillin: 50 mg/kg (IM or IV) every 6 hours for 2 days, followed by amoxicillin, 15 mg/kg every 8 hours for 5 days (if amoxicillin is unavailable, ampicillin can be given -25 mg/kg every 6 hours); In combination with: q Gentamicin: 7.5 mg/kg (IM or IV) once daily for 7 days. Second-line treatment is necessary if the patient fails to respond, if improvement is weak, or if the patient develops an infection."
