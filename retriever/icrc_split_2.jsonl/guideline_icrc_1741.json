"households absorbs all available resources, the effort can be counter-productive. Finally, targeting only makes sense if the situation is stable, and durably so. Otherwise, targeting procedures must be adapted in line with changes that arise, and this is usually simply impossible. In short, targeting vulnerable communities in situations of crisis is self-evident (but may not be feasible), however targeting specifi c households within a given community is considerably more complicated. Five reasons explain this:\n9 the diffi culty of defi ning economic discrepancies within the community objectively; 9 the diffi culty arising from the acceptability of screening and attempts at diverting resources; 9 the diffi culty of setting acceptable cut-off points that correspond to a tangible reality for the community; 9 the diffi culty of identifying households once cut-off points have been set; 9 crisis dynamics that quickly make targeting modalities obsolete."
