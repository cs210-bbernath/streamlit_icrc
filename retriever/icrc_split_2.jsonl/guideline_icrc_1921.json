It must be strict and disciplined, especially in terms of dosage. \n# Bacterial infections\nThe number of children suffering from respiratory, urinary, and systemic infection upon admission can be very high. This poses a problem insofar as diagnosis upon admission is complicated -hence the question as to whether treatment should simply be systematic. The WHO and MSF are rather in favour of this option (WHO, 1999;MSF, 1995); experience however shows that the answer should vary according to circumstances. In famines, where severe malnutrition is mainly primary and patients are above all malnourished but seldom sick, systematic treatment should be restricted to kwashiorkor cases; marasmus cases on the other hand should be carefully examined upon admission, and treated if infection is demonstrated by clinical signs and/or the patient's history."
