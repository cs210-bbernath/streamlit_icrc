"Figure 10.19 below provides an example of a decision tree. # CHECKLISTS\nChecklists are good reminders of all the different aspects that must not be omitted in an assessment. It is therefore useful to consult them while preparing the assessment, in order not to forget anything, but also after each survey, or data collection exercise, to confi rm that all their points have indeed been covered, or explore avenues related to points that were previously not included in the lists. This being said, it is best not to consult them during assessment proper, as they may sidetrack investigators, or cause them to overlook unexpected aspects. Checklists should not be used as assessment guidelines by inexperienced fi eld staff, because they do not permit the understanding of a given situation, in spite of sometimes giving that impression. 31\n\n# QUESTIONNAIRES\nQuestionnaires permit the systematic collection of information. Like checklists, their use ensures that no aspect is forgotten, and they permit the systematization of the information provided by different sources. However, inexperienced staff risks being closed into restrictive thinking, without the necessary latitude to explore unexpected aspects and adapting their understanding to the progress of the assessment. To improve the usefulness of questionnaires, they should be combined with the obligation for investigators to interpret results; failing that, questionnaires can turn into sterile sources of endless information, as observed all too often. The commonest example is that of market price monitoring: it is usually useless, unless the investigator is specifi cally required to provide explanations as to fl uctuations (or their absence). 31 An example of checklists may be found in Annex 10."
