"Once the necessity of impact evaluation has been acknowledged, what should be evaluated? # Impact on Victims' Health Status\nFor health-care professionals, a program's impact is measured in relation to the objective established at the beginning of the operation (we will not review the details of measurable health indicators here). # Impact on Vital Needs\nThe concept of ''comprehensive needs'' developed previously is appropriate here. A situation may arise where the food distributions have achieved their stated purpose (for example, to return malnutrition to its normal level) but in the meantime have generated perverse effects (such as increased tension between those who receive food aid and those who do not). Arrangements should be made to measure this type of harmful effect on the same basis as malnutrition rates. # Impact on All the Victims\nEvaluation will indicate whether the aid is uniformly distributed among all members of the target population. # Impact of One Program on Another\nWhat one program does may have negative consequences for what another is doing. For example, distributing food tends, in the long run, to make victims irresponsible, fostering a mentality characteristic of chronic aid recipients. Moreover, it may destabilize the local market. Then, if agricultural rehabilitation programs are offered, there will be few takers, since the general feeling will be: ''Why grow anything? We are given food, and, in any case, what we produce won't be worth much on the market.'' ''Ideally, any aid input even in times of emergency should attempt to reduce rather than increase vulnerability. In Lesotho there exist many local copingstrategies, and although clearly compromises, nevertheless provide some protection to individual households. One may, therefore, legitimately inquire whether or not the kind of emergency-response in Lesotho helped to support these local strategies in, for instance, increasing transfer of income between households and providing added social security measures guaranteeing some degree of protection for the destitute. Agricultural practice has its own mechanisms for distributing food and cash and any intervention which blocks these life-saving mechanisms is necessarily counter-productive.'' 12 Evaluating the impact of humanitarian interventions is essential both for the conduct of operations in progress and as an instrument of operational research to achieve a better approach to future operations. To reject the principle of evaluation for the sake of other priorities is unethical."
