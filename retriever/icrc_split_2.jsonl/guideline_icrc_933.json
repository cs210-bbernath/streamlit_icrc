"authorities about the risks of population displacement, and back up their arguments with the legal instruments cited below. # The Protection of Civilian Populations against Forced Displacement\nProtocol II, Article 17, provides:\n''1. The displacement of the civilian population shall not be ordered for reasons related to the conflict unless the security of the civilians involved or imperative military reasons so demand. Should such displacements have to be carried out, all possible measures shall be taken in order that the civilian population may be received under satisfactory conditions of shelter, hygiene, health, safety and nutrition. Keeping civilian populations in their normal environment depends on such factors as security conditions and the scope of ''military necessity.'' Finally, if the civilian population remains on its home ground, its means of subsistence must be protected."
