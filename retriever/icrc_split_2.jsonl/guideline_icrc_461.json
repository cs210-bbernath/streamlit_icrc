"116 This approach is limited, however, by social disorganization and the channeling of resources towards more urgent problems. 116 The measures that combine both approaches to amebiasis control can be listed as follows:\n\n# Reducing Transmission\nTransmission of most internal parasitic diseases reflects the local level of environmental hygiene and the conditions of water supply. 117 Reducing transmission depends on measures focusing on environmental hygiene (human-waste removal); health education; and an improved water supply, encouraging personal hygiene. Depending on the parasitic infections to be controlled, potential measures will vary in importance. The following measures have been classified in order of their importance within the framework of a community approach:\n-ascariasis: waste removal and personal hygiene -ancylostomiasis: waste removal, personal hygiene, and the correction of anemia\nIn evaluating the relative importance of the different options, however, the health team should give thought to the cultural context and acceptability of the proposed measures. 118\n\n# Managing Cases Presenting No Clinical Signs\nCases presenting no clinical signs ascribable to intestinal parasitic infection (such as anemia, abdominal pain, or diarrhea) should not be treated, unless mass treatment is planned as part of a broader control program designed to reduce the parasite burden on the environment. # Managing Clinical Cases Diagnosis\nThe clinical symptoms of intestinal parasitic infections are not specific to them, and it is unrealistic to try to make an etiological diagnosis of every patient with presumptive symptoms who shows up for consultation. Treatment is often empirical. # Treatment of Suspected or Confirmed Cases\nThe advent of short treatments for most intestinal parasitic diseases has simplified the therapeutic approach to amebiasis (Fasigyne), and ascariasis and hookworm (Albendazole). # Mass Treatment\nAccording to WHO, 119 mass treatment can be undertaken in three ways:\n-treatment of the entire population; -treatment of all infected subjects, whether ill or not; -treatment of the groups most susceptible to infection. Mass treatment is justified if the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections is very high -for example, 60-70% for ascariasis. It is only realistic, however, if the population affected is limited and lives in a restricted geographical area."
