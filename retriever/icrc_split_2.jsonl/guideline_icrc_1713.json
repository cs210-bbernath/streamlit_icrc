"15 If manifestations of hypothermia, lethargy and mental disorder appear to indicate hypoglycaemia, immediate action is required in the form of oral administration of:\n4. Treating severe malnutrition 4.1 Initial treatment 9 mild dehydration: its clinical signs are thirst and agitation -fl uid loss is roughly 40 to 50 ml/kg; 9 moderate dehydration: its clinical signs are thirst, irritation, tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), and rare and dark urine -fl uid loss is roughly 60 to 90 ml/kg; 9 severe dehydration: its clinical signs are somnolence or anxiety, an accelerated and weak radial pulse, inelastic skin (persistent skin folds), sunken eyes, and the absence of urine for several hours -fl uid loss is roughly 100 to 110 ml/kg. # Causes of dehydration\nDehydration frequently results from recent and profuse episodes of watery diarrhoea; diarrhoea is thus a good indicator in explaining substantial fl uid loss. If dehydration is suspected, the patient's recent history of diarrhoea episodes must therefore be systematically documented. In a TFC in famine settings however, dehydration may also result from non-pathological losses that are not compensated by adequate fl uid intake. This is commonly noted during admission, in patients who have travelled a long distance in the heat, without proper access to water."
