"Annex 9\n\n# CHOOSING THE REFERENCE AND THRESHOLDS\nThe data usually used to make QUAC sticks are those provided by de Ville de Goyet (de Ville de Goyet, 1978), as indicated in Table A.9.1 below. Moderate malnutrition is indicated by a mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) of less than 85% of the median, and severe malnutrition by one lower than 75% of the median. The 85% cut-off point is usually considered to be overly sensitive, whereas the 75% cut-off point is neither too sensitive nor too specifi c in order to determine severe wasting. 1\nThe US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) reference tables for mid-upper arm circumference (WHO, 1995;Mei, 1997) provide median MUAC-for-age and MUAC-for-height values with their standard deviation. Unfortunately, the standard deviation is low in MUAC-forheight tables (Mei, 1997), causing the -2 Z-scores and especially the -3 Z-scores thresholds to be too sensitive to determine moderate, and especially severe, malnutrition accurately. For example, for a child measuring 92 cm, the -2 Z-scores threshold is 13.9 cm, the -3 Z-scores threshold is 12.8 cm."
