"warning purpose by revealing the inadequacy of the current intervention. In practical terms, the question is whether the palliative SFP implementation criterion should be malnutrition thresholds -for instance, more than 15% of children rating two standard deviations less than the median weight-for-height index value. The answer should be negative -once again, the situation's specifi city and common sense should take precedence over arbitrary thresholds. In targeting moderate malnutrition specifi cally, the rate of this malnutrition will infl uence the decision to intervene less than the potential number of benefi ciaries will, which can only increase as the crisis develops and preventive measures remain ineffective."
