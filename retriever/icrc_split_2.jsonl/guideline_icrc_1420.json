"random sampling is illustrated in Figures 10.5 and 10.6 below. Figure 10.5 Simple random sampling -example 1 16 Of course, these are not perfect random numbers because they are generated using an algorithm, but they are near enough for all practical purposes. In the case of EXCEL computer spreadsheets, all the names, or subject identities, are pasted in one column; the next column should then contain the function =RAND() -this produces random numbers between 0 and 1, which can then be sorted. In Figure 10.5, the subjects are numbered and randomly pre-selected; in Figure 10.6 they are not identifi ed individually prior to sampling, but are selected according to a general random direction, within an area that is suffi ciently homogenous for all individuals to be representative of the overall population."
