"shelter and health is based on physiological and social needs. \n# Health Risks\nThe relation between nutritional needs and inadequate housing has been studied in particular by J. Rivers, who writes, ''The fact that famine-affected populations often have reduced amounts of clothing and limited shelter can be very important because of its impact on energy requirements.'' 51\nIn a situation where access to food is problematic, contending with the cold requires an additional caloric intake. 52 Thus, the absence of means of protection from the cold favors the development of malnutrition and increases mortality linked to hypothermia, which itself is fostered by malnutrition."
