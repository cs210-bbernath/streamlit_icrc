"The decision to choose one site rather than another must be made with due consideration of all the factors weighed together. # Organization of a Site\nThe accepted space standard in a camp is an average area of 30 m 2 per person. This area comprises the actual dwelling space and the necessary space for community infrastructures (distribution areas, dispensaries, etc.). Usually the camp residents settle in by themselves before an administrative body can design a general plan for the camp. Whether organizers have the good fortune to be able to control the physical arrangement of the dwellings from the outset or whether they are obliged to restructure a haphazard settlement, the following general principles apply. # Organization of Housing\nIn a camp, the shelters are uniform, basic units lined up in rows; each family or group of families should have reasonably convenient access to latrines and water. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) recommends, for example, that latrines be available within a radius of 50 meters, and water within about 100 meters. 59 If necessary, the camp can be divided into zones according to different ethnic groups."
