Patients may drink from the mug directly, or use a spoon; both methods have advantages and drawbacks. The author recommends the use of spoon at the beginning of initial treatment, when carers or assistants feed children; this option improves control over the process and keeps it slow, which reduces the risk of vomiting. As children regain their appetite, the use of mugs is probably preferable, because it speeds the process up, and reduces spillage, which can be collected in a saucer."
