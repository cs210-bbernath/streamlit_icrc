"During the fi rst months, the child should be fed on demand, which varies considerably from one child to another. This demand is natural and legitimate, and must be satisfi ed -it is a guarantee for the child's mental and physical health.

In this respect, man only differs from other mammals because its offspring is not mobile shortly after birth, and can therefore not seek its mother's teat independently."
