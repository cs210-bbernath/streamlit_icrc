"water pumped directly from a river), it must be treated. For proper treatment, whatever the technique (filtration, chemical treatment), the water must be stored. The storage area will depend on geography and the configuration of the distribution network that will be integrated with it. Ideally, distribution will be gravity-fed from the storage unit. \n# Size of the Population\nDirect distribution at the source (a well equipped with a hand pump, for example) is satisfactory if the population is relatively small. But if the number of people depending on one source of water is high, there is a risk of ''traffic jams!'' The solution is to channel the water into a reservoir, whence it will flow into a network with a variable number of outlets, depending on the size of the population."
