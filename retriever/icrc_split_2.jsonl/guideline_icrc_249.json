"The aim is to achieve the best possible compromise between the desired health benefits and the constraints of the situation. # Use\nA number of factors influence the proper use of water. # Technical Characteristics of the System\nIf the system functions badly (supply cuts), if it is badly planned (distribution points are too far away from users), or if it does not accord with local sociocultural habits, it will not be used. 39 ''When water is available within about 1 km or within half-an-hour's return journey of the home, water use does not significantly increase when the distance or time is reduced, unless it is less than 100 m. When the point is reached where a tap can be provided within each house, water use may increase dramatically from 10-30 l to 30-100 l/person.''
