"Another important step is reorganizing the health-care services:\n''Disasters hinder development by destroying the infrastructure and by using up the health services' scanty resources for emergencies or rehabilitation. However, they also provide an opportunity to genuinely reform and improve the health system, because they encourage such changes as better distribution of services or a shift from large hospitals to comprehensive and decentralized health services. Such measures were adopted in Mexico City during the reconstruction of the hospitals destroyed by the earthquake.'' 51\n\n# Floods\nHere again, the connection with underdevelopment is obvious: populations concentrated in fertile but high-risk areas, absence of dams or dikes to hold back flood waters, flimsy housing which will not stand up to flooding. Environmental vulnerability could conceivably be reduced, through reforestation and the construction of dams and water reservoirs."
