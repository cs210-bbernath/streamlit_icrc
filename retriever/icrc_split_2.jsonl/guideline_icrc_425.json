"solutions. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) reduces mortality by preventing dehydration. A study carried out in Papua-New Guinea showed that the mortality rate fell from 3.3 per 1,000 to 1.3 per 1,000 after the institution of an oral rehydration program. 77 ORT is applicable in all emergency situations. In such situations, however, it is best to use solutions made from preprepared packets of rehydration salts, 78 rather than base a program on the constitution of solutions from ingredients found on the spot. Such packets should be widely distributed to all families. At the same time, an education program must be instituted to teach mothers how to use them properly."
