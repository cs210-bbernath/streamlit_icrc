"-The political situation may impose restrictions on the organization of the program (curfews, insecurity, etc.) -Resource requirements (staff, facilities, financing) become heavier as programs become more complex. -Favorable progress by the program's beneficiaries (which is the aim of the program) creates organizational problems, since the program has to be continually adapted to accommodate that progress (by changes in diet, scheduling of meals, etc.) throughout the patient's stay. 73 Details concerning the preparation of nutritious foods and mixtures used in nutrition rehabilitation centers are available in many manuals and will not be reviewed here. -The number of children likely to need the program may pose a problem, since, obviously, the more complex a program is, the fewer the children it will be able to treat. All these aspects must be taken into account in the planning stage of an NRP. # EXAMPLES OF CHOICES IN NUTRITIONAL REHABILITATION STRATEGY\n. Zone 1, a few cases of moderate malnutrition: supplementary feeding + hygienic measures to improve the environment. . Zone 2 + Zone 4, a few cases of severe malnutrition and many cases of moderate malnutrition: supplementary feeding, hygienic and environmental sanitation measures, and treatment of severe cases in an existing facility (for example, a hospital). . Zone 4 + Zone 3, many cases of moderate and severe malnutrition: supplementary feeding and environmental hygiene measures for the moderate cases, and treatment of severe cases in therapeutic feeding centers especially designed for that purpose. # Classification of NRPs\nNutrition rehabilitation programs can be classified according to the number of meals beneficiaries receive per day, ranging from four to eight. Experience shows that they can be divided into two categories:\n& Category I -This program provides four to six meals a day. & Category II -This program offers beneficiaries up to eight meals per day, as needed. This constitutes a therapeutic feeding program. Nutritional programs that offer only two meals a day are inadequate to effect satisfactory cures for the severe forms of malnutrition. This outline provides a basis for planning the facilities that will be needed. At this point nutrition rehabilitation centers (NRCs) come into the picture. # Nutrition Rehabilitation Centers\nUnder What Circumstances Should an NRC Be Built? In deciding whether an NRC will be required, planners should consider two factors: the expected number of beneficiaries and the potential of existing local facilities. # Number of local beneficiaries\nIf the problem is limited to a few cases of malnutrition, it is usually possible to have them admitted to a local health facility. Serious nutritional emergencies involving large populations, in contrast, produce a heavy ''demand'' for nutritional care. In this case, the establishment of facilities designed expressly to meet that demand must be considered."
