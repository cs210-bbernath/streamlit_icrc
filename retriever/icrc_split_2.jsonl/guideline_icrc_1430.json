"column 5 indicates the number of clusters in each section. Table 10.3 below is based on the example of a total population of 30,000 subjects. The number of clusters per section is then defi ned in order to complete column 5; this is done by defi ning an interval size \"a\" that amounts to the total population divided by the total number of clusters \"k\" (in this example, 30). The interval size in the above example is 30,000 / 30 = 1,000. A number is randomly selected between 1 and 1,000 to provide the starting point for cluster selection, say 455."
