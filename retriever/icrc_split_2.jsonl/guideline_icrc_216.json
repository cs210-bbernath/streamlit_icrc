"conditions affect the quantities of water that can be provided. Obviously, in desert regions where water is scarce and therefore precious, it will be doled out parsimoniously, or at least according to the minimum standards. Finally, the technical characteristics of the water distribution network influence the quantities of water used by a population. Many studies on such factors as the distances between water-supply points and the consumer's home have shown a relation between the quantity of water used and the distance the user needs to go to fetch it. Water use is maximal when it is available within the home."
