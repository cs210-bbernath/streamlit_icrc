The next section will cover the technical principles involved in a water-supply system. # Water-Supply Techniques\nIn disaster situations, water-supply systems are often partially destroyed, or the materials necessary to maintain them are lacking. In such cases, relief workers must determine to what extent the missing elements can be replaced."
