"The possibility of over-hydration nevertheless warrants special attention: its signs are an increased respiratory rate, engorged jugular veins, or a distended abdomen. Over-hydration calls for the immediate suspension of the treatment. ReSoMal given to maintain hydration in the case of persisting diarrhoea must be administered in amounts that are equivalent to the volume of the stool, until diarrhoea stops. In case of persisting vomiting, ReSoMal must be administered by NG tube. As soon as the patient becomes alert and is willing to drink, larger amounts of ReSoMal may be administered, but at longer intervals: this is in order to avoid vomiting and an undue acceleration of the overall rehydration rate. In the course of rehydration, patients must also resume feeding as quickly as possible, that is, as soon as they become alert. Breastfeeding is the best approach, and the child should be encouraged to feed every 20 to 30 minutes from the onset of rehydration. It is worth reiterating here that breastfeeding is an absolute priority in the treatment of severe malnutrition, in all circumstances. Furthermore, F-75 Formula should be given as soon as possible (usually 2 to 3 hours after starting rehydration). As soon as the rehydration frequency diminishes with larger amounts of ReSoMal and feeding resumes, ReSoMal is alternated with F-75 Formula. There is no risk of excess mineral concentrations if ReSoMal is alternated with F-75 Formula, especially in the case of potassium; both solutions in fact share roughly the same mineral concentration, which corresponds to requirements. However, ReSoMal must never be combined with F-75 Formula in the same solution, as this would double the potassium concentration and this could be fatal."
