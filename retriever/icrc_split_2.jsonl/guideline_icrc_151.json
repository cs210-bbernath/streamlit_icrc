"constraints and nutritional factors reduce the choice of possible foods. The complete basic ration 57 generally consists of:\n-cereals = 400 grams -legumes = 100 grams -oil = 50 grams\nThe choice of foods making up a food ration must also, of course, take into consideration the cultural characteristics of the society concerned. Since a ration of this type does not meet vitamin requirements, additional measures must be contemplated, such as the distribution of vitamin A. 56 The terms used for this type of ration vary according to the organization. For the sake of simplicity, they can be called partial rations, to distinguish them from complete rations."
