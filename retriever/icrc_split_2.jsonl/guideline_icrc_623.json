"tendency. The arithmetic mean is the most commonly used measure. 17 \n\n# Distribution Curve\nIf all the individual values for a given population are represented on a graph, the result is the classic or ''normal'' distribution curve (Gaussian curve), with the arithmetic mean as its center. The individual values will be distributed around the mean, spreading out more or less in relation to the latter. \n# Measures of Variability\nIn a given population, each individual value will be a different distance from the mean. On the basis of this fact, the degree to which these values vary from the mean can be determined by calculations of various kinds, ranging from the simplest to the most complex."
