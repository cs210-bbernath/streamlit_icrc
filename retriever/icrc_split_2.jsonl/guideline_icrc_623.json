"14 In the presentation of results, care should be taken to distinguish between incidence and prevalence. # Rates\nNo conclusions can be drawn from the mere knowledge that there are 200 malnourished children in a particular population. This fact must be expressed in the form of a rate, defined by a numerator (the number of malnourished children) and a denominator (the total number of children in the age group examined). The significance of the malnutrition rate will vary depending on whether it is 400/ 5,000 (4%) or 200/1,000 (20%). The rates most commonly used in emergency situations are:\n. the mortality rate\nthe malnutrition rate\nthe rate of incidence of the most common diseases. 15 Percentages are also used to describe the utilization of health services, as in the rate of occupation for hospital beds, or the rate of immunization coverage. # Difficulties in Emergency Situations\nIn emergency situations, it is often difficult to determine the denominator, especially in widely dispersed, mobile populations. This problem is compounded by political manipulations reflected in the exaggeration or minimization of the estimated number of victims. Determining the numerator is hardly an easier task, given the unreliability of information sources; it is difficult to obtain exact estimations of the incidence of communicable diseases, the number of deaths, and other data. # Distribution of Data\nAs mentioned previously, indicators must be defined in terms of three characteristic parameters: person, time, and space. The importance of this is reflected in the presentation of data, which shows the characteristics of the people studied (age, sex, ethnic group, social group), the time of data collection (season), and the geographical area (rural zone, urban zone, etc.)."
