"regions where subjects are geographically distributed (this facilitates their location). 9 Cluster random sampling is recommended for large, scattered populations that may not be homogenous, without it being possible or necessary to defi ne more homogenous sub-groups. \n# Sample size\nThe underlying principle here is that, whatever the issue under investigation, the size of the population from which the sample is taken is infi nite. As a result, the size of the sample is not determined by the size of the population. Exceptions exist, in the case of small groups whose size is well known; in such cases, the sample size may be recalculated (see below)."
