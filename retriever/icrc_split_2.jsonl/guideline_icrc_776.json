"Nonetheless, for the system to function well, solid coordination must be achieved between the different parties involved in its operation. In refugee camps, the country's health ministry and the HCR are usually responsible for this coordination. # Equitable Distribution of Care\nThe geographical distribution of health services should cover the majority of the population. The issue of equity also arises when the care provided by humanitarian agencies to displaced people is clearly superior to that provided to the resident population by the local health-care system. Moreover, the local health services may be inaccessible to the population for financial reasons (high cost or lack of social security coverage). This, too, may raise the issue of equity, insofar as the emergency health services are free. Discriminatory provision of health care is a major problem in situations of armed conflict. Depending on their affiliation to one side or the other, victims may be denied access to health-care services. # Accessibility\nThe criterion of accessibility encompasses many of the points mentioned above. It merits special attention, however, for it is the key factor in most situations of armed conflict. 18 \n\n# Accessibility and Geographical Location\nThe farther away health services are from the population, the less they are used. 19 In developing countries, installing health-care facilities such as dispensaries or hospitals in immediate proximity to the homes of all the potential patients is a utopian dream. In these countries, the remoteness of health centers is a problem difficult to surmount. In disaster situations, when communications are even more trouble-ridden than usual, the gap between health facilities and victims becomes even wider. A few comments should be made about the institution of mobile teams which visit villages and displaced-person camps every two to four weeks for a more direct access to victims. This approach is indicated for prophylactic activities such as immunizations and hygiene programs, which do not require daily follow-up. Mobile teams that deliver medical care, in contrast, do nothing to control serious cases of disease, because access to the population is too sporadic. A child's chances of being saved will depend on whether he comes down with pneumonia a few hours before or a few hours after the team passes through. Access to the victims is not only a matter of contact at regular intervals, but also of continuity in the relations between the health-care services and those who need them."
