"In that case, the protein complement supplies the lacking protein -it is no longer then a matter of balancing the amino-acid intake, but in fact the basic protein intake. In view of the respective contributions of the legume, tuber, and lipid contents to satisfying the protein and energy requirements, close to 200 g of legumes must be supplied in order to meet the protein requirement. The energy supplied by the staple food then accounts for 57 to 42% of the ration if the energy complement provides between 15 and 30%. It is worth noting that low-extraction cereal fl our and polished, non-steamed rice lack vitamins and minerals, and must be complemented accordingly, which can be done with legumes. 16 In terms of nutritional information, target groups must be made aware of the dangers of overly refi ned cereals, in addition to supplying them with complements to compensate the losses resulting from refi ning. # Protein\nThe protein complement in the form of legumes should be approximately 60 to 200 g (200 to 680 kcal (840 to 2 840 kJ)), according to whether the staple is in the form of cereal or a protein-poor tuber. It may be supplied by way of other protein-rich foodstuffs -what then matters is to ensure the protein equivalent of what the legumes supply, that is, approximately 15 g of protein if the latter complement cereals, or 45 g if they complement the abovementioned tubers. In both cases, correction factors must be applied that allow for the digestibility and biological utilization of protein."
