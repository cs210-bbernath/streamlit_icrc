"This implies that the logistics supply chain can indeed run smoothly, and that its staff is informed in time of the required amounts to be delivered to specifi c distribution points. Recipients must be involved in the distribution planning phase, especially in striking the best balance between distribution frequency and the amounts to be carried home. Full rations should be distributed at least once a month if the population must carry it on foot. As a reminder, full rations for one month weigh roughly 18 kg; a family of fi ve, of which three are infants (and, thus, cannot carry their ration), must then carry away 90 kg at once, that is, 45 kg per adult -this is extreme. The frequency of distribution rounds must therefore be set by referring to common sense, and adapt to circumstances. If recipients face a fourday journey on foot to reach distribution points, they can hardly be expected to undertake such a journey more than once a month. In camp settings, on the other hand, it may be most practical to conduct distributions on a weekly basis."
