This, of course, can be done only if diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and criteria for inter-level transfer have been rationalized, standardized, and well-formulated in advance. \n# Integration of the Preventive and Curative Levels\nPrimarily curative activities are unlikely to influence the health status of a disaster-stricken population. They will save a certain number of victims, of course, and the media will have the opportunity to present dramatic features about ''the fantastic work done by medical teams working under horrifying conditions''; but, overall, the health situation will not change much.
