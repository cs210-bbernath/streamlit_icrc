Humanitarian aid must strive to meet all needs for aid involving economic goods and services necessary for survival, in order to prevent the use of food to other ends than nutritional, or its exchange for essential foodstuffs that are not supplied through GFD. That being said, it is well-known that people utilize donated resources in their own best interest, which reaches far beyond immediate survival."
