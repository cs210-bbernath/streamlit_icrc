"As a result, the frequency can be adjusted, as can the number of spoonfuls that are administered at a set frequency. The author recommends the latter option (adjusting quantities while observing a set frequency), which corresponds to the posology indicated in Table 13.3 below, based on a rehydration of 85 ml per kg of body weight, administered at 5-minute intervals over 12 hours 19 with a standard teaspoon. Upon admission, severely malnourished patients are usually weak, apathetic, and exhausted, and are unwilling to drink. If they cannot be coaxed or forced to drink, ReSoMal may exceptionally be administered by NG tube, at the rate indicated in Table 13.3 above. Rehydration is completed when the patient is no longer thirsty and passes urine."
