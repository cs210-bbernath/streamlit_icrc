"-Does the population concerned already possess a certain immunity? In the case of a displaced population, information can be sought as to its previous exposure, stable or otherwise, to a given species of malaria parasite. -Is the parasite concerned susceptible to the standard drugs? # Quantitative Evaluation\nThe numerous factors mentioned previously interact in a complex manner, and it is difficult to define the problem of malaria quantitatively. Attempts may, however, be made to quantify:\n-The prevalence of the parasitemia Prevalence of the parasitemia can be measured directly from a sampling of the population. This measurement will indicate what percentage of the population presents Plasmodium in the blood. 50 The measurement of the prevalence of gametocytes in the blood indicates the percentage of infectious people. 51 -The vector's capacity to transmit malaria The vector's capacity to transmit malaria depends on various factors, including the density of the vector in the human environment, the number of times it bites humans per day, its survival rate, and the period of incubation inside the vector. Estimating these factors is the job of an entomologist, who should be called in for the purpose. -The degree of transmission The degree of transmission can be measured by means of the splenic index in children from two to nine years old. Together with the plasmodic index (subjects carrying Plasmodium), it indicates the type of endemic involved. 52 -The population's degree of immunity There are many tests to detect the presence of antibodies. These techniques are not very practical in an emergency situation, although large-scale studies have been made in remote regions. 53 The degree of immunity can also be estimated by indirect methods, such as measuring malaria-related morbidity and mortality. -The measurement of mortality must take account of age A mortality rate associated primarily with children below the age of five years and pregnant women indicates that the overall population, with the exception of these vulnerable groups, has a certain immunity. A mortality which is distributed among all age sectors, on the other hand, is the earmark of a nonimmune population confronted by a high level of contagiousness. This distinction makes it possible to quantify not the number of malaria cases that can be expected, but the size of the groups at risk: children under age five, pregnant women, or the entire population. Mortality figures can be obtained directly from the population (evaluation of mortality on the basis of symptoms) and from any existing health services. # Control Measures\nControl programs are established on the basis of the disease cycle and with due consideration for the feasibility of the technical measures proposed."
