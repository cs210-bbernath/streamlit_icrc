"# PHYSICAL REHABILITATION\nPhysical rehabilitation helps restore the functional capacity of people who have lost limbs or injured spinal cords, allowing them to carry on as normal a life as possible. It includes both the provision of arti cial limbs and other assistive devices which can restore lost capacity and physiotherapy to enable patients learn how to use these assistive devices. It enables people with disabilities to resume their lives independently, to work and to reintegrate into family and community activities. \n# ICRC SUPPORT\nIn 2004, the ICRC in cooperation with the International Nepal Fellowship (INF) started assisting the Green Pastures Hospital in Pokhara."
