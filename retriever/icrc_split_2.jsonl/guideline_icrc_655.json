"defined with a confidence level of 95% (z = 1.96). The opposite situation involves two populations presenting different true means (for example, 8% and 17%). Due to sampling errors, the value obtained for the sample from the first population may be 12% (mean + z SE), while the value for the sample from the second population is 13% (mean -SE). The two values are dangerously close, to the point where they are equated with each other. In this case, the affirmation that the two populations are identical is an ''error of the second kind,'' or type II error. The risk of error can be reduced by increasing the value of z."
