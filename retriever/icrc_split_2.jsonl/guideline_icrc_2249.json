"-failing that, the TFC operation is useless and ethically unacceptable. TFC are often restricted to children under 5 for practical and also cultural reasons:\n9 this age group is the fi rst to show signs of malnutrition in a developing crisis; 9 in small children, malnutrition is often complicated by concomitant health disorders; 9 children under 5 cannot survive independently. The nutritional situation in a given region can deteriorate to the point that its entire population is severely malnourished. In such cases, it is clearly best to revise the usual age criterion for admission, because older children are easier to treat, their chances of survival after their discharge are greater (as they have already survived the hazards of infancy), and they represent a considerable emotional and economic investment -affected groups in fact often set this dimension as the priority."
