"rations by 10 to 15%, and improving their adequacy accordingly. In such extreme circumstances, the foodstuffs chosen for inclusion must have the highest possible energy content (i.e. cereals, legumes, oil, biscuits, and CSB), and canned foods should be avoided. Spices and seasonings and, possibly, coffee or tea, should nevertheless be included, and fresh products should also be supplied if they are locally available. In principle, biscuits and CSB should fully complement basic rations in terms of micro-nutrients, failing which powders or tablets must be supplied.  a Ration 7 is an example of a ration in which only basic foods can be included."
