"It will be asking participating National Societies to support surveillance systems for gathering information and the costs of the carrying out of early, comprehensive surveys. They will also be asked to support earlier programme intervention and schemes for the strengthening of operational capacity/preparedness. # A) Disaster preparedness and prevention\ni The Red Cross should establish through its network of National Societies, contacts with other institutions and agencies involved in the collection of data, which provide an early warning of developing nutritional emergencies. Such information will be used to supplement and assist with the interpretation of subsequent surveys in the area, and will help to ensure an effective, appropriate and above all, timely response. ii The Red Cross/Crescent will use standardized techniques for nutritional assessment. The collection of accurate and reliable nutritional data is an integral part of the initial survey. This information will be essential for determining the type of response (if any) to be made, and will provide a baseline against which the effectiveness of any nutritional intervention can be measured. iii Standard terminology must be used in all nutritional reports. iv The Red Cross/Crescent must develop the technical and management expertise necessary to implement effective relief programmes. This will require the employment and training of suitable personnel e.g. nutritionists, engineers and health professionals. Contacts should be made with institutions and individuals who have experience in the relevant fi elds so that they may make a contribution to improving the Red Cross capacity for responding effectively in nutritional emergencies. Emphasis should be given to utilizing local expertise. # B) Emergency relief i Initial assessment\nA Red Cross programme in response to nutritional emergencies must be based on comprehensive surveys organized by the National Society affected using experienced personnel. The initial survey must assess the level of malnutrition, analyse the causes and indicate what resources are either available or are required to deal with the emergency. ii Planning\nAfter consideration of the information resulting from the initial survey the decision to intervene or not will be made. If intervention is to be made a comprehensive plan of action must be drawn up covering the requirements for supplies, personnel, funding and giving indications of the type of programme to be established, given the constraints of the situation and the activities of other agencies. The initial planning should take into consideration the long-term needs of the affected community. iii Intervention\nRecognizing that vulnerability is greatly increased if a population migrates from their normal environment, early intervention is recommended, with emphasis placed on support to the family unit. Priority should be given to the provision of adequate supplies of water and food, the prevention of measles, Vitamin A defi ciency and diarrhoeal diseases and attention to other priority health problems. NUTRITION MANUAL ANNEXES Annex 6\niv Food supplies Food donated or bought for the purposes of relief distribution must be subject to the conditions and principles outlined in the food donation policy. v Nutrition programmes a) Provision of basic rations When food is needed, an adequate basic ration must be assured either by the Red Cross complementing the available food, or when necessary, by taking the responsibility for the full ration. Whether wholly or partly responsible for the basic ration, the Red Cross must ensure that there is an adequate basic ration for all family members. This basic ration must take into consideration the many factors, which may affect the nutritional requirements of different communities. It must be calculated so that it enables the population to sustain reasonable activity as well as normal growth and should also allow a margin for nutritional rehabilitation. During a relief operation, specifi c technical advice is essential for food distribution if the basic ration is inadequate. b) The care of the malnourished Every effort must be made to assist these groups through the basic ration distribution rather than by setting up separate programmes: given suffi cient quantities of appropriate food and adequate support, mothers are the best people to rehabilitate mildly or moderately malnourished children. The initiation of a therapeutic feeding programme should depend on the place which severe malnutrition takes in the overall hierarchy of health priorities. # c) Community health workers\nThe training and supervision of community health workers is an essential part of any nutritional intervention programme. They will ensure early \"case fi nding\", follow-up of malnourished individuals, nutrition education and surveillance. Community health workers will also be fundamental to the development of primary healthcare activities. # vi Surveillance and evaluation\nThe effectiveness of nutritional interventions must be monitored regularly using standard methods. The results should be compared with the objectives outlined in the original plan of action and programmes should be modifi ed in response to this information. Phasing out of nutritional interventions should be considered when the criteria established in the original plan of action have been met. At this stage, it will be essential to further strengthen development activities, which will reduce the vulnerability of the affected population. # vii Development of National Societies\nDuring all phases of responding to nutritional emergencies every opportunity should be taken to increase the National Societies' capacity to plan, implement monitor and evaluate relief operations.
