"In other words, the simple fact that a GFD has achieved its objectives is not suffi cient to terminate the operation. For example, a given population may face insuffi cient access to food, and the GFD objectives are thus to restore access and avoid a deterioration of the nutritional status; nevertheless, once these objectives have been achieved the GFD remains necessary until the causes of this inadequate access have been resolved. On the basis of these two criteria the termination of a GFD is usually predictable, depending on knowledge of the seasonal, climatic, economic, and political developments that affect the access to food and economic self-suffi ciency of the benefi ciaries. # NUTRITION MANUAL\nChapter XII -General food distribution 2. Planning GFD 2.9 Resource mobilization\n\n# RESOURCE MOBILIZATION\nThe author is not an expert in the mobilization of resources, and the issue reaches beyond the scope of this Manual; as such, it is discussed only briefl y here. Resource mobilization involves the collection of means in cash and kind, the logistics set-up (food transport, storage, and distribution), the purchase and hire of goods and services, and the recruitment of competent staff. # Obtaining means\nFor donors to commit the necessary means for a GFD, they must be convinced of its relevance and approve the chosen approach. Persuasion is rather simple, provided that reliable and documented data is available to support the operation, that the justifi cation for the operation rests on its underlying humanitarian principles, that reporting is context-specifi c, and that donors deal with competent staff."
