Figure 10.12 Variables infl uencing budget balance\n\n# APPRAISING THE RESOURCES TO SECURE FOOD\nGraphic illustration helps to appraise the gap between the resources available to secure food and household needs. The fi gure below refl ects food availability within the household, in terms of needs and for an identical production and consumption frequency. The abscissa (or x-axis) indicates food production and the food reserves available for consumption expressed in calories; the ordinate (or y-axis) refl ects the purchasing power available to secure food on the market, expressed in monetary units. The average household calorie requirement is then estimated, and converted into its cash equivalent in local market prices, in compliance with eating habits. The resulting calorie value is indicated on the abscissa, the resulting cash value is indicated on the ordinate, and a straight line is drawn to connect them: this is the price line. This approach permits the appraisal of real food availability, by combining the amount of food (expressed in calories) that the household has produced, gathered or stored and Age is not always easy to ascertain if births are not systematically registered and in the absence of health cards. Mothers must in such cases be consulted, and they may not remember the exact birth date of their child."
