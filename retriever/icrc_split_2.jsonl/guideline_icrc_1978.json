"breastfeeding women, the sick, the elderly, and moderately malnourished children. Supplements were calculated to supply approximately 350 kcal (1,500 kJ) and 15 grammes of protein per person, per day. In practice, a rift resulted between agencies using (frequently insuffi cient) GFDs and those preferring SFPs. Both theory and practice have sometimes led to disaster when the basic ration was inadequate (or even non-existent), and supplementary feeding programmes in fact supplemented very little, if anything. The consequence was a real eye-opener: the basis for relief, in an acute nutritional crisis, must be adequate GFD (IDS, 1986). In this case, SFPs become redundant, except at the very beginning of the intervention, until the GFD logistics set-up is effective, or if the GFD (albeit adequate to cover maintenance needs) does not allow nutritional recovery."
