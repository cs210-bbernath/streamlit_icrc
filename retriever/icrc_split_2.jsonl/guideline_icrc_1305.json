"9 the signal amounts to harm caused by such phenomena. \n# Verifying the possible impact of phenomena\nThe underlying hypothesis that phenomena infl uence the feeding process (or may do so) is tested by: 9 identifying the region where the phenomena occur or have occurred; 9 identifying the affected population; 9 attempting to determine which groups may present vulnerabilities according to existing risk factors; 9 verifying the existence of such vulnerabilities; 9 attempting to determine whether such vulnerabilities have given rise to such phenomena in the past and, if so, with what type of harm; or if they may do so in future, and with what likely harm."
