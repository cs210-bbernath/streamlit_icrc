"size for a sample, investigators must respect certain basic principles. & The concept of sampling error: Where the entire population is surveyed and the mean is calculated, the result obtained is the true value of the mean (Xp). If, instead, sampling is employed and the mean (Xe) is calculated from the data collected from the sample, the value obtained will deviate more or less from the true mean. If the sampling process is repeated, each time with the same number of subjects, each time a mean (Xe 1 , Xe 2 , Xe 3 , etc.) will be obtained that deviates + from the true mean (Xp)."
