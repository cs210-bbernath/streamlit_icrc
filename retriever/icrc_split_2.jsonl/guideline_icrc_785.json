"of disaster is not as common as might be imagined. Indeed, to apply financial means immediately to urgent needs, the necessary resources (material, logistic, and personnel) must be available in the country -something which is by no means always the case. Donors prefer to import the necessary resources directly, both for reasons of efficiency and in their own interests, rather than to give local authorities the financial wherewithal to buy abroad and import what they lack. Nonetheless, the humanitarian agencies do employ this means of intervention, on a limited scale. They may, for example, undertake to pay the salaries of the local personnel recruited for the emergency situation."
