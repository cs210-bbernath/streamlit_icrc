"statistical analysis of data. # Tools Relating to Data Distribution\nThe previous section showed the importance of characteristics in data distribution: persons, place, etc. Data distribution involves entire population groups which will subsequently be compared with each other. 16 A way must be found of distributing individual data within each population group, to facilitate comparison between them. For a given population, the procedure is first to calculate the indices of central tendency (means), and then to establish the distribution of all the individuals in that population around the mean (index of dispersion). This, then, represents an individual distribution of data, as opposed to the distribution by population group studied previously. On the basis of these indices, comparisons can be made using tests adapted to the data-collection method (significance tests). # Measures of Central Tendency\nCentral tendency is calculated in the form of a mean. It defines the median axis around which are gathered the set of individual values in the population studied. The median of a set of observations is the value located ''physically'' in the middle of the set. The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a set of observations. # Applications in Emergency Situations\nEmergency situations are no different from normal situations as regards choosing an index of central tendency."
