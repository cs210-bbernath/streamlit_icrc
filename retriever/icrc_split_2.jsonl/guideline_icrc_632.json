"sampling), or a list of all the clusters (cluster sampling).  23 The sampling interval is calculated by dividing the total population by the number of clusters provided for in the sample. The choice between the different sampling methods will depend on various considerations:\n-geographical distribution of the population -In a displaced-person camp where an entire, homogeneous population is concentrated in a restricted space, simple random sampling is adequate. If the population comprises subgroups with different characteristics (for example, ethnic or regional origin, date of arrival in the camp), stratified sampling is the method of choice. If small population groups are scattered over large areas, then cluster sampling is preferable."
