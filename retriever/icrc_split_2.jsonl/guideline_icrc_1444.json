"to know where exactly in that interval it is located. Usually, the sampling error is set at 5%; in other words, it is accepted that there are 5 chances out of 100 that the real value is not included in the confi dence interval at all. The confi dence interval itself is determined by the intended accuracy: a 5% accuracy around the experimental result is usually considered as acceptable, but this depends on circumstances. For example, in comparing results with those obtained six months before, confi dence intervals must not overlap, and this may require smaller confi dence intervals. Moreover, a 5% confi dence interval around a 50% prevalence rate is perfectly acceptable, but would be meaningless for a 3% prevalence rate."
