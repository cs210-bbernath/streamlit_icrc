"period (this period varies according to the amount of water). Residual free chlorine is easily measured: following the required contact period, 0.5 mg of free chlorine per litre of water should remain -this amount is usually effective against possible subsequent contamination. However, the transfer of purifi ed water to unclean containers can deplete residual free chlorine entirely resulting in the preservation of some pathogens. Consequently, 0.5 mg free chlorine water is intended for immediate use -it should not be kept or exposed to sources of contamination. It is worth noting that chlorine has a great affi nity for metals; as a result, water should not be chlorinated or stored in metal containers because chlorine oxidizes metal, and the metal lining of containers can absorb the purifi cation chlorine entirely (much more, in fact, than the amounts of chlorine usually used for water purifi cation)."
