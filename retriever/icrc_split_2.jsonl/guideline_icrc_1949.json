"that has been previously boiled for 10 minutes at least. This process produces high-energy milk that supplies approximately 100 kcal (418 kJ) and 4 g of protein for 100 ml. Its P/E ratio is thus 16% -this is quite high for kwashiorkor cases with medical complications and for very severe marasmus cases, but nevertheless permits most patients to be saved. In such circumstances, vitamin and mineral supplements are likely to be unavailable also; consequently, a catch-up rate of 10 g/kg/day is reasonable. Technically speaking, this option requires that the amounts necessary to prepare for example 25 or 50 milk rations of a given volume be well calibrated from the outset; this calibration then facilitates TFC supply planning."
