"Tables are available for this. Thus, where t = 2.179 and the degree of freedom = 12, the probability of error is 5%, when the two populations are different. If the degree of freedom is 21 and t = 3.819, the probability of error is 1/1,000. # The p Value\nEpidemiological studies refer to the p value, which is ''the probability of obtaining, by pure chance, a difference greater than or equal to the one observed.'' 43 The norm is not to accept p values higher than 0.05 (5% risk of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true). Most authors prefer p values under 0.01 (1% margin of error). # Correlation Coefficient\nTwo variables may be positively associated (both evolving in the same direction) or negatively associated (developing in inverse ratio). This association is measured by the correlation coefficient, 44 which may vary between +1 (perfect positive correlation) and -1 (perfect negative correlation). The statistical significance of a correlation coefficient can be determined as follows: ''The correlation coefficient is multiplied by the square root of the number of pairs and, if the product is greater than 2, the correlation coefficient can be considered significant at the 5% threshold.'' 45 \n\n# Analysis of the Variance\nThe test of the F variance compares the results of several sets of data by examining the relation of the variability between the sets of measures and the variability within each of these sets. There are tables (Fisher & Yates) for calculating the value of F for various degrees of freedom. . 44 The formula for calculating the coefficient of correlation is:\nr = S (X -Xm) (Y -Ym)\nH S (X -Xm) 2 S (Y -Ym) 2 45 A.
