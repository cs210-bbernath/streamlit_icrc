It should be remembered that: . usually, a proportion is sought;\nthe choice of method depends on the distribution of the population: -displaced-person and refugee camps are best suited to simple random sampling or systematic sampling; -people dispersed in little groups over large areas are better suited to cluster sampling. In this case, the problem will be to obtain an estimate of the number of people by place of residence, a preliminary condition for calculating the cumulative populations and the sampling interval. The EPIINFO computer program can be used to obtain the sample size automatically:\n1."
