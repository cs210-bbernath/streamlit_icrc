"housing, and sources of energy are all taken for granted. In developing countries, however, all this is much more difficult: water is several kilometers away and of poor quality; housing is flimsy, the environment is infested with communicabledisease vectors, the supply of energy is unreliable. In disaster situations, whatever their cause, mastering the environment becomes more than ever an essential task of the health-care system. Like access to food, access to water is a matter of life and death for populations who have been displaced or cut off from their usual resources. Waste disposal and vector control help considerably to prevent, or at least to reduce, the incidence of communicable diseases."
