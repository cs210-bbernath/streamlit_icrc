"In most emergency situations, this idea is unrealistic, both logistically and in terms of people's ability to use two networks simultaneously. 5 Thus, ''water needs'' means an individual's overall needs. It is tempting to define quantitative norms applicable at all times and in all places, but the reality is completely different: in determining water needs we must take into account physiological, cultural, geographic, and technical factors. Physiological norms alone indicate that the minimal quantity of water to permit survival would be about 3 liters per person per day in temperate zones, and 6-10 liters in hot climates. Yet water has other uses as well. The use of water for hygienic purposes is particularly important in reducing the incidence of communicable diseases. The general view is that 10-15 liters of water should be supplied per person per day, but this quantity varies considerably from one culture to the next. When determining the quantities of water that should be provided for hygiene, planners must keep in mind that in many cultures water is more of a ritual element than a factor in hygiene. Climate and geological conditions affect the quantities of water that can be provided."
