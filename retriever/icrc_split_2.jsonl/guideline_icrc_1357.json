"Evaluation serves to determine whether operational objectives have been achieved. If evaluation only takes place at the end of the operation, it can merely draw lessons from the past. This is only useful if the agency has the means to integrate fi ndings into future action. Evaluation is more relevant if it is continuous or regular (like monitoring), in order to adjust current programmes in a timely fashion. This means that, like monitoring, programme appraisal must be planned ahead, with pre-defi ned indicators, and must rest upon a plan that includes regular balance studies, or that are timed according to critical stages."
