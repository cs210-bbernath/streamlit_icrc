"Population Displacements The protection of refugee populations poses specific problems. The fact that civilians are obliged to seek refuge elsewhere, within their own or in a foreign country, is the direct consequence of a violation of international humanitarian law, which has failed to protect them in their home environment: ''Violation of humanitarian law, actual or feared, is the cause of most movements of displaced persons or refugees in situations of armed conflict.'' 32 The term ''refugee'' refers to a person who has sought refuge in another country, i.e. who has crossed an international border. An internally displaced person is still within the borders of his or her country."
