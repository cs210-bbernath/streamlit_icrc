"The magnitude of such gaps is proportional to the existing harm, and to the vulnerability to a further deterioration of the situation; it refl ects the severity of the crisis. # The securing of food\nProblems arise from a reduction in production activities and/or in production options, an absolute or relative drop in yield, and restricted options for exchange. # The gap between means and needs\nThe gap between means and needs is not always obvious, unless the famine stage has been reached, marked by a clear deterioration of the nutritional status of the population (this case provides an indirect, but reliable, indication that the gap is signifi cant and has existed for some time). Otherwise, a balance study must compare the unavoidable expenses, the resources produced, and their yield 6 which is meant to cover these unavoidable expenses. The proportion of overall available resources allocated to food must also be investigated, bearing in mind that the closer this proportion lies to 80%, the more critical the situation becomes if the proportion is normally lower. Qualitatively, the gap between available resources and needs to be met is measured by comparing what is available at the time of the assessment with what would normally be used. For example, gathering activities may normally provide high food-value nuts and fi sh, whereas at the time of assessment, they only secure leaves and wild grass seeds whose energy content is low. Normally, activities that supplement production may be the brewing of beer (which provides good cash yield); at the time of assessment, they may rest solely on the sale of fi rewood that is found far from the home and sold at low prices owing to the saturation of this sector. Quantitatively, the gap may be appraised through the remaining food reserves and the state of the current or anticipated food production, and the estimation of their adequacy to cover the needs, and by studying the relative market value of available resources and basic goods and services."
