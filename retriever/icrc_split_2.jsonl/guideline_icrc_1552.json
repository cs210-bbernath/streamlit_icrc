"as to its feasibility, then objectives have been set poorly. In such cases, the entire planning process must be revisited. \n# PLANNING ACTIVITIES AND RESOURCES\nPlanning consists in defi ning what activities must be implemented, their precise combinations, in order to achieve specifi c objectives; it also sets their timing. This effort amounts to operational tactics, which must not be confused with the overall strategy. The strategy sets the combination and coordination of the different operational measures in order to achieve an overall objective; the tactics on the other hand are subjected to the strategy and permit the practical implementation of the necessary measures, as dictated by the need for assistance and the context-specifi c constraints and opportunities."
