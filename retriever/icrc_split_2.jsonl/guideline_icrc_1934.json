"Governments should facilitate the timely fl ow of relief goods and information during disasters: relief supplies and equipment are brought into a country solely for the purpose of alleviating human suffering, not for commercial benefi t or gain. Such supplies should normally be allowed free and unrestricted passage and should not be subject to requirements for consular certifi cates of origin or invoices, import and/or export licences or other restrictions, or to importation taxation, landing fees or port charges. The temporary importation of necessary relief equipment, including vehicles, light aircraft and telecommunications equipment, should be facilitated by the receiving host government through the temporary waiving of licence or registration restrictions. Equally, governments should not restrict the re-exportation of relief equipment at the end of a relief operation. To facilitate disaster communications, host governments are encouraged to designate certain radio frequencies, which relief organizations may use in-country and for international communications for the purpose of disaster communications, and to make such frequencies known to the disaster response community prior to the disaster. They should authorize relief personnel to utilize all means of communication required for their relief operations."
