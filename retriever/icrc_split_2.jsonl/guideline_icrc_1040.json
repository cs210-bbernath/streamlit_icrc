"Harmonizing Development Policies\n\n# Development Policies at the National Level\nDevelopment policies that are centered mainly on the economic sector are no longer sacrosanct, and provision for social needs is becoming a priority: ''The 1980s: Economic restructuring is considered the premise of development. The 1990s: Reforming social policies has become an imperative.'' 55 Although the importance of the social sector is now realized, the task of actually doing something about it is hindered by both lack of economic means and an increase in social needs. This is true not only in the developing countries, but also in the developed countries where the era of the welfare state is coming to an end."
