"The best way of adapting intake is to adjust it to appetite, in the absence of sickness. It is unrealistic to claim to satisfy recommended intakes, and to expect a given population to understand what this means. It is diffi cult for laymen to apply recommended intakes in practice. On the other hand, children who are breastfed and weaned with traditional foods as described above regulate their diet according to their actual requirements -they stop when they are satiated, and protest if they are still hungry, providing an unambiguous indicator. Provided that the above principles are observed, and that the child is growing, is active during waking hours, sleeps well and is generally healthy, there is no cause for dietary concerns. # The themes of nutritional information 5.3 Diets\nThis discussion is limited to the basic principles that should guide feeding, and which moreover apply in all circumstances; these should be applied by humanitarian agencies as much as possible. These principles can provide the material for nutritional information; they consist in observing recommended intakes and ensuring nutrient balance and food group balance. The following recommendations should be applied durably in order to avoid ultimately harmful consequences on health. Imbalance or excess, or temporary and exceptional shortage, usually has no signifi cant impact. # Nutrient balance\nThe balance between different nutrients is determined mainly by recommended intakes. However, energy may equally be supplied in the form of lipids or glucides (simple or complex, see below) as in the form of protein. In order to limit statistical health risks, 14 the necessary balance between macronutrients in order to satisfy energy requirements are summarized below. # The contribution of lipids to the overall energy intake\nLipids should account for 15 to 30% of the overall energy intake (WHO, 2003). # The contribution of saturated and unsaturated lipid to the overall energy intake\nThe proportion of lipids within the overall energy supply (i.e. 30%) should combine 20% unsaturated lipids -of which 2.5% essential lipids -and no more than 10% saturated lipids (WHO, 2003;European Commission, 1993). # The contribution of protein to the overall energy intake\nThe energy value of protein is 4 kcal (16.7 kJ)/g. Protein should account for 12 to 13% of the overall energy intake (WHO, 1988b). In actual fact, protein should account for at least 10% and at most 15% of the overall energy intake (WHO, 2003); this 10-15% bracket is not an objective: it provides a tolerance range. # The contribution of simple glucides to the overall energy intake\nSimple glucides are products that are used to sweeten foodstuffs, such as cane or beetroot sugar, as opposed to complex glucides, mainly the starch chains (long glucose molecule chains) that form most of the tubers, and cereal and legume seeds. Simple glucides should account for no more than 10% of the overall energy intake (WHO, 1988b). # The contribution of complex glucides to the overall energy intake\nSubtracting the lipid and protein contribution from the overall energy intake indicates that complex glucides should account for between 55 and 75% of the overall energy intake. This recommendation does not allow for the possible intake of alcohol and simple glucides, whose harmful effects on health require no further demonstration."
