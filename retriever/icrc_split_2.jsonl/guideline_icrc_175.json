"Day-care NRCs operate for a limited period of the day. However, since beneficiaries must be given at least four meals a day for effective nutritional rehabilitation, such centers should operate for 8-12 hours a day. # Medical Services in the Centers\nMedical personnel are necessary in all NRCs, although their importance depends on the type of NRP implemented in the center. For category I NRPs, medical services are limited to ambulatory care for the most common medical problems, though provision should be made for referring cases that are beyond the center's medical capacity -either to the closest local hospital or a residential NRC. For category II NRPs, a greater medical presence is required, owing to the seriousness of the medical problems so often associated with acute malnutrition. Care must be taken, however, not to fall into the trap of pediatric hospitalization, in which the feeding aspect becomes secondary to the purely medical aspect."
