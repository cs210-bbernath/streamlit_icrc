Ultimately, the decision to close therapeutic feeding programmes is based upon the risk factors that can be anticipated, such as seasonal variations, probable population movements, and other phenomena that could upset the feeding process. The closure of therapeutic feeding programmes depends on the monitoring of:\n9 the dynamics and characteristics of severe malnutrition as observed within the feeding centre and in the target population; 9 the living conditions of the target population; 9 the impact of the overall operational strategy; 9 the probability that malnutrition will increase again.
