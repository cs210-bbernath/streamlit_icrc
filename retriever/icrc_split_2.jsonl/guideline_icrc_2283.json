Admission thresholds -based on the different indicators -are as follows:\n9 mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC):  12.5 cm; 9 MUAC-for-height expressed as a percentage of the median:  75%; 9 MUAC-for-height expressed in Z-scores:  -3 Z-scores; 9 weight-for-height expressed as a percentage of the median:  70%; 9 weight-for-height expressed in Z-scores:  -3 Z-scores.
