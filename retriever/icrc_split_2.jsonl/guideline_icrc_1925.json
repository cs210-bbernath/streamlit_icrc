"improvement is weak, or if the patient develops an infection. First-line treatment should show results within two days; if it does not, chloramphenicol should be added to fi rst-line treatment (25 mg/kg every 8 hours -every 6 hours if meningitis is suspectedfor 5 days) (WHO, 1999). By then, the patient should show appetite and begin to gain weight. If not, second-line treatment must be started and fi rst-line treatment must be extended to a total of 10 days; if no progress is noted by then, other complications such as AIDS and/or tuberculosis must be investigated. If patients are not all systematically treated upon admission, then treatment is reserved for kwashiorkor cases and complicated marasmus cases, in line with the above recommendations regarding septic shock."
