"To this end, assessment must follow a plan, and not seek information blindly. The data required for this plan must be identifi ed, and its use defi ned, as must the complementary measures that will provide an adequate understanding of the problem and facilitate the defi nition of needs. The diffi culty may lie in distinguishing what is essential from what is not, both in terms of the scope of investigation without direct connection with the identifi cation of problems and needs for assistance, and the precision and detail that translates into waste of time, without really improving the resulting data. For example, if access to food is suspected to be insuffi cient, should this be verifi ed through the measure of the nutritional status of a sample of children under 6 years, through interviews with key informants, or through the direct observation of what people are eating? Each method has its advantages and its drawbacks, and the ultimate choice is determined by the specifi city of the situation itself -and this may require all three. If simple random sampling is used on the assumption that prevalence rates have reached 45% of severe malnutrition, is the preferred confi dence interval \u00b12% or \u00b16%, knowing that in the fi rst case, 2,000 children must be measured, and in the second only 200? For practical purposes, the second option is usually acceptable."
