"sample (n) and interval sizes (a) are then defi ned. If the area of the fi eld is one hectare (100 x 100 m), and the maize grows in rows at 75 cm intervals, and the distance between rows is also 75 cm, then the fi eld includes 133 rows, each of 133 plants, i.e. 133 x 133 plants = 17,733 plants in total (N). If the sample size is 350 plants (n), then the interval size (a) is 17,733 / 350 = 50.7. For practical purposes, the interval size in this example is rounded down to 50; this also increases the sample size somewhat and, thus, accuracy."
