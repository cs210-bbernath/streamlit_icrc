"# Macro-nutrient requirements\n\n# Qualitative aspects\nFood rations must supply enough energy and protein, and energy requirements take precedence over all others. Rations must satisfy these requirements fi rst, or severe malnutrition may develop rapidly. The staples that contribute to the ration are therefore usually the following:\n9 a main source of energy, usually cereals which also supplies a substantial amount of protein and micro-nutrients; 9 a concentrated source of protein, usually legumes, which provides both energy and micro-nutrients; 9 a concentrated source of energy in the form of vegetable oil or fat. These three types of foods must be balanced, with an acceptable variation in the order of \u00b15% that is usually determined by logistical constraints at distribution level. # The lipid energy/overall energy ratio\nAccording to different recommended intakes, the contribution of lipids should represent 10 to 20% of the overall calorie supply; only de Ville de Goyet recommends 20-40% (de Ville de Goyet, 1978). Oil is included in food rations because it is a concentrated source of energy and is essential in some cooking methods; it also enhances fl avour."
