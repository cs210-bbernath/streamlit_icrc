"A purely curative approach leads to a vicious circle which is difficult to break. If priority is given to the problem of lack of food, by facilitating access to food resources or directly providing victims with the food that they need, not only will the prevalence of malnutrition decrease, but also that of the medical problems that are generally closely linked to it. Similarly, supplying the victims with sufficient quantities of clean water will contribute to a notable improvement in the health status of the entire population, mainly by reducing the prevalence of diarrheal diseases. # Vicious Cycle of Curative Medicine\n\n# Role of Feeding Interventions in an Emergency\n\n# Feeding & Nutrition\nThe provision of food will help save lives, maintain health, and reduce the number of medical problems Other measures are also important in reducing mortality -for example, immunization against measles and the promotion of oral rehydration. # Role of Environmental Hygiene Interventions in an Emergency\n\n# Feeding & Nutrition\n\n# Environmental Hygiene\nEnvironmental hygiene measures will help preserve health and reduce the number of sick, particularly those with communicable diseases\nThe purpose of all these programs is to promote and preserve health. They should be the basis of any health-care system on which curative-oriented services will depend; from the very beginning of an action, a multisectoral approach to health problems should be envisioned."
