"# Hygiene\nThe population of a TFC constantly changes. As a result, newcomers and their personal belongings must be treated against external parasites upon admission. Thereafter, bedding and clothing must be regularly disinfected, and TFC residents must wash and keep up the best possible personal hygiene. Taking part in sanitation information sessions and maintenance and cleaning chores are key aspects of raising awareness of issues related to hygiene. # TFC condition\nThe sheer magnitude of the task at hand can easily eclipse some supervision aspects. Here again however, unrelenting thoroughness is essential: the cleanliness of facilities and latrines, the condition of water supply and disposal systems, the infrastructural condition, and the general appearance of the TFC, all contribute to making the centre more welcoming. Repairs and replacements must be done without delay."
