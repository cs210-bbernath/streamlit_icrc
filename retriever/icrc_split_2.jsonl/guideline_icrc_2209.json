"possible supply of micro-nutrients, and the commonest are discussed below. \n# Supplying foods to complete staple foods\nThis is no doubt the best way by far of providing all essential nutrients, because complements enhance fl avour and dietary variety. Its major drawback relates to the fact that such complements are fresh foods (such as vegetables, fruits, and animal products), which spoil quickly. This implies that they must be found locally or suffi ciently close to ensure that they are still fresh enough at the time of distribution. Furthermore, they must be distributed suffi ciently frequently and in adequate amounts (at least 150 g of fruits and vegetables per person per day, that is, 4.5 kg per person per month) to ensure appropriate intakes, because some micro-nutrients are not stored in the organism."
