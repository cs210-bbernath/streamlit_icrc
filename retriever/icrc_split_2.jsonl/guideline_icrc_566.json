"Plan for Incoming Casualties The contingency plan has several aspects. \n# Preparing the Facility\nThe hospital must be organized to receive an influx of casualties. The section designated for that purpose must be made operational immediately. The roads giving access to the hospital should be cleared to allow ambulances to pass. \n# Preparing the Personnel\nThe staff's duties in a situation of incoming casualties must be clearly defined in advance, so that no time is lost when the moment comes. The chief surgeon's job is to revise the operating schedule and to free beds occupied by patients who can be moved to other wards or facilities; the head nurse is usually responsible for supervising the preparation of equipment such as blood units, drugs, surgical supplies, etc."
