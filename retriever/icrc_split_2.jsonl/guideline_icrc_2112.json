"Sessions should be scheduled in such a way as to disrupt essential community activities as little as possible; a weekly frequency is usually adequate. The location chosen for sessions should be welcoming, and be sheltered from the elements. The audience should be limited to 20 or so participants in order to give each the time to express views, observe, and experiment, and for trainers to devote adequate time to each individual. Theoretical components should be kept short (10 minutes at most), the remaining time (one hour at most) being devoted to discussion, demonstrations, and experimentation. Active participation should be encouraged as much as possible by presenting the exercise as an exchange rather than a one-way lecture."
