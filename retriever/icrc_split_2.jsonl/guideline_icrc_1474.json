"considered as the prime method to decide upon humanitarian action. This is a conceptual aberration, because data in itself does not explain the lead-up to the situation nor its evolution in any way. As discussed in Chapter VI, measuring nutritional status provides a single indicator of the entire feeding process and its overall functioning. This indicator however only permits late action, particularly if it provides the main criterion for assistance. As a result, it does not meet the objectives of humanitarian action, which for example cannot be delayed until 30% of a given population has lost 20% of its weight."
