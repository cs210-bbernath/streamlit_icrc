"has been the basis of most programs of malaria control. This method has not eradicated malaria as was anticipated when it was introduced in the 1950s, but when properly applied it helps reduce malaria transmission significantly. The feasibility of control depends on:\n-previous knowledge of the type and characteristics of the vector, as well as its degree of resistance to insecticides; -a reasonably stable population; -the possibility of finding the necessary material means. There are other ways of controlling adult vectors (chemical sterilization, genetic engineering), but they cannot be applied in emergency situations. \n# Controlling Transmission from Vector to Man\nTransmission from vector to man is controlled by means of simple measures designed to reduce the possibility of contact between the two."
