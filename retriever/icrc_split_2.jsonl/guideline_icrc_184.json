"populations, in contrast, produce a heavy ''demand'' for nutritional care. In this case, the establishment of facilities designed expressly to meet that demand must be considered. -The potential of existing local facilities The degree to which local facilities can meet demand varies from one situation to the next. It should be noted that in most developing countries, the relevant health services, particularly pediatric services, are already overburdened. A massive influx of patients suffering from severe malnutrition and requiring 24hour care exacerbates an already precarious situation. When the number of beneficiaries exceeds the capacity of the local facilities, the construction of autonomous NRCs must be contemplated."
