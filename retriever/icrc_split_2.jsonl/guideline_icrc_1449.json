"In this example, the sample size is reduced by 11%. Had the total population been 1,000 subjects, the corrected sample size would be 197 subjects, that is, a 20% reduction in sample size. Sample size for systematic random sampling, and for each unit in stratifi ed sampling, is calculated in the same way as for simple random sampling. \n# General aspects of assessment methods\n3.4 Selecting subjects Cluster random sampling Sample size is calculated in the same way as simple random sampling, but the greater uncertainty, and the inevitable heterogeneity associated with clusters must be allowed for. The formula is therefore completed with a \"c\" cluster factor, which increases sample size in order to preserve the degree of accuracy."
