"hence, the energy supply) is accounted for by maize, mainly. It spread in Europe with the introduction of maize, which frequently superseded traditional and secondary cereals because its yield is higher and the plant is better protected against pests (particularly birds). Unfortunately, the nutritional value of maize is lower than that of other cereals, particularly because its protein is of inferior quality (poor in tryptophan), and because its niacin content is mainly in a form that is biologically unusable. As a result, serious pellagra risks arise in settings where maize provides the only staple, as is the case today in many rural areas, in crises, and in prisons."
