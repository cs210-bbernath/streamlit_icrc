"rendundant, and if a GFD cannot be set up rapidly. \n# NUTRITION MANUAL\nChapter XIV -Supplementary 2. Implementing supplementary 2.1 Intervention modes according feeding programmes feeding programmes to SFP objectives\n\n# Criteria for admission: moderate malnutrition\nModerately malnourished children under 5 years of age are priority candidates. If their age is unknown, the criterion can be set as a height inferior to 110 cms. Moderate malnutrition can be assessed through mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), MUAC-for-height, or weight-for-height. As noted by Briend, mid-upper arm circumference provides a better indicator of mortality risk than weight-for-height (Briend, 1995). 14 Mid-upper arm circumference can be used alone to select benefi ciaries; it is faster but less accurate than MUAC-for-height."
