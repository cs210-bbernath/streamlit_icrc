"During distribution proper, the lighter foodstuffs or items (such as soap) must be handed over fi rst. # Card verifi cation\nCards must be verifi ed at each distribution round in order to limit both claims and attempts at abuse. The verifi cation process takes place at the queue, before recipients proceed to the different attention points. Verifi cation includes the checking of distribution location codes, and those indicating the group due to receive assistance on that specifi c date. Cards that do not indicate the correct distribution location are withheld, their holders' identity is verifi ed, and the reasons for this situation are examined. Card numbers are also verifi ed in order to check them against those reported as stolen or lost. Card verifi cation may be recorded in ledgers. # Notifi cation to offi cials\nLocal authorities must be informed of the distribution due to take place, as they must also ensure that third parties are prevented from taking over."
