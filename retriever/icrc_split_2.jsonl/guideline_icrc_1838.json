"The main objective of nutritional information is then to improve the health of target groups by reducing the prevalence, incidence, and seriousness of such disorders. In developing countries, they affect mainly small children, the elderly and persons who depend on institutions, especially when this involves internment in some form. In small children, malnutrition and sickness often combine, and it is diffi cult to distinguish the respective contributions of feeding practices, poor hygiene, inadequate access to preventive and curative healthcare, and the virulence of communicable disease. The elderly face nutritional disorder because of their physical and mental health, poverty, isolation, or abandon; when they are cared for by relatives, nutritional disorders usually result from health problems. The nutritional disorder of institutional inmates usually results from neglect on the part of the institution. For example, nutritional, health, and hygiene problems are commonplace in prisons, and even more so in psychiatric asylums and orphanages, where living conditions can be worse. In the industrialized West, poor feeding practices can be found in practically all social strata owing to excess and imbalance. Interestingly, health disorders related to nutrition (such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and cardio-vascular disease) regress substantially in times of crisis; for such groups, crisis may in fact be qualifi ed as benefi cial in dietary terms. # THE OBJECTIVE AND PREMISE OF NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION\nWithin the framework of humanitarian action, nutritional information aims at replacing poor practices with others that are more appropriate."
