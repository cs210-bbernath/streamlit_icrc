"Initially, kitchen tasks require some practice and consequent adjustments to the time allotted to each activity, in order to arrive at a realistic schedule. Kitchens must be organized in such a way as to minimize confusion in the preparation of meals according to the phases of nutritional treatment. To this end, it is best to distinguish clearly between the preparation of F-75 Formula for initial treatment (which requires intensive and special attention), and the preparation of other meals. TFC kitchens require constant attention. The preparation, distribution and consumption of food are most time-consuming; as such, they should be organized to perfection and be supervised constantly in order to ensure their quality and regularity. # Food distribution\nThe benefi ciaries, their carers, and the staff must all know and observe mealtime schedules. During initial treatment, assistants can deliver the food directly to the patients in the intensive care unit, especially if the latter operates 24 hours per day. Otherwise, the benefi ciaries and carers collect the food."
