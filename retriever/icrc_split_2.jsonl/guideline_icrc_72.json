"method used to define priorities or to determine relative importance. For example, several informants may be asked to indicate their problems or needs in order of priority, and the assessment team can then verify the consistency of the answers. Alternatively, economic status categories can be defined and described in terms of means and occupation, whilst differences between poor, average and well-off households can be established. Proportional piling may then be used to attribute population percentages to each wealth group. Pair-wise ranking is also a very useful method to define preferences or order of importance. For instance, to determine the importance of food sources (i.e. the issue), informants are asked to indicate the different sources they rely on."
