"# Data\nData collected during assessment is quantitative or qualitative -this is not to be confused with qualitative and quantitative variables. Quantitative data is expressed in numbers (e.g. prevalence rates). Qualitative data is collected in a manner that produces information that can only be expressed in words: why the local population believes that a well should not be dug in this specifi c location, explaining the panic following an increase in market prices, quoting a key informant, etc. Quantitative data can be produced from both qualitative and quantitative variables. Qualitative data may also be converted into quantitative data, for example, by indicating what proportion of the group shows a given behaviour, or expresses a given opinion. Variables can be \"dependent\" or \"independent\". Independent variables can be chosen, but cannot be infl uenced; they in fact infl uence the dependent variables that are the object of the assessment. Dependent variables therefore change according to the independent variable, and their dependency relates to the object under scrutiny. They are measured and collected as data. For example, atmospheric pollution levels affect morbidity rates; different pollution levels can be chosen (the independent variable) in order to examine their effect on morbidity rates (the dependent variable). # Variables\nSimilarly, the appraisal of corpulence resorts to weight-for-height. In this example, weight is the dependent variable (it is determined directly by food intake and health status); it is compared to height, which is independent of corpulence. On the other hand, the height-for-age index is used to appraise statural growth, and height becomes the dependent variable (it is determined by food intake and health status), whereas age is the independent variable in this case. # Indicators\nVariables are meaningless on their own; they must be converted into indicators, for example by combining them in indexes and, above all, by providing them with a meaning with respect to a more complex variable, or a vulnerability or risk factor. For instance, an anthropometric variable (such as weight) is converted into an anthropometric index by referring it to the reference value for the subject's height. This weight-for-height index is then converted into an indicator of nutritional status, by applying thresholds that permit the defi nition of malnutrition. # Interpreting indicators\nThe use of indicators assumes that they have meaning."
