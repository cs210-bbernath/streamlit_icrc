"literature provides many clues, and the answer is clearly negative. The cut-off point corresponding to the same risk of mortality varies according to circumstances. In some cases, and according to indexes, the risk curve is quite regular, without discontinuities; in such cases, shifting cut-off points always results in an excessive number of false positives or false negatives, thus posing a serious operational problem. This is not surprising in view of the many possible causes of pathological malnutrition. Anthropometry therefore remains a sound indicator of nutritional reserves or past growth patterns, but only provides an estimate of nutritional status. \n# The choice of index\nAnthropometry nevertheless remains essential in many circumstances."
