"Is there progress towards self-sufficiency? # Earthquakes\n\n# Interaction of Phenomenon and Vulnerability\nMany studies have shown that in an earthquake, it is the most disadvantaged populations who suffer the greatest loss of life. The explanation can be found in an analysis of vulnerability, particularly its social aspects:\n. housing, where construction does not accord with earthquake standards; 50\n. health-care facilities themselves fall prey to destruction in an earthquake;\n. health-care facilities are ill-prepared to receive large numbers of casualties;\n. restricted access to health-care facilities. # Measures to Reduce Vulnerability\nMeasures to reduce vulnerability are also generally designed to reduce underdevelopment. They include the implementation of standards, particularly construction standards."
