"it is not possible or desirable to target more precisely. This minimization involves the scrutiny of prevalence rates in several sites, rather than the entire area, hence the choice of clusters. Usually then, it is best to select many clusters containing fewer subjects each. n = 1. Another approach consists in deciding arbitrarily to select 30 clusters of 30 subjects each. This practice is common in humanitarian assessment, and avoids tedious calculation and sampling error, and provides good results. For a 5% sampling error, the expected accuracy in relation to different expected prevalence rates is the following: Once the assessment has been completed, accuracy must be corrected by applying a formula that allows for the cluster effect."
