"Ata, A Joint Report of WHO and UNICEF (1978), p. 79. Declaration made at the conclusion of the international conference held in Alma-Ata (USSR) on 12 September 1978, which marked a turning point in health service organization with regard to achieving a more equitable distribution of care. This conference gave rise to the WHO slogan ''health for all by the year 2000.'' The decision to orient a health-care system towards PHC obviously represents a political stand on the part of the government.
