"feasibility of chemoprophylaxis for the two risk groups mentioned above. \n# Controlling Malaria in the Clinical Stage\nThe purpose of treating the clinical forms of malaria is to reduce morbidity and especially mortality (caused by P. falciparum). The problem is not deciding whether or not to treat -that is imperative in every situation -but rather deciding which treatment to employ, taking into account drug resistances. The information collected on the spot from the appropriate authorities usually indicates which therapeutic regimens are likely to be efficacious. Drug resistances are not uniformly distributed, however, and the right treatment for one area is not necessarily the right one for the area next to it."
