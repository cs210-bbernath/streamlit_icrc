"-AIDS has increased the prevalence and incidence of tuberculosis -giving rise, in fact, to a veritable epidemic of TB, which will expand dramatically in the years to come. 105\n\n# Meningococcal Meningitis\n\n# Impact of the Problem\nThe average incidence of meningococcal meningitis in endemic regions is estimated at 10/100,000. During epidemic years, this incidence may increase to 500/100,000 in disadvantaged urban areas (camps can be considered to fall into this category). Meningococcal meningitis is known to develop mostly in communal settings (cities, schools, etc.). The logical conclusion, then, is that displaced-person camps are favorable breeding grounds for meningococcal epidemics. The group most at risk to develop the disease is people between the ages of 1 and 25."
