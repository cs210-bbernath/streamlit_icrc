"Examine the ''tools'' most often used in emergency situations. 5. Identify the priorities in coping with communicable diseases. 6. Survey the means used to control the most common communicable diseases in emergency situations. # I. General Overview\nDisaster situations are often associated with the idea of communicable diseases; the media cannot speak of an earthquake without mentioning the risk of an epidemic or showing pictures of medical teams immunizing the victims. To put the issue into a proper perspective, it may be helpful to list the main communicable diseases and to examine the factors that make them potentially dangerous in a disaster. # The Main Communicable Diseases\nTropical-medicine textbooks tend to classify communicable diseases according to the pathogenic agents that cause them (virus, bacterium, or parasite). In emergency situations, however, these diseases are customarily classified according to the way they are transmitted -which may, in some cases, be complex, involving several different mechanisms. Experience has shown that in emergencies, certain communicable diseases have a particularly great impact, as witness the mortality rates recorded among refugees in Thailand, Somalia, Sudan, and Malawi, where 50-95% of deaths were attributed to measles, diarrheal diseases, and acute respiratory infections. 1 Other important communicable diseases include meningitis (refugees from Sudan and Thailand), cholera (refugees from Somalia, Sudan, Malawi, etc.), and typhus (displaced populations in Ethiopia). Sometimes a refugee population contributes to an increased risk for a particular communicable disease in an environment which was previously free from it. This was the case, for example, when Sudanese refugees arrived in northern Uganda, in an area where trypanosomiasis had been under control. To define the kinds of intervention that can prevent such epidemics, it is essential to be familiar with the mechanisms that give these diseases a particular impact in emergency situations. # Factors Influencing the Impact of Communicable Diseases in Emergencies\nThe epidemics that develop in disaster situations are essentially a function of the large concentrations of displaced people or refugees living together in camps where living conditions are particularly hazardous. Natural disasters that do not entail mass population movements do not increase the risk of epidemics."
