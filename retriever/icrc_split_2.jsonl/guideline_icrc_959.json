"satisfying the victims' immediate needs while still maintaining ethical principles. \n# Strategy and Violations of International Humanitarian Law\nConfronted with violations of international humanitarian law, humanitarian agencies have a choice of two strategies which, although apparently contradictory, are in fact complementary. One involves appealing to international public opinion, while the other employs discretion in bilateral negotiations with the responsible authorities. The strategy of denouncing violations of international humanitarian law is meant to alert governments and the international community in general to the difficulties humanitarian agencies face in the normal performance of their work. The danger of this strategy, as mentioned above, is that it can harden the attitudes of the authorities responsible for blocking access to the victims; this may affect other vulnerable groups who already benefit from the presence of humanitarian agencies."
