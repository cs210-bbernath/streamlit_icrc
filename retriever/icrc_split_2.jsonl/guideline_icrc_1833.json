"Therapeutic feeding programmes are run through therapeutic feeding centres (TFC). Such centres are organized so as to provide the indispensable services required to treat patients suffering from severe malnutrition. They must be located in the close vicinity of the benefi ciary population, and of some healthcare facility to which patients that require special medical attention may be referred. The chosen location must be protected from the general risks prevailing, and its available space must permit extensions if necessary. A centre's layout is determined by the anticipated number of patients, and by access. The number of patients that can be admitted varies according to the magnitude of the problem and the number of TFC that can be opened in a given region."
