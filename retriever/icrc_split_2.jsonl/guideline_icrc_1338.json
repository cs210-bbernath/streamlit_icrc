"The different forms of graphic illustration described below are all useful in presenting and analysing data. # Graphs\nGraphs are widely used in humanitarian action; they are useful mainly to represent distributions, the evolution of a given characteristic with respect to another parameter (malnutrition, the price of basic food commodities, etc.), and the relationship between two varying characteristics. They commonly comprise a horizontal axis (x-axis, or abscissa), which usually refl ects the independent variable, and a vertical axis (y-axis, or ordinate), which refl ects the dependent variable. Two-axis graphs may be represented in different ways; graphs may also be used to refl ect proportions, by subdividing a given area (pie charts, horizontal, vertical or aggregate column charts, etc.). Figure 10.15 provides an example related to the evolution of staple cereal prices over time."
