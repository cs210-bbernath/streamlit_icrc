"sections, and the causes may then be investigated more thoroughly. This advantage is however of secondary importance because it is not the objective of this sampling method to compare sections. The selection of subjects within clusters requires the preliminary determination of the number of subjects per cluster by dividing the size of the sample by the number of clusters (\"k\"). For each cluster in the sub-section, the observer then spins a bottle or pencil (as described above) in the centre of the area under consideration, and systematically selects all subjects in the direction thus indicated. If the required number of subjects is not produced by this method, the exercise may be repeated as necessary."
