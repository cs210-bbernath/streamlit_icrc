"18). The responsibility for organizing relief is clearly explained in the commentary on the Additional Protocols of 1977. 20 The authorities in charge have the primary role:\n''The whole of the provision is based on the principle that States are primarily responsible for organizing relief. Relief societies such as the Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations are called upon to play an auxiliary role by assisting the authorities in their task.'' 21 External assistance enters the picture if the authorities are unable to meet their obligations: ''Such external aid is complementary; it is only provided when the responsible authorities can no longer meet the basic necessities of the civilian population whose survival is in jeopardy.'' 22 It is important that health-care personnel understand this division of responsibility well. Thus, the decision to set up a surgical hospital to care for war-wounded should be based not merely on the presence of war-wounded, but on an analysis of the correlation between local surgical facilities and the care required by the wounded. Only if the local hospitals are unable to provide the necessary care can external intervention be contemplated. # Health-Care Personnel\nHealth-care personnel make an obvious contribution in favor of the victims of armed conflicts: care for the wounded and sick, prevention of disease, and improvement of living conditions are all areas in which they use their skills. However, their responsibilities go far beyond mere medical care."
