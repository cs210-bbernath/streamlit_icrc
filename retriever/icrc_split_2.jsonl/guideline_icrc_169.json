At the beginning of the 1980s, the tendency in supplementary feeding was to provide meals at centers constructed specially for that purpose. Various comparative studies on the subject, however, have led to a reconsideration of this method, since the integration of the supplementary energy and protein in the basic ration appears to be preferable to the traditional approach to supplementary feeding. 68 The creation of feeding centers also tends to disrupt family life by forcing mothers to go to the centers every day, leaving at home those of their children who are not classified as vulnerable."
