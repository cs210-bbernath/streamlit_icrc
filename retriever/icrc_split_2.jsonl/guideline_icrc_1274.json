"delivery to its destination: this avoids temptation, abuse and pressures. Authorities are frequently offended by what they view as a lack of confi dence; humanitarian agencies are well placed, however, to know that confi dence has its limits. The associated risk is twofold: with respect to the victims (who may not receive the assistance they need), and with respect to the opposition, which could resent what may be seen as an unacceptable surrender of principles. The latter would react rapidly in ways that may include attacks on humanitarian actors. Here again, the principles of neutrality and impartiality are fundamental, and must be explained, understood and accepted, fi rst and foremost in the fi eld."
