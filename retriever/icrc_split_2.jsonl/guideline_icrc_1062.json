"However, their requirements may not match the agency's means or its objectives. They must therefore be informed of the type of information that is sought, and be involved in the defi nition of the problems, needs for assistance, and operational priorities and objectives, while being made aware of limitations and possibilities. Victims frequently equate assessment with the promise of assistance. Assessment should therefore be based upon the fi rm intention to act upon observed needs, to secure the means to do so, or to ensure that another agency will respond. 2. The assessment of needs is complicated by the variety of societies whose living standards, expectations, and means of voicing them all differ, and this variety may lead to different responses. This problem may be resolved to some extent by examining the diffi culty of surviving, in the light of the pre-crisis living conditions that enabled the society under scrutiny to function according to its cultural standards. Economic development gives rise to needs that are shaped by cultural determinism, 17 some of which are just as constraining to the survival of society as those resulting from biological determinism. These are the needs that humanitarian action must sometimes satisfy, and explain possible differences in the response."
