"number of individuals in each cluster rather than the contrary. 34 In our example, 7 children (6.4 rounded off to 7) will be examined in each cluster, giving a final total of 210 children. 35 Let us take the example of measuring the prevalence of malnutrition in famine-stricken areas, with the following parameters:\n-confidence level = 95%; -estimated prevalence of <80% weight-for-height = 20%; -confidence limits = +5%. \nn = Z 2 (p) (1 -q) (DEFF)\n\n# N = Z 2 pq D 2\nA total of 400 children would have to be included in the study -either 30 clusters of 14 children or 50 clusters of 8 children."
