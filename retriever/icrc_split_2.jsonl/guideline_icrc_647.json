"To compare a given variable in two populations, a sample must be taken in each population and compared with each other, to see whether they are similar or different. However, since these values were obtained from samples, they present a certain risk of error. In fact, a situation may arise where the true values for the two populations are similar, but the values found in the two samples deviate from each other to such a point that they are considered to be different. This sort of error is termed an ''error of the first kind,'' or type I error. For example, if we compare a control population in which variable X is 15%, while the true value of the variable in the population studied is 14%, we can say that the results are similar. However, since the study is based on samples, 95% of the values of the variable detected in a sample of n size will fall between + 1.96 standard errors. If, for example, the standard error is 2.95%, means found for samples of a given size n will fall between 11% and 19%, corresponding to the limits of the 95% confidence interval (z = 1.96). In this case, the two populations will be deemed similar, as long as the difference between the values of the control population and those of the studied population remains within the confidence interval. However, if the value for the surveyed population exceeds these limits, the two populations must be considered different with respect to the variable under examination. Yet this difference cannot be accepted as certain, since, in the example above, there is still a 5% probability that the populations are similareven if the value of the population studied is outside the confidence interval, since this interval was defined with a confidence level of 95% (z = 1.96). The opposite situation involves two populations presenting different true means (for example, 8% and 17%). Due to sampling errors, the value obtained for the sample from the first population may be 12% (mean + z SE), while the value for the sample from the second population is 13% (mean -SE). The two values are dangerously close, to the point where they are equated with each other. In this case, the affirmation that the two populations are identical is an ''error of the second kind,'' or type II error. The risk of error can be reduced by increasing the value of z. Thus, if z = 2.58, the risk of the value falling outside the confidence interval would be 1%. In the preceding example, the limits of that interval would be 10% and 20% (+2.58 SE). This means that the value of the variable in the population studied must be more than 20% or less than 10% for the two populations to be declared different (with a 1% probability that the difference will be due to a sampling error). While the probability of type I errors is reduced by pushing back further and further the points at which the two populations are declared different, at the same time the probability of declaring different populations identical (type II error) increases. Traditionally, the tendency is to control type I errors. 37 In this case, the initial hypothesis will be that the two populations are identical (null hypothesis). The 37 ''In fact, for a predetermined sample size, when we reduce the probability of making a type I error, we simultaneously increase the probability of making a type II error. In order to make both error probabilities arbitrarily low we would have to increase the sample size. For this reason we must choose which type of error we want to reduce; the convention has been to always control the probability of making a type I error.'' Michael Orkin and Richard Drogin, Vital Statistics (TMH, 1977), p. 122. purpose of statistical tests is to calculate the difference between the values observed 38 for the two populations, and to estimate whether that difference is big enough to affirm that the populations are different (that is, to reject the null hypothesis). This must take account of the persistent risk of sampling errors; the error here would be rejecting the null hypothesis when it is in fact true. This risk is expressed as a probability, the p value. The difference between two populations is significant when the probability (p) of making a mistake is less than 5%, and highly significant when the probability is less than 1%. # Statistical Tests\nRelative Risk\nThe measurement of relative risk is not, strictly speaking, a statistical test, since it involves merely simple calculations. However, since relative risk is directly linked to the value of the variable estimated from samples taken in two populations, it undergoes the same variations, based on the confidence level and the confidence limits. This is why the expression of the relative risk inherent in sample values takes the form of a confidence interval."
