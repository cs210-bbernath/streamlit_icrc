"rates mainly as described in Section 3.4.1 under Qualitative variables. Subsequent investigation provides prevalence rates that usually differ somewhat from expected rates; likewise, actual sample size may differ from expectations. As a result, confi dence intervals probably differ slightly from those used to calculate sample size, and must be corrected for the appropriate expression of results. In simple, systematic and stratifi ed random sampling, the formula used to calculate accuracy is the following: accuracy = \u00b1 \u03b5 \u00d7  1/2\nWhere: \u03b5 = 1.96, the factor determining the sampling error at 5% p = the actual prevalence rate n = the actual sample size."
