"member must be specially assigned to water supply and management. In a TFC, drinking water (fi ltered, protected, covered, and treated with 0.5 mg of chlorine per litre) is used for the preparation of food, drinking, the preparation of rehydration solutions, medical care, and personal hygiene. The water used for cleaning the centre, kitchen utensils, and clothing should be chlorinated at 0.2%. The necessary quantity of water is determined by the number of patients: usual recommendations are 30 to 50 litres per patient per day. This amount allows for all the water requirements of the centre (consumption, care, and cleaning), and corresponds to the needs commonly observed in disasters in developing countries."
