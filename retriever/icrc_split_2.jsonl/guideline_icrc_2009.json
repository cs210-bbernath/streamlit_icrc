"thus complicating the issuing of recommendations as to weight gain. As an example, if a child weighing 10 kg upon admission must gain 2 kg in the centre, with a 700 kcal supplementary daily ration, it will gain approximately 14 g per kilogramme per day if the ration is used strictly for recovery (i.e. assuming it is receiving an adequate ration at home). At a recovery rate of 14 grammes per kilogramme per day, it will need approximately two weeks to gain 2 kg. Under these circumstances, the centre is achieving its objective perfectly -this is a situation found only when SFPs are combined with effi cient GFDs, and provide safety nets or relays for therapeutic feeding."
