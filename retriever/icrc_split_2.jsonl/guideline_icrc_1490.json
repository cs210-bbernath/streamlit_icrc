"the independent variable because standard deviation varies according to points. For example, 80% of the weight-for-height median in boys corresponds to -2.2 standard deviations for an 80 cm height, and to -2.3 standard deviations for a 130 cm height. In the example used earlier, an 80 cm boy weighs 8 kg, and the median of the reference weight for his height is 11 kg. The percentage is then as follows:\n\n# Reference population centiles\nCentile numbers refl ect a position within a total of 100. Centile 50 corresponds to the median of the reference population: precisely half of this population shows values that exceed the median, and the other half shows lower values."
