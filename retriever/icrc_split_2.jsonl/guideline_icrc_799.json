"# NO: Why not? # Inadequate technical means\nQuite often emergency situations demand specific equipment that is unavailable in many countries. 38 Whether such gaps should be filled with a tailored, limited external aid depends on the need (how urgent it is, whether there is an alternative), the cost, and the long-term repercussions. One solution is to supply the needed equipment for the duration of the emergency and then take it back. Such plans often fall foul of reluctant local authorities who, by means of red tape, prevent the reexport of the equipment to its country of origin. # Lack of technical skills\nPersonnel may be present, but not necessarily trained to cope with the technical problems generated by emergencies. The most common example is war surgery, which requires the use of specific procedures unfamiliar to civilian surgeons. International aid can offer local surgeons appropriate training during the period of the emergency."
