"9 An offi ce, a cloakroom, and a place to relax for the staff. 9 A pharmacy, which is in fact the medicine store-room. It must be locked, as must be all the cupboards that accommodate valuable or dangerous material and medicine; medicine stocks are managed in the same way as food stocks. The duty nurse is responsible for the pharmacy keys, and must check the use of material and medicine if the task has been delegated to somebody else."
