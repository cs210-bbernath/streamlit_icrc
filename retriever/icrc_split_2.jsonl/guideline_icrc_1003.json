"To achieve an objective, several organizations will often mobilize for different but complementary activities which are all directed towards the same goal. In this process, if one of the agencies does not fulfill its obligations, the entire operation will suffer. Coordination may be based on programs, geographical regions, or intervention phases. # Programs\nThe distribution of programs is itself a mode of technical coordination. Essentially, it is important to avoid two agencies setting up the same kind of program in the same regions, which would result in duplication with perverse effects (such as the victims' using services furnished by both organizations at the same time). Agencies' attempts to outbid each other translate into a tendency to more sophisticated services which are both inappropriate and costly. # Geographical Regions\nThe geographical distribution of programs depends mostly on the respective mandates of the different agencies."
