The application of international humanitarian law must come to terms with military necessity: ''The law of war can only be, in fact, a law of compromise between military necessity and humanitarian requirements.'' 13 This pragmatism, however, must not be interpreted as surrender to the armed forces present. The neutrality and impartiality of the humanitarian agencies allow them to negotiate with the authorities in charge of the military operations so that humanitarian requirements are respected to the extent necessary to protect the victims of the conflict. The creation of a humanitarian ''space'' in situations of armed conflict will gain wider acceptance if humanitarian organizations are indeed seen by the parties to the conflict to be neutral and impartial."
