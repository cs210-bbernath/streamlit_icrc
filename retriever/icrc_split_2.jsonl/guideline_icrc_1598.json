"The benefi ciaries cannot prepare their own meals because they lack the necessary space or material (such as cooking utensils and fuel). The provision of fuel is a major problem in GFD, and can cause widespread environmental damage because humanitarian agencies tend to neglect this fundamental aspect. Operating agencies must rather ensure that the use of fuel does not result in deforestation or the exhaustion of natural resources to the detriment of local populations, and does not give rise to tension."
