"profi t, humanitarian agencies are accused of fuelling the crisis. Should humanitarian assistance be questioned as a result? And what about humanitarian ethics? Clearly, in such circumstances, the victims have little choice, if any. They are penalized by their own authorities and the armed groups that violate their most basic rights. As such, they deserve to be protected via representation efforts and material assistance. Politicians, donors, and humanitarian agencies should therefore not penalize them further by depriving them of assistance under the pretext that the latter contributes to the crisis. It is rather a matter of attributing tasks, and how duties are complied with."
