"ReSoMal and feeding resumes, ReSoMal is alternated with F-75 Formula. There is no risk of excess mineral concentrations if ReSoMal is alternated with F-75 Formula, especially in the case of potassium; both solutions in fact share roughly the same mineral concentration, which corresponds to requirements. However, ReSoMal must never be combined with F-75 Formula in the same solution, as this would double the potassium concentration and this could be fatal. Patients for their part limit their intake to their ability to drink. \n# Differentiated diagnosis of dehydration and septic shock\nDehydration is easily confused (or associated) with septic shock. However, experience with severely malnourished subjects in famines shows that septic shock is much less common than dehydration."
