"infection is demonstrated by clinical signs and/or the patient's history. In circumstances where primary and secondary malnutrition combine, or where malnutrition is mainly secondary because of climatic variations or poor hygiene (that is, where malnutrition results rather from infection), it is best not to run unnecessary risks and resort instead to systematic treatment. The decision should ultimately be based on medical expertise and adapt to circumstances rather than follow strict guidelines. As for the treatment of septic shock, broad-spectrum antibiotics and fi rst-line treatment must be administered, allowing for second-line treatment in case of failure to respond to fi rst-line therapy."
