The ultimate decision must also allow for the constraints of the distributing agency in terms of staff and logistics, with respect to the number of recipients and the time required for the distribution itself. Take-away food rations may be distributed in the form of separate commodities, individual or family parcels, or survival rations and biscuits. Separate food commodities and parcels are preferred. If parcels are chosen, distribution frequency must be discussed in detail beforehand, as this determines their content -once they have been assembled, their content can no longer be changed."
