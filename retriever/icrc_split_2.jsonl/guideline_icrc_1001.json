"the length of time anticipated to achieve this outcome. The definition of objectives can serve as a basis for coordination between agencies. After all, if one agency defines an objective clearly in terms of the criteria listed above, other agencies will know what problems are being treated, for which group of victims, and for how long. This coordination of objectives, however, is not really satisfactory, since inasmuch as each agency remains in control of its own objectives, there is a risk of competition, of rivalry, even of conflict. Although planners might contemplate creating some mechanism of coordination to define the objectives of each organization, this would be difficult because:\n. if one agency agreed to exercise this responsibility, it would come into conflict with all the others' vague desires for independence;\n. the institution of a cooperative system including several agencies with an equal power of decision would hinder their ability to respond quickly enough to emergency situations;\n. delegating the responsibility to the authorities would challenge the principle of neutrality, which is indispensable in situations of armed conflict.
