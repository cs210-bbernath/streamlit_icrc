"This is true for growing children as well as for adults. Milk being a liquid (nearly 90% water) is a very dilute source of energy and a baby after the fi rst 4-6 months of life cannot satisfy his energy requirements from milk alone, but needs solids which are a more concentrated source of energy. It is necessary to eat several foods to obtain the variety of nutrients found in fresh milk. The usual \"food basket\" for general distribution in relief actions consists of:\n9 an appropriate staple food -usually a cereal 9 a rich source of protein -grain legumes 9 a rich source of energy -usually a vegetable oil Quantities should be suffi cient to provide an average of 2,000 calories and 50 g of protein per person per day. If the population is malnourished higher energy intakes will be required to rehabilitate it."
