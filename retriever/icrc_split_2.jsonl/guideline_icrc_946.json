"# Support or Replacement of Local Services? The victims of armed conflicts require services able to cover their essential needs: health-care services, systems to supply food and water, housing, and guarantees of security. Over the last decade, certain non-governmental organizations have tried to assume the responsibility themselves for the institution and provision of services for such victims. Is This Approach Justified? The primary responsibility for the care of a population falls on the local authorities. Only if they fail to meet it should the humanitarian agencies step in to remind them of their duties towards the victims and, if necessary, to take the practical measures required. The ICRC's position in this respect is clear:\n''The aspect of the ICRC's relief policy which is visible to the outside world is the provision of food or medicines to keep individuals or populations alive, alleviate their suffering and avoid their future being compromised by the effects of illness, injury or malnutrition. However, this is merely the most conspicuous feature of a much broader policy. First and foremost, the ICRC endeavours to ensure that the de jure or de facto authorities allow the population access to the essential resources and services needed for its survival and for the community to function properly and, where necessary, that they provide whatever assistance is required.'' 2\nHere, ethics are the basis for the criteria the humanitarian agencies will use in deciding to implement a replacement strategy. Such a strategy is unavoidable when there is no local facility to take care of the victims, and might involve, for example, building a hospital to treat war-wounded in a region with no hospitals at all. It is difficult to determine criteria when facilities exist but do not function in a satisfactory manner, or, worse, when the services furnished are below the standards that would be considered normal in a particular context. Humanitarian agencies give themselves the ''right'' to take over the facilities in question in order to improve their performance, reorganizing their management, investing in them, etc. In this case, the question of the facility's autonomy or dependence vis-a`-vis the authorities normally responsible arises. Without real control over the facility's operation, relief organizations cannot expect rapid change; the aid they provide will go to produce services which will always be below the norm. At the other end of the spectrum, however, a total appropriation of the facility amounts to a strategy of dependence. In short, humanitarian agencies must respect what already exists, but, at the same time, they must know how to take its place if necessary. Any attempt of this sort should, of course, be subject to careful reflection."
