"the case for children under the age of five years. Chemoprophylaxis is never total, and the subject continues to receive enough exposure to the parasite to develop immunity, even if the immunoglobulin and antibody rates are lower in cases of chemoprophylaxis. \n# Controlling the Infection at the Biological Stage\nWhen the infected vector has managed to circumvent all obstacles and inject the parasite through the cutaneous barrier, chemoprophylaxis reduces the risk that malaria-disease will develop by neutralizing the pre-erythrocytic forms of the parasite. Although chemoprophylaxis does not prevent malaria absolutelythat could be done only by destroying the sporozoites the moment the vector injected them into the host -it can be used in emergencies."
