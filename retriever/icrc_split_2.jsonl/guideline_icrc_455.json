"differential diagnosis is complicated by a number of competing syndromes. If lumbar puncture produces purulent cerebrospinal fluid, meningitis of bacterial origin can be diagnosed; but clinical examination cannot confirm a diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis unless purpura is present. In an emergency situation, health-care workers do not necessarily have access to a laboratory capable of identifying meningococcus in the cerebrospinal fluid. Agglutination techniques can be used to differentiate meningococcus from the germs responsible for other types of purulent meningitis. The health-care team may need to aim for greater or lesser diagnostic exactitude depending on whether it is facing one or two isolated cases or an already confirmed epidemic."
