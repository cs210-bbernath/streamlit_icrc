"level; the location of bullet wounds is much more variable. \n# Extent of Needs\nIn disaster and conflict situations, it is impossible to predict the number of wounded who will require care. 46 The bullet may go through various movements in the course of its trajectory: oscillations around its longitudinal axis, rotation, etc. 47 Bullets that fragment on impact cause more extensive lesions than bullets that remain intact. 48 A distinction is made between high-velocity bullets (800 m/s) and low-velocity bullets (150-200 m/s). The greater the velocity, the greater the amount of energy apt to be transferred into the body tissues."
