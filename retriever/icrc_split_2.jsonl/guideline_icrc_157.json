"Transport within a country is generally by means of trucks. For security reasons, however, in some cases only air transport may be possible, meaning a considerable increase in cost. 60 Moreover, the delivery of large quantities of food creates storage problems. Large-capacity warehouses must be found in which the food will be safe from bad weather, insects, rodents, and theft. Nor do the problems of transport and storage cease with the distribution of the food. Consideration must be given to the fact that the aid recipients must transport the food to their homes and store it. All these factors, together with the risk run by victims in conflict situations of having to ''participate in the war effort'' of one of the adversaries, 61 may influence the quantity of food given out at any one time."
