"Local production increases due to an improvement in the nutritional situation and therefore in the work force V. Supplementary Feeding\n\n# Definition\nThe terminology used to define supplementary feeding is not standardized. For example, in the UNICEF manual Assisting in Emergencies, supplementary feeding is defined as:\n''the need...to ensure that young and moderately malnourished children, pregnant and lactating women receive adequate and suitable food  The best strategy for ensuring appropriate food for these 'vulnerable groups' must be decided locally in each case on the basis of a thorough assessment of the causes of their nutritional vulnerability and the practical possibilities for reducing that vulnerability.'' 64 More specifically, the procedure is described thus:\n''Additional food is given to selected, nutritionally vulnerable individuals to compensate for specific deficiencies -in energy, protein, vitamins and mineralsin the food otherwise available to them. It is intended to be in addition to their normal share of household food, including any general emergency distributions.'' 65 The World Health Organization (WHO) manual The Management of Nutritional Emergencies in Large Populations defines the purpose of supplementary feeding as:\n''to supplement deficiencies in energy and/or nutrients, especially protein, in the basic diet of those most vulnerable to malnutrition: children under 5, pregnant or lactating women, medical cases, old people, children selected by a screening method.'' 66 The first definition equates supplementary feeding with nutritional rehabilitation. It is true that in some cases the strategy used to deal with the problem of moderate malnutrition will be the distribution of supplementary rations in addition to the general ration. This approach, however, tends to obscure the fact that supplementary feeding programs are intended for all nutritionally vulnerable groups, 67 not merely the cases of moderate malnutrition. There may also be confusion with partial feeding, as it was described in connection with general food distribution. In that context, it was defined as a complement to local food resources, provided when the latter do not offer adequate coverage of normal nutritional needs. 64 Ron Ockwell, ed., Assisting in Emergencies (UNICEF, May 1986), p."
