"Parting on friendly terms may in fact be a convenient outcome for all involved, and is usually preferable to a showdown. Substituting local services and organizations is a major problem in humanitarian action, because international agencies are increasingly accused of exploiting them and leaving little (if anything) behind when the operation is over. Humanitarian imperialism is still all too common. However, if outside support is required it is because local means have failed. As discussed earlier, humanitarian action by defi nition amounts to substitution. That being said, the extent of this substitution must be determined, as must the role and responsibilities of humanitarian actors with respect to local services and organizations. The competencies of the latter should provide the answer: the more competent they are, the more useful it is to rely on them. The less competent they are, the more capacity-building is justifi ed, and this is not always compatible with humanitarian action and is certainly not its primary role. The overarching priority, after all, is the impact of humanitarian operations on the circumstances of the victims, who should not have to pay the price for incompetence, corruption, and the failings of local means. As mentioned earlier, the ethical attitude consists in recognizing their role and, if possible, involving them directly. Implementation is then determined by local reality and may range from complete substitution to complete support, the latter meaning that the humanitarian agency does not operate directly but provides local counterparts with the means for action. Clearly, the more local counterparts are supported, the greater the responsibility for providing them with the means to pursue this effort beyond the duration of the operation at hand."
