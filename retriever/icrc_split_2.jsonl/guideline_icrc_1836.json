"# Supervision\nIn terms of supervision, comments are the same as those found in Chapter XIII, Section 3.4.1, except for meal attendance. In an SFP centre, a higher than 90% meal attendance is considered satisfactory. A lower rate usually indicates problems external to the centre rather than doubts about the quality of the services it provides."
