"MUAC variations thus indicate variations in these two tissues exclusively. As observed by Briend, the measurement of mid-upper arm circumference therefore provides a better indication of mortality risks than does weight-for-height (Briend, 1995). On the other hand, progress is measured in a TFC according to weight (once oedema, intestinal parasites, infection and infl ammation have been treated), because weight gain per kilogram provides a reliable catch-up criterion. Furthermore, muscular catch-up may occur fi rst in the lower limbs rather than the upper limbs, because the legs are solicited fi rst when children recover their mobility and curiosity. In such circumstances MUAC does not refl ect actual nutritional catch-up in the early stages of recovery."
