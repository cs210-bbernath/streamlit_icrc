"In an emergency situation, resource availability is still something to consider. However, it is most important to define as quickly as possible the crucial problems of the entire population, rather than focus on individuals first. Diphtheria, for example, is a serious disease, but relatively rare, with limited contagiousness. Measles, on the other hand, is also a serious illness, more common than diphtheria, and highly contagious. It thus represents a definite risk for vulnerable groups."
