In the case of measles, for example, the concentration of a group of vulnerable subjects probably plays a more important role in the development of an epidemic than the season during which that gathering takes place. \n# Possibilities of Intervention\nIn emergency interventions, what is theoretically possible will be conditioned by practical constraints. \n# Theoretical Effectiveness of Technical Measures\nThe technical solutions appropriate for a particular problem can be determined at the outset. This, in fact, means deciding which of the tools studied above are the most effective for controlling a given communicable disease."
