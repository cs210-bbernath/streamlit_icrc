"and where, as a result, drinking water likewise lacks iodine. The consumption of goitrogenous foods -such as cassava, bamboo shoots, sweet potato, Lima beans (butter beans) and, to a lesser extent, maize and millet -clearly increases the risk, as they contain agents that reduce the iodine availability. Apart from this, vulnerable groups cannot really be defi ned in terms of their diet, since iodine concentrations in foods are determined by the nature of the soil, and of irrigation and drinking water. Food composition tables are useless in this respect. On the other hand, the iodine levels in locally available water indicate iodine levels in the soil, which in turn determines the iodine concentrations in plants and animals in the area."
