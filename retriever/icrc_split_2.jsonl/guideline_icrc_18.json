"According to \"Primary health-care services\", the last question to be asked in the decision-making process should be this : What services are we actually going to provide in our emergency medical and health operations ? Those services 7 must constitute a response to the main pathologies encountered. Here we go a step further in our reasoning and ask the following question: with what activities shall we begin ? While this question is a common denominator of any operation (in a fixed or a mobile health facility), it is of particular importance for mobile units because of their intrinsic constraints. The choice of priority activities must be made on the basis of priority health problems. However, the order of priority will depend largely, from one situation to another, on :\nthe possibilities for implementation: local and expatriate human resources, logistical resources and, in the case of MHUs, the time to be spent on the spot, for example ; how the population perceives the situation. Example of the prioritization process for a given situation :\n1. In the case of vaccinations, when an epidemic breaks out social mobilization will take place very spontaneously as soon as information about the time and place of the vaccination campaign begins to circulate. When there is no epidemic, however, mobilization may take much more time and require more resources."
