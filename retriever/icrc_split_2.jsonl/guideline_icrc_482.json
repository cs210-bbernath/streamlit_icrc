"cases relating to the care provider's particular sphere of competence. Adjusting the number of qualified people to the mass of medical problems depends on several factors, in particular the distribution of the population. In a camp, this is a relatively minor problem, given the high population density 10 and the presence (sometimes stampede!) of health professionals. Most of the health problems are conventional ones, and a good number of them can be treated at the most peripheral level of care. An orientation based on primary health care is therefore indicated in displaced-person camps. Decentralization is essential to avoid overloading facilities at the secondary and tertiary levels (dispensaries and hospitals, respectively)."
