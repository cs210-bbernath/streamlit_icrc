"during the meal reduces iron absorption by half), and phosphorus. The absorption of iron from vegetable sources is promoted by ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and malic and citric acids. Owing to the fact that absorption is limited, the diet cannot supply enough iron when requirements rise, as is the case during pregnancy (costing approximately 700 mg), breastfeeding (approximately 175 mg during the fi rst six months), and growth. Usually, the diet cannot compensate signifi cant and/or regular losses either. \n# Iron losses\nTwo types of iron loss should be distinguished: normal loss associated with the metabolism and the functioning of the organism, and abnormal loss related to a disorder."
