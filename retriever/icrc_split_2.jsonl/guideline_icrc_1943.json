"levelling out only when the nutritional status was again satisfactory. \n# Feeding during rehabilitation\nDuring rehabilitation, the density and quantity of nutrients must be increased, and the diet must begin to diversify in order to re-accustom patients to a normal diet. In principle, the process begins with high-energy milk, subsequently alternates milk with porridge, and ends with normal meals that should be as similar as possible to the patient's after discharge. The progression of the diet is determined by staff resources, the overall workload, and the catch-up rate. The process can be gradual, and involve the supply of F-100 Formula only during the fi rst 5 days, followed by the alternation of F-100 and porridge during another 5 days, and fi nally the replacement of the porridge with normal meals until the completion of rehabilitation."
