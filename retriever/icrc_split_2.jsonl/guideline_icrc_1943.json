"A large number of factors have to be taken into consideration in responding to such emergencies and the aim of any action must always be to restore or maintain the self-suffi ciency of the affected population. Although these policies deal only with the nutritional aspects of relief operations, it is essential that they be seen within the overall context of the physical, mental and social health of the community. This has important implications for understanding nutritional problems and initiating appropriate responses. To this end, the following Policy has been drawn up by the League and the ICRC in collaboration with National Societies, Red Cross delegates and experts in the fi elds of nutrition, health and relief and is intended to make Red Cross relief operations in response to nutritional emergencies appropriate and effective. This policy will provide a guide for decision-makers of the ICRC, LORCS and the National Societies concerning: a) their response to nutritional emergencies at all stages from initial assessment and planning through to programme implementation, surveillance and evaluation; b) the recruitment and training of personnel in the nutritional aspects of relief and rehabilitation operations; c) the technical support to this policy is contained in guidelines under preparation. # Annex 6\nNational Societies are requested to assist with the dissemination, implementation and interpretation of this policy throughout the Movement."
