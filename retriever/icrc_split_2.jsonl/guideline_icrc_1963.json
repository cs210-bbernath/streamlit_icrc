Annex 8\n\n# ANNEX 8\nNORMAL DISTRIBUTION (SCHWARTZ, 1963) The normal distribution or law (also called Gaussian distribution) is a probability law that applies to quantitative, continuous, and non-limited variables. The equation of normal distribution is provided in Figure A.8.1 below. # Figure A.8.1 Probability density function\nWhere \u03bc is the average \u03c3 is the standard deviation e is the base of natural logarithms (approx. 2.718\u2026) x is the variable under scrutiny\nThe standard deviation value represents the variability of the variable under scrutiny (x). The graphic representation of normal distribution is also called a Gaussian curve."
