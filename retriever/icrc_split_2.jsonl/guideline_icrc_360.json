"pregnant women in a non-immune population exposed to endemic malaria). \n# Therapeutic Approaches\n\n# Mass Treatment\nMass treatment differs from chemoprophylaxis in that it is intended to treat within a very short time all the people susceptible to developing a given disease, the aim being to reduce propagation of the disease quickly. In contrast, the search for and systematic treatment of individuals showing the symptoms of malaria or cavitary tuberculosis are intended more to reduce mortality among these patients than to limit transmission of the disease in question. In such cases, therefore, mass treatments are not indicated. The possibility of using mass treatment for ancylostomiasis (hookworm) has been suggested."
