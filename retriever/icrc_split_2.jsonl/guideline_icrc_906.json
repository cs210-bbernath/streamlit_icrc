"assistance is guaranteed by the Geneva Conventions (in particular Arts. 3, 23, 55 and 59) and Additional Protocols I (in particular Arts. 69 and 70) and II (Art. 18). The responsibility for organizing relief is clearly explained in the commentary on the Additional Protocols of 1977. 20 The authorities in charge have the primary role:\n''The whole of the provision is based on the principle that States are primarily responsible for organizing relief. Relief societies such as the Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations are called upon to play an auxiliary role by assisting the authorities in their task.'' 21 External assistance enters the picture if the authorities are unable to meet their obligations: ''Such external aid is complementary; it is only provided when the responsible authorities can no longer meet the basic necessities of the civilian population whose survival is in jeopardy.'' 22 It is important that health-care personnel understand this division of responsibility well."
