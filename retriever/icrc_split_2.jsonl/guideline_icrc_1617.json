"Soup kitchens require energy and resources, and the return on this investment must be evaluated. The evolution of the nutritional status provides a useful indicator as it can be measured on all individuals or on specifi c subjects that have been registered on a set date. Permanent dialogue involving the benefi ciaries, kitchen staff and the agency in charge permits adjustments to the work according to the evolution of the nutritional situation, and to the positive and negative effects of the kitchen programme."
