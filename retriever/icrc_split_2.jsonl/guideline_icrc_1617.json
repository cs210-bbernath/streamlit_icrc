"stake -even in such extreme cases, the approach often fails. Direct distribution involves the use of food in two forms: take-away rations and meals to be eaten, if possible, on the spot (Section 3.5 on distribution modalities below discusses the criteria for selecting the best form). Take-away rations are delivered in the form of survival rations, parcels that contain the entire ration (and possibly other relief items), or distribution from bulk consignments (e.g. scooping).
