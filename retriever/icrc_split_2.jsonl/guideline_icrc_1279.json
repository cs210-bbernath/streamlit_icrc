"The circumference is recorded to the nearest millimetre. # Oedema\nOedema of the lower limbs is not an anthropometric variable, but is documented in the course of the appraisal of the nutritional status simultaneously with anthropometry; as a result, it is discussed here. In children, oedema of the lower limbs usually indicates kwashiorkor-type severe malnutrition. 24 Oedema can be recognized by applying strong fi nger pressure to the arch of the foot or the inside ankle for approximately three seconds; in the case of oedema, this pressure leaves a depression or pit (pitting oedema) that can be seen and felt easily. Oedema must then be sought on the other leg also: only bilateral oedema has nutritional implications. As a reminder, bilateral oedema of the lower limbs in adolescents and adults equally indicate severe malnutrition. However, since adult oedema may have different causes, their nutritional origin must be established, especially in the sedentary elderly, and this is not easily done. # Measurement standardization or normalization\nIt is best to practice before each measurement session or assessment in order to ensure that measurements are properly made, reproducible, and are similar."
