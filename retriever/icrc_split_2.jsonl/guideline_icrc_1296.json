", 1985). This classifi cation is derived from the thresholds provided in a WHO report on energy and protein requirements (WHO, 1985). A more recent WHO technical report on anthropometry suggests different cut-off points for adults, without distinction of sex. However, the weight of women is lower than that of men for the same height (WHO;. According to this classifi cation, a BMI greater than or equal to 18.5 indicates a normal nutritional status; between 18.4 and 17 the subject is mildly malnourished, between 16 and 16.9 it is moderately malnourished, and below 16, it is severely malnourished. The choice of 18.5 as the cut-off point for normality is explained by the fact that health problems are not observed in BMI cases located above that threshold. However, experience in prisons in several countries shows that most adults whose BMI lies between 18.5 and 20 are wasted with respect to the nutritional status that would be theirs if access to food were suffi cient, and that their physical capacity is substantially diminished. This observation was in fact confi rmed in the case of a specifi c prison in which undernourished and highly wasted inmates fi nally gained unlimited access to an adequate diet. Their food consumption initially rose dramatically, and then stabilized. Measurements taken three weeks after stabilization indicated an average 22 BMI, with a 1.9 standard deviation. Clearly, a balance had been found between dietary intake and energy expenditure. As a result, the new WHO classifi cation may tend to underestimate mild malnutrition in adult males; this can have serious consequences for humanitarian action. Moreover, the suggested brackets imply a 7.5% weight loss between mild and moderate malnutrition, and only a 6% one between moderate and severe malnutrition: is such sophistication really necessary?"
