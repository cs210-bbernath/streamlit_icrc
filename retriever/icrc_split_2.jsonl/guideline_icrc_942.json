"Ethical issues arise on two levels: the needs of the victims, and the potential of local services. # Victims' Needs\n\n# The Concept of Vital Needs\nIn a situation of armed conflict, all the humanitarian organizations agree that the main focus should be on vital needs -that is, those needs that must be met first if the victims are to survive: access to food, access to health-care services, access to water, etc. In developing countries, a population's normal needs are in fact limited to vital needs, so the humanitarian agencies hardly need to deliberate over what should be done. In a different sociocultural context, where essential needs are covered by local services, the demands of the victims and the authorities concern non-vital needs which are normally met. A humanitarian intervention, then, will restore the balance that existed before the crisis. There is no ethical problem here. However, if levels of intervention are compared by country, the question arises whether this extension of ''needs'' into the non-essential realm does not lead to a double standard, since interventions to help populations in developing countries will be limited to vital needs, while those for developed countries will be expanded to other domains. Is it possible to limit the concept of impartiality to a given context, and to adjust the aid given to victims of a particular country to its usual standard of living? Or should the concept of impartiality be carried to a much more global level? If the latter, perhaps all victims of conflicts should be treated alike, whatever the previous sociocultural level. Everyone knows that different emergencies are not equally ''interesting'' to donors. Given this fact, it may be tempting to define the standard in a particular situation on the basis of the resources provided by the international community. This idea is unacceptable, however, for it merely reinforces the tendency of certain humanitarian agencies to intervene only in dramatic situations, to the detriment of situations that are more catastrophic but offer no political or media interest. The preceding chapters of this book defined the ethical bottom line for intervention. Determining the upper limit is more difficult."
