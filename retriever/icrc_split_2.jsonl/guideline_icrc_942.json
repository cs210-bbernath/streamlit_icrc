"agencies hardly need to deliberate over what should be done. In a different sociocultural context, where essential needs are covered by local services, the demands of the victims and the authorities concern non-vital needs which are normally met. A humanitarian intervention, then, will restore the balance that existed before the crisis. There is no ethical problem here. However, if levels of intervention are compared by country, the question arises whether this extension of ''needs'' into the non-essential realm does not lead to a double standard, since interventions to help populations in developing countries will be limited to vital needs, while those for developed countries will be expanded to other domains."
