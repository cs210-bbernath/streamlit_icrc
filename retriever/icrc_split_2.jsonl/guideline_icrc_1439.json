"the following general recommendations facilitate the choice of sampling method. 9 Simple random sampling is ideal in its orthodox form. This involves the complete and updated census of subjects, and unrestricted access to the entire population, because all subjects must have equal probability of being selected. Census itself may be performed independently, but is time-consuming. The region under consideration may be restricted deliberately to accessible areas; and data for inaccessible areas must then be obtained indirectly. Time can represent a major constraint if the subjects are scattered and diffi cult to locate. 9 Systematic random sampling is recommended in regions where subjects are geographically distributed (this facilitates their location)."
