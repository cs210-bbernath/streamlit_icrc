"energy and protein requirements without resorting to artifi cial milks. \n\n# WEIGHT-FOR-AGE AND WEIGHT-FOR-HEIGHT OF ADOLESCENTS 1\nIn humanitarian operations, the indicator of nutritional status that must be measured is usually corpulence. Unfortunately, there are no weight-for-height tables that apply to adolescents. This Manual therefore combines existing tables for height for age and weight for age for girls and boys aged between 2 and 18 years (WHO, 1983). Results are provided within one centimetre, rounded up to the closest category as an approximate where necessary. Height rounded up to the closest centimetre is indicated between brackets alongside the approximate height."
