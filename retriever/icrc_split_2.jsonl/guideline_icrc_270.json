"larva ? adult anopheles ? infection by a parasite carrier ? transmission of the infection\n\n# Controlling the Problem\nThe preceding pages show that vector control depends in large part on the measures taken to dispose of waste. In emergency situations, however, time is sometimes needed to explain to the beneficiaries the impact of these measures on vector proliferation. In this case, relief workers may have to resort to more specific methods of control. These should not, however, take the place of basic hygiene and become ''the solution.''\n\n# Physical Intervention\nPhysical intervention may include:\n-drainage of rain water and waste water -prevention of overcrowding -use of traps designed for a specific type of vector, such as flies or rats -use of mosquito nets\n\n# Chemical Intervention\nChemical intervention involves the use of chemical products, mainly insecticides and rat poisons. These products have only a temporary effect unless they are accompanied by the measures mentioned above. Moreover, their use may be detrimental:\n-to the health of those who handle them; -to the health of beneficiaries, if the rules concerning the concentration to be used, the mode of delivery, etc., are not respected; -to long-term vector control, since in the long term improper use may lead to the development of resistant vector strains, as was the case with anopheles and DDT. # Methods of Vector Control\nVector-control methods are one of the forms of primary prevention of communicable diseases. They act on two levels:\n- reduction of vector proliferation by:\n-drainage -insecticides -larvicides -vector traps - reduction of opportunities for contact between vectors and healthy humans:\n-mosquito nets -repellents -long garments\n\n# Combined Modes of Intervention\nVector control involves the implementation of various kinds of methods which can be combined in different ways:\n-Type of measure -physical -chemical -Mode of action -reduction of vector population -reduction of contact with humans Thus, to control anopheles, the actions best suited to the situation would be chosen from among the following:\n. drainage of stagnant water \n\n# use of insect repellents\nIn the battle against malaria, for example, the technical measures selected will depend on both the population's way of life and that of the mosquitoes in the area concerned. 49 These measures would be combined, as well, with public health activities (health education) and medical care (treatment of the sick). One of the methods currently recommended is the use of mosquito nets soaked in insecticide (pyrethroids). Many studies have shown that this practice reduces transmission. As in every case where insecticides are used, the risk of resistant strains appearing must be continually assessed."
