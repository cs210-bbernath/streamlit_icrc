"Cash distributions and credit facilities are another option, but they demand professional input. Either way, the sale of food in order to optimize the utilization of resources is not a negative effect itself, and certainly does not invite moral judgment. Forced transaction on the other hand can occur because the assistance delivered does not provide all the appropriate vital commodities: typical additional commodities include foodstuffs that complement the delivered ration, milled cereals (if cereals are distributed in grain, some payment must be supplied for their milling), cooking utensils, fuel, clothing, and construction material. If GFD rations constitute the only resource and are calculated on energy requirements alone, then they will be insuffi cient to satisfy both nutritional and economic needs. In such cases, malnutrition persists where it already exists, or it develops. Clearly, then, the sale or exchange of food rations cannot be viewed as a negative effect; what is negative is providing insuffi cient assistance, and then accusing its destitute recipients of diverting it. On the contrary, assistance must be corrected as early as possible in order for it to satisfy the overall need for aid."
