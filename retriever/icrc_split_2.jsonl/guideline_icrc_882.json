"the maintenance of peace were examined in the previous chapter. There is, on the national level, the connection established between peace and the promotion of human rights, and, on the international level, the necessary inter-State cooperation aimed at promoting the development of the most disadvantaged nations. Peace and development are linked: development is essential to reduce the risks of armed conflict, while peace is a prerequisite for development. Also noted was the importance of the challenges humanity will face during the next decades. If these challenges are not met, they are liable to increase the risk of armed conflicts between nations."
