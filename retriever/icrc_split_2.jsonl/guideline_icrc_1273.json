"As a result, it does not meet the objectives of humanitarian action, which for example cannot be delayed until 30% of a given population has lost 20% of its weight. Aid would in this case be too late; but it may also be too late if the situation improves before its delivery -aid would then be redundant. Rather than a poor nutritional status, the risk of deterioration should be the criterion for action. Nutritional status is in this case an indicator among others in the decision-making process. In assessment, it serves to test hypotheses, to monitor developments, to measure the impact of operations or the severity of a situation and, for example, to select individuals for inclusion in therapeutic feeding programmes."
