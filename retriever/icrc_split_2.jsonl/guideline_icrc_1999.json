"It does not provide indications as to their nature, which remains to be defi ned in more specifi c objectives. 9 Specifi c objectives: q to distribute rations of 2,250 kcal/day to 300,000 persons in region X from 15 July up until the March harvest of the following year -the expected impact here is not reiterated, as it is clearly stated in the general objective. q to vaccinate at least 90% of the children under 6 years old against measles by the end of July -the expected impact here is defi ned indirectly by the vaccination coverage, and the indication of location would be redundant. q to ensure that all water supply points in region X provide safe drinking water by the end of October -the expected impact here is a corollary of the nature of the objective, and implies that the water is so far unsafe and its consumption thus entails a risk of secondary malnutrition. q to supply the 23 existing health centres with essential drugs; q to establish 9 therapeutic feeding centres of an individual capacity of 500 patients each by mid-September, in order to admit 25% of the most serious cases of severe malnutrition in children under 6 years old. Each of the above specifi c objectives must then be converted into precise activities, such as:\n9 the monthly distribution of 10 kg of cereals, 2 kg of enriched cereals, 2 l of enriched oil, and 3 kg of pulses to each of 300,000 persons in region X; 9 the monthly provision of X tonnes of aluminium sulphate required for the operation of the water supply system in region X; 9 and so forth. This increasingly precise operational description shows that specifi c objectives are the means to achieve general objectives. This logical sequence of means and objectives frequently causes confusion in drafting objectives. Ranking the objectives and defi ning them precisely contribute to: 9 the exact description of intended action; 9 the quantitative and qualitative appraisal of the implementation of objectives; 9 the setting of realistic objectives that can indeed be achieved; 9 the relevance of activities and specifi c objectives to the general objective; 9 the acceptability of specifi c objectives for all stakeholders; 9 the setting of realistic and specifi c timeframes. This leads to the general rule regarding objectives, which must be SMART: 9 Specifi c; 9 Measurable; 9 Achievable; 9 Relevant; 9 Time-bound (or time-dependent). The defi nition of objectives must include indicators from the onset: they are essential to the subsequent monitoring and evaluation of the operation."
