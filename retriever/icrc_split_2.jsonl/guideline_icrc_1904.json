"Being liquid it can be consumed by the very young, the very weak and the sick. It can be eaten soured, as cream, as yoghurt, as cheese or as an ingredient with other foods. Human breast milk is the perfect balanced food for the human baby. Breast milk alone will provide all the nutrients a baby needs for at least the fi rst 4 months of life. If breast milk is not available for the small baby, alternative milks (most commonly cow's milk) can be used to feed the child during this critical time. With the introduction of a mixed diet and the development of teeth, the importance of milk declines steadily. Milk is rarely a major part of the adult diet except in pastoral populations who move with and largely live off their animals. 1 shows the food values of human milk compared to cow's milk. Table 2 shows the food values of milk before dilution. Dried whole milk (DWM) which retains its full cream content, if properly reconstituted will provide values much the same as for fresh cow's milk. Dried skimmed milk (DSM) will have a very low energy value (between 30-40 kcal per 100 ml of liquid milk after reconstitution). Skimmed milk will also have had the fat soluble vitamins removed (most important being Vitamin A)."
