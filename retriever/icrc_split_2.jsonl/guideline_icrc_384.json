"are based on the systematic immunization of groups at risk. In contrast, immunization does not have the same significance in the control of meningitis. Most of the programs or activities coming under the heading of a general control program for one or another of these diseases have already been discussed in connection with communicable diseases, the environment, and food and nutrition. Thus, rather than trying to describe each activity in detail, this section will merely list them, assessing the relative importance of each with respect to the others in terms of its potential to influence the final outcome favorably. To facilitate presentation, the recommended control regimens will be organized according to the natural cycle of the disease, as described at the beginning of this chapter."
