"# V. Examples of Programs to Control Communicable Diseases\nCommunicable diseases can be controlled by proper coordination of a series of measures implemented for that purpose. The combinations possible depend on both the diseases in question and the context in which they are found. The constraints of emergency situations -particularly conflicts -limit the possibility of taking all the steps which, together, would control the communicable diseases effectively. The integrated, multidisciplinary approaches that can be instituted in an emergency, given the factors just mentioned, will be examined through the following examples:\n& malaria & measles & diarrheal diseases (cholera) & tuberculosis & meningococcal meningitis & intestinal parasitic infestation\nThese diseases do not necessarily constitute priorities as defined earlier, but as examples they serve as ''puzzles'' in which the different pieces vary in importance according to the disease. The intervention strategies for measles and poliomyelitis are fairly similar, in that they are based on the systematic immunization of groups at risk. In contrast, immunization does not have the same significance in the control of meningitis. Most of the programs or activities coming under the heading of a general control program for one or another of these diseases have already been discussed in connection with communicable diseases, the environment, and food and nutrition."
