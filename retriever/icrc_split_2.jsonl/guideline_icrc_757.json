"malnutrition, if households do not have access to food resources. Similarly, the establishment of a water-supply system goes hand in hand with waste removal, since otherwise the waste is liable to contaminate the water sources. Clearly, these programs are complementary. The cold induces an additional expenditure of individual energy, while food intake is usually inadequate. The distribution of clothing and blankets and the provision of satisfactory housing therefore ''cover'' nutritional needs to some degree. Health-education programs, set up during the acute phase of emergency situations, are essential at all levels of prevention, if the population is to derive maximal benefit from them."
