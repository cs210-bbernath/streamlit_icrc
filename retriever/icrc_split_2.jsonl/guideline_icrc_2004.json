"become adequate; the SFP's modalities can then be modifi ed. \n# Contributing to a more effective response to moderate malnutrition\nOnce preventive measures are in place, SFPs can prove useful in accelerating the reduction of moderate malnutrition. This scenario illustrates what has been discussed in Section 2.1.1.A above, where the same criteria -children under 5 or whose height is inferior to 110 cm, suffering from moderate malnutrition -apply to admission and discharge. Feeding also takes place in an SFP centre, where benefi ciaries have access to adequate healthcare and possibly nutritional information sessions. The selection of benefi ciaries is made as described in Section 2.1.1.A. Furthermore, the public is informed of the active search for cases on the basis of household visits as soon as the SFP centres have the capacity to register new cases and the population is presenting fewer moderately malnourished children."
