"# Interaction Between a Population and its Environment\nA list of the environmental factors that influence a population's health status and a parallel list of the human factors that influence environmental hygiene together provide an outline of their reciprocal action. # Types of Interaction\nAccess to food resources, food hygiene, the quantity and quality of water available, construction material and available sources of energy, the presence of communicable-disease vectors -all these are factors that directly influence health status. At the same time, the population itself helps pollute the environment and exhaust environmental resources by the quantities of solid (garbage, human excreta) and liquid waste it dumps, and by the pressure it exerts on that environment through overpopulation. This interaction has disastrous consequences -for example, the pollution of drinking water by human waste and the exhaustion of energy resources (wood). This process is a vicious circle that should be broken quickly if health is to be preserved."
