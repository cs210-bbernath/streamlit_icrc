It facilitates the monitoring of highly health-vulnerable benefi ciaries, who can rapidly fall prey to negative side effects which can only be mitigated through strict control. 15 On the other hand, when an SFP targets a group rather than malnutrition specifi cally, it probably makes more sense to distribute take-away rations. \n# Activities in an SFP centre\nIn centres where food rations are eaten on a daily basis, the range of activities is wider than in a centre supplying take-away rations, where it consists of the registration and discharge of benefi ciaries, monitoring their nutritional and health status, and the distribution of food."
