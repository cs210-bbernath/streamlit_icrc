"The more insuffi cient the means are, the more the response to harm will be insuffi cient, and the more serious the problem becomes. Gaps at this level indicate an insuffi cient performance. 9 In order to demonstrate danger, the qualitative and quantitative gap between normal behaviour and the observed behaviour must be measured. The further the observed behaviour departs from normal behaviour, the more likely the response to harm will be abnormal, and the more serious the problem becomes. Gaps at this level indicate diffi culty in preserving a suffi cient performance, and the additional risks in attempting to do so."
