"Parenteral feeding (i.e. intravenous) must be avoided at all costs. As a reminder, when a TFC is opened in response to crisis, therapeutic feeding follows a routine approach for all individuals suffering from the same type of defi ciency. As a general rule, excessively diffi cult or miserable cases should not be accepted. This rule will doubtless seem restrictive to experienced medical staff; qualifi ed staff should therefore decide for themselves, provided that they take full responsibility for prescribed treatments, and that the additional time and energy that is devoted to such cases is not detrimental to the overall TFC operation. Some subjects show particular aversion to therapeutic feeding; such behaviour should suggest the presence of specifi c pathologies such as congenital anomalies, tumours, and disorders of the immune system and vital organs. These conditions also prevail where primary malnutrition due to poverty or famine is common."
