"# Do All the Victims Have Access to Essential Services? If discrimination exists (based on political affiliation, ethnic origin, etc.), all humanitarian agencies will condemn it to one extent or another, but the practical problem remains: what should be done for the victims? The main factor in deciding if intervention is justified is whether the needs not being met because of discrimination are vital or not. After all, if the victims face a vital risk, it is ethically difficult to do nothing but censure the authorities responsible for the discrimination. Intervention in this case must be accompanied by negotiations with the authorities to try to change their attitude. # Is the Quality of the Local Services Satisfactory? The local authorities may judge the services offered to the victims to be of good quality, whereas outside observers would consider them inadequate. A distinction should be made between services that are inadequate because the personnel lack the resources necessary to do their work properly, and services that are inadequate because the local personnel has no interest in the victims. In the first case, humanitarian agencies can remedy the observed deficit; in the second case, it is difficult to do anything about lack of motivation in workers who themselves may be struggling to survive. # Decision-Making\nIn practice, deciding whether or not to intervene is not as simple as might be supposed from the basic concept, which is to intervene if local services are not able to cover the victims' vital needs."
