"Nevertheless, the unreliability and irregularity of the data should be taken into account. # Analysis of Results\nAnalyzing the information collected is the crucial point of every initial assessment, since it leads to the decision-making process. An incorrect appraisal of the situation may have disastrous consequences. Three cardinal rules must be respected: \nData\n\n# quality of care and level of development\n\n# Data should serve as a basis for projections over time\nProjection over time is the most difficult level of analysis. A given situation will often develop haphazardly, even over a short time span."
