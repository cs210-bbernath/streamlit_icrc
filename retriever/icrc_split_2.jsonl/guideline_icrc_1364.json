"In terms of civilians, the underlying principle of such rules is the distinction between bearers of weapons and civilians. The principle of this distinction is reiterated in article 48 of Protocol I, and provides the basis for the rule set out in articles 51 of Protocol I and 13 of Protocol II, according to which civilians shall not be the object of attack. Thus, starvation may be a common reality in armed confl ict; it is fortunately not accepted as inevitable by the international community, which has converted this refusal into international humanitarian law. Clearly, this area of international humanitarian law is especially sensitive, because limitations to the conduct of hostilities must allow for military priorities."
