"The necessary quantity of water is determined by the number of patients: usual recommendations are 30 to 50 litres per patient per day. This amount allows for all the water requirements of the centre (consumption, care, and cleaning), and corresponds to the needs commonly observed in disasters in developing countries. The absolute minimum is 10 litres per patient per day, and this involves drastic water saving and recycling measures. In supplementary feeding centres where meals are consumed on the spot (see Chapter XIV), at least 10 litres of water per person per day must be allowed for. # Sanitation\nHygiene is very important in a TFC."
