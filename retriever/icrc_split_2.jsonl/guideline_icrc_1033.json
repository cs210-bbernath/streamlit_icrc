"It is also the promoter and custodian of humanitarian law. In practice, ICRC delegates oversee the application of the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols through their presence in the field, for example when visiting prisoners of war. They forward their observations to the parties in conflict and make recommendations. The ICRC is also charged with ensuring the protection and assistance of the victims of armed conflicts and internal disturbances (letter d above). It has many activities in this respect, in particular relief operations for the civilian population (food, medical care, shelter, drinking water, etc.). Its Central Tracing Agency forwards messages between the members of families separated by war, traces the missing and makes it possible for families to be reunited."
