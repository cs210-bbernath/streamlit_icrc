"light, moderate or heavy), and demographic composition. Table 12.2 below provides three examples of ration calorie content:\n9 WHO 1: this ration is based on recommended intakes for a population whose demographic profi le is found in developing countries (de Ville de Goyet, 1978); 9 WHO 2 is recommended by the World Health Organization, the WFP and the UNHCR as a reference ration for humanitarian action in developing countries (WHO, 2000); 9 WHO 3 is recommended by the World Health Organization as a reference ration for humanitarian action in developed countries (WHO, 2000). a Approximate age group proportion within the population according to its profi le. # GFD implementation 3.2 Setting rations\nIn Table 12.2 above, the level of adult physical activity and their weight account for most of the discrepancies between WHO 1 and WHO 2 average requirements. In WHO 1, adults are assumed to be moderately active, with an average weight of 65 kg for men, and 55 kg for women. In WHO 2, adults are lightly active, with an average weight of 60 kg for men, and 52 kg for women. The WHO recommends an average supplement of 140 kcal (585 kJ) for a moderately active population, and 350 kcal (1,460 kJ) for a highly active population; this raises the WHO 2 average ration to 2,220 kcal (9,280 kJ) and 2,430 kcal (10,160 kJ) respectively. Transposing adult intakes recommended in WHO 1 to WHO 2 raises the average daily ration to 2,270 kcal (9,470 kJ). With respect to the intakes recommended by Latham for developing countries, the reference adult male weighs 63 kg, and his average daily energy requirements are 2,895 kcal (12,100 kJ); the reference adult female weighs 55 kg, and her average daily energy requirements are 2,210 kcal (9,240 kJ) (Latham, 1997). Applying this level of requirements to WHO 2 adults raises the average daily ration to 2,243 kcal (9,375 kJ)."
