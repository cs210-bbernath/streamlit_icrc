"to provide the starting point for cluster selection, say 455. The fi rst cluster is then attributed to the sub-section that corresponds to 455, in this example, sub-section 2. The following clusters are obtained by adding 1,000 (the interval) to the fi rst number (455): 1,455; 2,455 (both are included in section 2, like the fi rst value 455); 3,455 (section 3); 4,455; 5,455; 6,455; 7,455 (all included in section 4); and so on. The advantage of this method is that the number of clusters taken from each section is proportional to the population of the section. According to results, signifi cant differences may appear between sections, and the causes may then be investigated more thoroughly."
