"Validation : this technique should be validated by another method of investigation (for example, data furnished by the health services). # Immunization\nThis section will review the main elements of an immunization program, analyzing in succession:\n. the indications for an immunization program\nthe stages of implementing it\nthe method for evaluating it\n\n# Indications for an Immunization Program\nSome of the communicable diseases responsible for the high mortality rate found in displaced-persons' camps can be easily prevented by immunization. However, the situation must be analyzed to determine which diseases should take priority and what vaccinations are possible. # Defining the Magnitude of the Problem\nThe immediate impact of a disease is of less interest than its potential impact. Relief agencies should not wait until an epidemic of measles is declared to begin considering an immunization campaign (which by then would not be much use). This reasoning, however, does not apply to all the communicable diseases for which a vaccine exists. For example, there is no point in launching an immunization campaign against meningitis if no cases of the disease have been diagnosed in the population. The approach, then, will vary according to the disease. It should be based essentially on the following criteria:\n-Size of the group likely to develop the disease The size of the group likely to develop the disease depends on several factors. One of them is the degree of immunity already conferred either by a case of the disease (regardless of immunization campaigns, practically all subjects over the age of five have had measles) or by a previous immunization campaign. The risk of contracting progressive tuberculosis does not depend on age. Although the entire population may be ''at risk,'' some groups are nevertheless in greater danger than others: malnourished individuals, the family members of a tubercular subject with positive sputum, AIDS patients."
