"This happens mostly in cases where people are besieged in cities or forcibly confined to limited areas which contain no water sources. Another kind of vital risk is the danger of dying from diarrheal illnesses induced by the consumption of polluted water. # Morbidity\nWater plays an important role in transmitting certain infectious diseases, particularly diarrheal illnesses. 9 To avoid memorizing a long, indigestible list of diseases that can be transmitted by water, we can categorize them by the mechanism of transmission. # Presence of Water\nThe mere presence of water favors the proliferation of insects, or water-related vectors, which transmit, for example, the following diseases:\n\n# malaria (mosquitoes)\n\n# yellow fever (mosquitoes)\n\n# dengue fever (mosquitoes)\n\n# arboviruses (mosquitoes)\n\n# sleeping sickness (flies)\n\n# onchocerciasis (flies)\nIt should be kept in mind that water is not an isolated factor, but contributes to disease in combination with other factors: fecal contamination, lack of health education, etc. # Recommendations for Supplying Water\nQUANTITY: 20 liters of water per day and per person QUALITY:\n- Physical characteristics: -appearance -smell -taste - Microbiological constants:\n-0-10 E. coli/100 ml - Chemical constants: -arsenic < 0.05 mg/l -fluoride < 1.5 mg/l -cyanides < 0.1 mg/l -mercury < 0.001 mg/l -lead < 0.05 mg/l\n\n# Contact with Water\nIn areas where schistosomiasis is endemic, mere contact with water infested by cercariae (the mature larva of the schistosoma) is sufficient for the transmission of schistosomiasis. 10 Water Quality\nThe contamination of drinking water by pathogenic agents causes or increases the incidence of certain diseases, classified as waterborne diseases:\n. diarrheal\n\n# leptospirosis\n\n# infectious hepatitis\nThe severity of the disease is related to the quantity of pathogens ingested. This feature has been studied particularly in diarrheal diseases."
