"eats over a given period; sampling however produces reliable results. Therefore, samples consisting of 30 to 40 households are questioned systematically in order to establish what they eat during a 24-hour period. It is worth noting that the assessment of food consumption must include direct observation and measurements (weighing the food).

This involves obtaining information as to breastfeeding practices, the number of daily meals, and the specifi city (or its absence) of infant feeding, especially during weaning."
