"CHWs may need to carry out in a given context. Standardization is particularly important in emergency situations. First, it should be remembered that in countries requiring relief assistance standard procedures usually already exist for treating the main pathologies, such as tuberculosis, malaria, and diarrheal diseases. Humanitarian agencies should try at the outset to standardize procedures, in order to harmonize their own emergency procedures with those employed by the health ministry. Occasionally, relief agencies may institute specific procedures which do not correspond to those advocated by the health ministry. A case in point is the introduction of short-term treatments for tuberculosis in refugee camps, when the host countries offer their own populations the conventional, long-term therapy."
