"increase as the crisis develops and preventive measures remain ineffective. If the population under consideration is large and concentrated, low rates of moderate malnutrition would justify the opening of one or several SFP centres; on the other hand, if the population is small and scattered, even high malnutrition rates may not necessarily be conclusive. Furthermore, the objective of the SFP is also the deciding factor: if the purpose is to contain a crisis, one can begin with twenty benefi ciaries, while preparing to accommodate a thousand in the coming months. If it is to provide a safety net, one can also begin with a few dozens, for instance by linking the SFP centre with a health facility or paediatric service."
