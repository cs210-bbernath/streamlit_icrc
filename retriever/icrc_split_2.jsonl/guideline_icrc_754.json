"PHC involves three aspects. # The Political Aspect\nThe basis of the political aspect of PHC was enunciated in the declaration of Alma-Ata: '' international commitment to primary health care should be oriented to support national primary health care programmes by creating a positive climate of opinion; by facilitating the exchange of expertise, technology and information through technical cooperation among developing countries and between industrialized and developing countries; and by encouraging proper orientation of financial resources. However, all international agencies, non-governmental agencies and countries providing support have to be aware that the purpose of their efforts is in the long run to enable countries themselves to apply primary health care as part of their overall development and in the spirit of self-reliance.'' 4 Primary health care is a strategic option aimed at achieving the objectives established by the Conference of Alma-Ata: 5 ''Primary health care forms an integral part of the country health system, of which it is the central function and main agent for delivering health care. It is also an integral part of the overall social and economic development of the community.'' 6 WHO has distilled from this approach the basic principles for the development of a health-care system:\n''-The system should encompass the entire population on the basis of equality and reciprocity. -The system should include components from the health sector and from other sectors whose interrelated actions contribute to health. -Primary health care should consist of at least the essential elements enunciated in the Declaration of Alma-Ata. -The other elements of the health system should support the first contact level of primary health care to permit it to provide these essential elements on a continuing basis. -At intermediate levels, more complex problems should be dealt with, more skilled and specialized care as well as logistic support should be provided, and more highly trained staff should provide continuing training to primary health care workers -as well as guidance to communities and community health workers on practical problems arising in connection with all aspects of primary health care. -The central level should coordinate all parts of the system and provide planning and management expertise in aspects that are common to all institutions in the country.'' 7 4 WHO, Alma Ata, A Joint Report of WHO and UNICEF (1978), p. 79."
