"where the MHUs are now the only health service available. -In the Vanni region of Sri Lanka, MHUs initially provided curative services but gradually moved towards an educational function for community health workers. In Trincomalee, a Ministry of Health nurse joined the MHU team, giving prenatal consultations and administering vaccinations. \n# MHUs can be a strategy for emergency medical and health operations\nOnce the conditions to be treated have been selected and priorities set for the corresponding activities, and taking into account intrinsic (the MHUs) and extrinsic (the environment) constraints, MHUs may, for a limited period, constitute a strategy for providing treatment and other services."
