The use of substitution formulae (according to Cameron & Hofvander, 1983) The total volume for children up to 6 months of age is 150 ml of substitution formula per kg of body weight per day, to be spread out over 5 meals per day, that is, 30 ml per kg of body weight per meal. Meals should be spaced out according to 3 to 4 hour intervals, and children should be fed on demand (as for breastfeeding)."
