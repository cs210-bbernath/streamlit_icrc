"The answers depend on an analysis of the local health-care system's capacity to cope with the situation. 21 Too much space would be required to analyze all the facets of a health-care system here; this section will be limited to medical facilities and how they can be analyzed with the help of a flow chart. # Accessibility of the\n\n# The Basic Problem\nIn developing countries, most of the health-care services are insufficient to respond to the needs of the population. This is the reason, for example, for the congestion of health-care facilities and the long waiting lines at water distribution points. This problem leads to dysfunction in these facilities and a lack of motivation in health-care personnel, who are swamped by a demand they cannot satisfy, and in the populations themselves, who hesitate to turn to the health-care services. In an emergency situation, demand is especially great, and without rational organization, services 22 are quickly overwhelmed. Certainly, a doubling of the population in the space of a few weeks in a city of average size often strains the capacity of hospital facilities intolerably. Nor is the quantitative aspect the only issue; emergency situations are often characterized by the presence of needs, particularly medical ones, which differ from conventional medical needs. One example is war wounds, which require a particular approach involving triage, special operating procedures, and so on. The quality of the care provided by the local services is difficult to evaluate."
