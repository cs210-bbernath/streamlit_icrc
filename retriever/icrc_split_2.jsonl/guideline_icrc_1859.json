"The child must be given to the breast at birth (at most one hour after birth). In most cases, neonates begin to suckle immediately, thus stimulating milk production and at the same time promoting the emotional bond with their mother. 3. The child must be left with its mother permanently after birth, as this promotes milk production. The child must be fed on demand, as soon as it becomes agitated or cries -in most cases this indicates nothing but hunger. During the fi rst weeks, neonates may need to feed up to 10 times per 24 hours. NUTRITION MANUAL 5. The themes of Chapter XV -Nutritional information nutritional information 5.2 Feeding infants and small children 4.
