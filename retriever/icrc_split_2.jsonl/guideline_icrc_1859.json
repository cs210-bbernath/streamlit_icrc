"in a closed place, sheltered from insects and other pests. \n\n# Feeding\nFeeding is the most important activity in a TFC -that is its justifi cation. It is however also initially the most complicated, because severely malnourished subjects are apathetic and irritable, lack appetite, and are generally diffi cult to feed. Success in this endeavour is determined by the observance of a number of rules. 1. Feeding bottles are strictly prohibited: they are diffi cult to clean and, above all, their use is harmful for breastfeeding. 2. Oral feeding is to be attempted at all costs from the outset, using a mug and spoon."
