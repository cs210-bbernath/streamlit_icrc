"greatest hygiene problems in poor countries and in a crisis. Access to water, and to the fuel required to boil it, is often complicated. Generally speaking, water must be collected and kept in a clean, covered container that is cleaned frequently. The equipment used to draw water must serve no other purpose, and must be cleaned regularly. Water should be kept in different containers according to whether it is intended for drinking, the preparation of meals, domestic cleaning chores, or personal hygiene. If fuel is scarce, boiling may be limited to the water used to prepare the meals of small children and for drinking."
