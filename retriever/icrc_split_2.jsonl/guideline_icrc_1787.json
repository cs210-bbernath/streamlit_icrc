"specifi c queue according to how many members it comprises. Each queue is channelled by ropes, and leads to the card verifi cation desk (see below). The population then reports to the other attention points (where relevant, for example nutritional measurement, or vitamin A supplementation) -food distribution points must always be the last stop. Cards are verifi ed once again and perforated before benefi ciaries receive their ration; this ensures that their hands are free to receive the goods, and at the same time avoids people evading the perforation process after receiving their entitlement and then queuing for a second delivery."
