"Figure 10.16 below provides an example of transect for an African village. # Seasonal calendars\nSeasonal calendars are useful in rural environments where production varies throughout the year. They can refl ect all signifi cant events occurring during the year. Seasonal calendars should ideally be established for a period of 18 months, in order to refl ect seasonal cross-over periods.

Whatever the ultimate approach, calendars must indicate the reference year."
