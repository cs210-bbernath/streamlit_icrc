"to receive the care or instructions suited to their condition. These tools are:\n. ranking medical problems in order of priority (''triage'');\n. approaching problems individually;\n. standardizing methods, drugs, and supplies;\n. training health-care personnel;\n. planning medical facilities. When a displaced-person or refugee camp is first set up, it rarely has all the health personnel it needs at the outset. Even if it does, the health facilities, whether local or newly established for the occasion, will not be able to meet medical demand without a period of adjustment. Consequently, medical problems will have to be ranked in order of priority to optimize the use of personnel and material resources."
