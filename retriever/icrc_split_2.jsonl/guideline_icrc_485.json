"The best way of resolving this problem is to develop quickly a network of community health workers to take charge of these kinds of ailments. # Screening\nScreening is used for the systematic identification of highpriority medical problems within a population. 16 Thus, the healthcare team may decide to screen for cases of severe malnutrition in order to refer them to nutrition rehabilitation centers. Other pathologies that may be screened for include tuberculosis, measles, malaria, and anemia. The approach is both collective and individual, since the entire population may be examined or merely a specific sector of it (such as children, subjects with fever, etc.). The cases identified by the screening process will be treated, bringing about a short-term reduction in the frequency and incidence of the complaint screened for. Screening differs from triage in that the problems looked for are identified in advance. Screening does not involve choosing from among a group of sick people those who will be given priority in treatment. It also differs from epidemiological investigation, the essential goal of which is to determine the frequency with which a particular medical or health problem appears, usually in a population sample."
