"The ultimate decision must also allow for the constraints of the distributing agency in terms of staff and logistics, with respect to the number of recipients and the time required for the distribution itself. Take-away food rations may be distributed in the form of separate commodities, individual or family parcels, or survival rations and biscuits. Separate food commodities and parcels are preferred. If parcels are chosen, distribution frequency must be discussed in detail beforehand, as this determines their content -once they have been assembled, their content can no longer be changed. Parcels are useful if several commodities (e.g. toiletries) are to be distributed in small amounts. Besides, parcels and separate commodities may be combined: for example, complements, fl avour-enhancing ingredients, and small non-food items can be gathered in parcels, while fl our is distributed from bulk consignments. GFD goods are delivered to the recipients' home, or handed out in central distribution points. In actual fact, home delivery is rare, and is restricted to specifi c cases: examples include attention to small, scattered communities, and the anticipation of security problems for the recipients. Home delivery usually entails no specifi c diffi culty. When distribution is conducted in a central location, the key to its success lies in informing recipients of procedures, and proper organization."
