"provides an indication as to most optimistic and pessimistic results. If among 1,000 subjects, 20% have shown severe wasting, 50% moderate wasting, and 30% an acceptable nutritional status, the 200 missing subjects should fi rst be considered as severely wasted. The adjusted distribution is then 33% severe wasting, 42% moderate wasting, and 25% acceptable nutritional status. The 200 missing subjects are then classifi ed as \"acceptable\", and the adjusted distribution becomes 16% severe wasting, 42% moderate wasting, and 42% acceptable nutritional status. Both distributions are possible, and the situation must be investigated in order to determine whether it results from the absence of subjects (absenteeism)."
