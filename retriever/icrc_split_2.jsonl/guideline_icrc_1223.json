"General aspects during assessment I. Assessment of assessment methods 3.3 Data collection 9 demographic 9 epidemiological 9 ecological and environmental 9 economic 9 social 9 political By virtue of the concept of optimal ignorance, only essential indicators should be selected; it is preferable to add indicators as assessment proceeds and as they are required, rather than wasting time collecting useless information. # DATA COLLECTION\n\n# Targeting preliminary appraisal\nData collection is always targeted. The key to the target is provided by the aggressive phenomena, recognized vulnerabilities and, in the case of preliminary or intermediary assessment, existing harm that corresponds to the warning signals. Preliminary appraisal must defi ne assessment areas and groups that may share the same needs because they face the same problems. Targeting regions and population groups for assessment is derived fi rstly from the warning signals, and later broadens in order to include all regions and groups that face the same risk, or will do so. It may also be useful to collect information from groups that are not exposed to the phenomenon but share similar features to those that are, in order to obtain comparison and reference data with a view to determining normality. The objective is to determine, in an area affected by one or several phenomena, groups and sub-groups that are affected or at risk and show identical characteristics with respect to the crisis. This amounts to identifying groups that are homogenous with respect to the problem and require assistance, working from general identifi cation factors towards specifi c ones:\n9 fi rstly defi ne the geographical regions that are affected by the crisis or the risk of crisis (geographical identifi cation); 9 secondly identify, within these regions, the areas that may present different vulnerabilities (vulnerability identifi cation); 9 thirdly identify, within these areas, the homogenous groups that may present different vulnerabilities because of their different ethnic, economic, social, cultural and political traits, which constitute different risk factors. Each of these groups should be homogenous with respect to the crisis, and thus becomes a specifi c target for assessment. # Obtaining data\nThere are four ways of obtaining the data required to achieve the objectives of assessment:\n9 the review of existing data 9 interviews 9 observation 9 measurement\n\n# General aspects of assessment methods\n\n# Data collection\nThey resort to different sources of information that must be used with the triangulation concept. Prior to assessment, it is important to reiterate the type of information that is sought, how it may and should be obtained, where, and what resources this requires."
