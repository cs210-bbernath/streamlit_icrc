"drought is assumed to determine resilience to drought (working hypothesis). The following categories are increasingly independent with respect to drought: 9 social obligations; 9 pastoralism; 9 agricultural wage-labour; 9 independent agriculture; 9 informal sector; 9 urban wage-labour; 9 crafts; 9 trade. The above provides the basis for the relative vulnerability matrix.  The above simplifi ed matrix does not include such stakeholders as the humanitarian agency involved in the GFD, donors, and third parties that support the war effort. Stakeholders must be analysed in this example according to their relevance to the GFD; necessary negotiation must be undertaken in order to ensure the smooth delivery of the planned food assistance, that is, its acceptance by all stakeholders."
