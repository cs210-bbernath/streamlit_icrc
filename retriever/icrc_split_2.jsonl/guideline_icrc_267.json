"at 150-200 grams gross weight, and 60 grams dry weight. In terms of volume, this is the equivalent of 0.060 m 3 per person. 41 This figure gives an idea of the ''volume'' of the problem, but not necessarily of the size of the system required to dispose of the excreta, especially as other factors are involved -for example, cultural habits and the type of installation used (the main aspect of both these factors being whether or not water is used). In any case, the volume in itself is not a problem; it is the qualitative aspect of waste production that will affect health -that is, the content of the stools."
