However, the following questions must be answered at this stage: The only objective of nutritional information is to change individual behaviour by improving knowledge and motivation. It must not entail a signifi cant increase of expenditure and effort because crisis already complicates the coverage of unavoidable expenditure; crisis also often precludes additional effort on the part of its victims owing to lack of time, fatigue, and other more pressing priorities. Nutritional information can only succeed if behavioural change (which requires little additional investment) is expected to improve the nutritional situation rapidly."
