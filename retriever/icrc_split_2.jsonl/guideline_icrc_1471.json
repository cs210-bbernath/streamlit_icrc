"The catchup component must then be defi ned. If, as indicated above, the catch-up of 1 g of tissue involves the consumption of 5 kcal, and one gram of tissue contains approximately 16% of protein, then 0.2 g of protein must be supplied (of which approximately 80% will be used), in addition to the 5 kcal. Clearly, catch-up ingredients must include both macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients. In terms of macro-nutrients for example, if an adult is to catch up 5 g of weight per kilo and per day, and initially weighs 45 kg, then approximately 1,500 kcal (6,270 kJ) and 34 g of protein for maintenance, plus 1,125 kcal (4,700 kJ) and 45 g of protein for catch-up purposes must be supplied, that is, 2,625 kcal (10,970 kJ) and 79 g of protein in total. In line with the principles defi ned earlier in relation to the setting of rations for planning purposes (15% of the energy supplied in the form of legumes, 20% in oil, and 65% in cereals), rations that supply the calories required for catch-up and maintenance only supply 75 g of protein. Protein is therefore slightly limiting, and catch-up will only reach up to 4.5 g/kg/day."
