"This factor, then, merits a more particular study. # Importance of Vulnerability in the Mechanism of Disasters 2.1 Definition of Vulnerability\nThe study of the different types of vulnerability and its counterpart, the study of the ability to cope with adversity, is very fashionable. In disaster situations, the tendency is to restrict the notion of vulnerability to individuals or groups of individuals, such as children and pregnant women. Of course, the probability (or risk) that these groups will suffer the most has been demonstrated. Nonetheless, to link the emergency to development, the field of vulnerability must be expanded\n\n# Components of a Disaster\nPhenomenon Vulnerability Impact to cover areas that may be less familiar to health-care personnel working in emergencies, but which are fundamental to development. Similarly, a disaster is often very restricted geographically. Accordingly, the local factors reinforcing the initial phenomenon's impact on the vulnerable groups must be sought out. These factors, however, are often linked to national and international structural defects. Although no effort will be made here to link the minutiae of local disturbances to the new world order, it should at least be understood that they are part of a vast and complex whole. ''Vulnerability manifested at the micro level has to be placed within these larger structures and systems, which extend beyond boundaries to the national, regional, and global level. The strategies to deal with vulnerability have therefore to act at several levels -the local level, of the community and the households within it, the national level (in terms of sectoral and macroeconomic policies), and the global level (in terms of international policies and programmes relating to aid, technical assistance, and economic relations between countries).'' 27 The publication of several works on the subject 28 and the United Nations' declaration of ''The International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction'' have greatly helped to popularize the issue. They establish an important link between emergency relief and development activities. That is why this section focuses on the reduction of vulnerability as an example of development. # Types of Vulnerability\nThere are several kinds of vulnerability, as shown previously in the conceptual framework of development (section I-7). # Ecological Vulnerability\nEcological vulnerability is usually a secondary effect of the combination of primary geophysical phenomena and a particular social behavior. Heavy rainfall in densely populated rural zones with a high degree of deforestation will give rise to disasters which develop slowly (erosion) or abruptly (landslides). # Economic Vulnerability\nThe economic system is particularly vulnerable in developing countries."
