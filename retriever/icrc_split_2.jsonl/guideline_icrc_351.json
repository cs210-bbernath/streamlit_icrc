"Who will decide on possible contraindications? # Evaluation of an Immunization Program\n\n# Evaluation of Activities\nThe measures taken should be evaluated. Note should be taken, for example, of the number of children immunized in a day, and the number of vaccine doses used; similarly, the temperature charts used throughout the cold chain must be monitored. # Evaluation of Immunization Coverage\nImmunization coverage corresponds to the ratio between the number of subjects immunized and the number of subjects in the target group defined at the beginning of the immunization campaign. # Evaluation of Vaccination Effectiveness\nIt is difficult to measure the rate of seroconversion in an emergency situation. Instead, epidemiological evaluations should be made, based on the number of subjects immunized who develop the disease in relation to the number of nonimmunized subjects who develop the disease."
