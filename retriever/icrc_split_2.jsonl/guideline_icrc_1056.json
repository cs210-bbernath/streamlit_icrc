"-and ask the following question: Can war be prevented ? To prevent war, the fundamental causes of tension and underlying violence must be analyzed. We know that, although these causes are sometimes rooted in territorial claims, they are primarily:\n. socio-economic inequalities . cultural and religious intolerance . \n# ethnic discrimination\nThese problems can be solved through development, the word ''development'' being used here in its broadest sense, that is to say, including reduction of poverty, elimination of all forms of discrimination and promotion of tolerance. Humanitarian action in behalf of the victims of armed conflicts also helps to promote peace, by maintaining in the midst of war a humanitarian enclave of dialogue and understanding between the parties which in some cases can serve as a starting-point for the resumption of the peace process."
