"39 . # Lack of organizational skills\nThis problem involves essentially a lack of the skills needed to manage problems created by a sudden surge in demand, where resources are sufficient in quantityfor example, the organization of a hospital to cope with an influx of casualties, 40 or the management of logistical resources. The presence of WHO experts in national ministries answers this need. # Organizing the Puzzle of Programs into a Coherent System\nThe health system may be artificial (constructed entirely for the conflict situation), or the emergency programs may be integrated in the normal system, replacing missing or inoperative components of the existing system. The latter strategy may be a step towards DEVELOPMENT. # V. Integrating Emergency Programs in a Health-Care System\nAid consisting in the provision of equipment, personnel, or logistic resources is integrated into the local health-care system. However, if the local system is unable to cope with the situation and external aid programs are necessary, they must somehow be integrated into a system, whether the local one or a parallel one created specifically for the emergency situation. 42 The implementation of aid programs that are not integrated into some kind of comprehensive system is apt to result in ineffectiveness due to the absence of longterm follow-up and the lack of coherence between the different programs. Increasingly, humanitarian relief must take into account the capacities of the local facilities and their desire to manage crisis situations themselves."
