"forced to intervene according to criteria unrelated to their mandates. \n# Competition\nSeveral agencies work in the same field and find themselves in competition with each other. Each will try to do better than the others. The competition is even fiercer if the field involved is one with public impact -that is, one that generates resources.

In a given situation, this competition between identical programs (nutritional rehabilitation, medical care) leads to genuine anarchy and a waste of resources. \n# Contest\nA contest is a form of competition, cultivated as a sport."
