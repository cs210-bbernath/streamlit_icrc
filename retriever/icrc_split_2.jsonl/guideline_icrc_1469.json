"all go unnoticed, and results must be verifi ed accordingly. \n# APPRAISING FOOD CONSUMPTION\nThe examination of food consumption permits the quantitative and qualitative defi nition of what people eat. It provides information as to dietary adequacy and food sources. As is done for production activities, what is normally eaten must be established fi rst, and how it is usually prepared. Qualitatively, this amounts to eating habits. Then the situation at the moment of assessment must be defi ned for the sake of comparison. It is usually not possible to observe absolutely everything the household eats over a given period; sampling however produces reliable results."
