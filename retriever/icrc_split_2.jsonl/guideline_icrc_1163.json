"(in the order of only 500 mg) can erode quickly. \n# Dietary defi ciency\nIn adults, the diet is rarely iron defi cient in quantitative terms, but may be in qualitative terms, because the iron contained in foods is in a form that is diffi cult to assimilate. On the other hand, premature and/or low birth weight (< 2.5 kg) infants frequently develop anaemia through dietary defi ciency because their iron status is weak, and cannot be compensated by maternal milk; in parallel, growth requirements are signifi cant (the amount of iron in the organism must double within the fi rst year)."
