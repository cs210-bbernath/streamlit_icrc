"a) Physical or geographical inaccessibility: The health-care services are too far away from the displaced population; there are no means of transport. This kind of problem is not specific to emergency situations; rural populations are usually very far away from health-care facilities. b) Financial inaccessibility: Civilians wounded in the course of a conflict, for example, may not have the money to pay the hospital, even though the latter has the capacity to treat them. c) Social inaccessibility: This may be exacerbated by the increased demand during a crisis; the most deprived social classes may be denied access to healthcare facilities. d) Political inaccessibility: This is very specific to conflict situations. Discrimination may be based on various factors, such as membership in a political party, an armed band, or an ethnic group. In addition, security problems keep victims from reaching health-care facilities, or preventive programs (immunization, mosquito-control programs, etc.) from reaching certain regions. e) A combination of different kinds of inaccessibility: The displacement of populations to a region far removed from any medical infrastructure because of their political, ethnic, or other affiliations exemplifies a combination of geographic, financial, and political factors. A certain number of decisions must already be made at this stage, depending on whether the inaccessibility can be reduced or not:\n-Can the displaced population be returned home? -Is it possible to negotiate non-discriminatory health care for all the victims of a conflict, whatever their political affiliation? -Is it possible to negotiate free access to health services for the disaster victims? When problems cannot be resolved by local means, external aid 24 must be contemplated in the form of:\n. financial aid, to give victims access to the local health-care services;\n. ICRC protection, to preserve the local health-care services' access to the populations they serve; 25 . making a hospital neutral ground, in order to guarantee safe access to it; 26 . establishing parallel facilities to take the place of the local services."
