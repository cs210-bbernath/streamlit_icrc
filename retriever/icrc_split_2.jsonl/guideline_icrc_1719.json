"populations are not homogeneous in terms of access to food. It may be necessary to target groups that are especially vulnerable or, where this is not possible, to set ration levels that satisfy the need for assistance as effectively as possible. This however implies that some will receive too much, and others too little; the latter may require additional safety measures such as the establishment of supplementary and therapeutic feeding centres in order to treat moderate and severe malnutrition. 9 Coping mechanisms and the economic potential of available resources can be diffi cult to appraise, and may be unclear if target groups are still at the stage of exploring available opportunities."
