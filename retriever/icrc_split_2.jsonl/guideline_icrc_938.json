"It is also prohibited to destroy objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population. And as we have already seen, forced displacements are expressly prohibited (Art. 17, Protocol II). In general, civilians are to be treated humanely. The internally displaced are also entitled to receive assistance. Displaced persons are often very vulnerable, in particular when they are in the power of an authority which is not in a position or does not wish to assume responsibility for their protection. The number of displaced persons has risen sharply in recent years. They now number more than refugees. There is every reason for the international community to show concern for their plight, but not at the expense of other categories of victims whose need for protection and assistance is often just as great. # Prevention of Population Displacements\nIn this context, the word ''prevention'' means the possibilities of guarding against a situation where a population will be obliged to flee its usual place of abode for reasons of security. International humanitarian law contains the necessary provisions to protect civilian populations, and compliance with it should save them from having to flee during an armed conflict. Prevention at this level, then, means insuring that international humanitarian law is applied. 37\nPopulations displaced within the boundaries of the national territory are protected as conflict victims by humanitarian law, in particular Article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949. Population displacements in the context of an ethnic cleansing policy constitute an extremely serious violation of international humanitarian law. The ICRC plays an essential role in guaranteeing the protection of these populations."
