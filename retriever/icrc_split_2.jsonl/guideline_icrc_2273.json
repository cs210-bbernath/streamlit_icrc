"quickly contaminated by the pathogens that thrive in a TFC. In the tropics especially, milk grows dangerous within an hour following its reconstitution, whatever the accompanying precautions. Porridge is more resistant because it inhibits bacterial propagation, but it is nevertheless a sound culture medium and must be consumed without delay, within 2 hours following its preparation. Normal meals are even more resistant than porridge. The risk of contamination exists nonetheless, and they must therefore also be eaten soon after preparation. Leftovers must be distributed in supplements to benefi ciaries who are still hungry or carers, or disposed of. The fundamental rule in a TFC is that leftovers must never be served again at the following meal."
