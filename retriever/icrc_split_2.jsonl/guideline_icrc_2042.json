"9 Latrines and ablution booths for the staff and for the benefi ciaries and their carers; such facilities must be equipped with waste water disposal systems. TFC facilities must be organized according to their function and grouped according to their use, in order to facilitate the work:\n9 group 1: patient admission and examination; 9 group 2 : intensive care unit, rehydration unit, medical unit, examination and treatment room, pharmacy, and laboratory; 9 group 3: kitchen, food storage, water points, and canteen; 9 group 4: administration, and material storage; 9 group 5: habitat; 9 group 6: ablutions and showers; 9 group 7: latrines, waste disposal, and incineration. The safest and most comfortable location must be found for ablution/shower points, latrines, incineration (according to prevailing winds), waste storage and waste water evacuation. # Water and sanitation\n\n# Access to water\n\n# Preliminary remarks\nThe setting up of water supply systems (especially for drinking water) requires technical skills that are often beyond those of the health staff running a TFC; this is particularly true because access to water varies signifi cantly from location to location. The general rule is that all matters pertaining to water and sanitation in a TFC should be addressed by water and environmental engineers or technicians. Beyond that, the major points pertaining to water access justify a reminder here. Whatever the magnitude and seriousness of severe malnutrition, the absolute pre-condition for the setting up of a TFC is regular and suffi cient access to safe water. Possible options include natural water points (such as springs, watercourses, and ground water) and artifi cial points (wells and reticulation networks, but the latter are exceedingly rare)."
