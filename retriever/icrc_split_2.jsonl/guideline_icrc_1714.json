"In other words, severe dehydration may be totally unrelated to diarrhoea or septic shock. # Preventing dehydration\nThe prevention of dehydration during initial treatment consists in administering rehydration solutions in order to compensate excessive loss due to diarrhoea and sometimes vomiting. In the absence of these two symptoms, patients must be made to drink regularly, through breastfeeding, fl uid reanimation feeding, and drinking water. # Treating dehydration\nDiarrhoea that combines with severe malnutrition causes substantial electrolyte and mineral imbalance; its treatment is therefore different from that recommended for diarrhoea that is unrelated to malnutrition. 1."
