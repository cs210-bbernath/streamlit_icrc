"NG tube, at the rate indicated in Table 13.3 above. Rehydration is completed when the patient is no longer thirsty and passes urine. The possibility of over-hydration nevertheless warrants special attention: its signs are an increased respiratory rate, engorged jugular veins, or a distended abdomen. Over-hydration calls for the immediate suspension of the treatment. ReSoMal given to maintain hydration in the case of persisting diarrhoea must be administered in amounts that are equivalent to the volume of the stool, until diarrhoea stops. In case of persisting vomiting, ReSoMal must be administered by NG tube. As soon as the patient becomes alert and is willing to drink, larger amounts of ReSoMal may be administered, but at longer intervals: this is in order to avoid vomiting and an undue acceleration of the overall rehydration rate."
