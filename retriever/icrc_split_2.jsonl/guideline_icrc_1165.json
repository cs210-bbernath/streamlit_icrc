"from animal sources is generally better absorbed than vegetable iron. Moreover, non-anaemic subjects only absorb approximately 10% of the iron contained in their food, whereas anaemic subjects tend to absorb the double, that is, 20%. Iron from animal sources increases the absorption of vegetable iron -in other words, even low dietary contents of animal origin result in a considerably better overall iron absorption than identical amounts of animal and vegetable iron, but ingested during well separated meals. Iron absorption is inhibited by the phytates and tannins that are sometimes found in large concentrations in cereals and legumes. It is also inhibited by calcium (a glass of milk drunk during the meal reduces iron absorption by half), and phosphorus."
