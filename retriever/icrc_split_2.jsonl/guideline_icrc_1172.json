"12 g/dl for children between 7 and 14 years old. \n# Treatment\nBecause of the weak absorption of dietary iron, the recommended treatment is the administration of iron tablets, usually combined with folic acid. If, however, the anaemia results from vitamin B 12 defi ciency, then this vitamin must also be administered. The treatment of anaemia resulting from iron defi ciency corrects haemoglobin imbalance within 3 to 4 months, but therapy must last for 6 to 12 months to ensure that iron reserves have been reconstituted. The treatment dosage for adults is 300 mg of ferrous sulphate twice daily, between meals."
