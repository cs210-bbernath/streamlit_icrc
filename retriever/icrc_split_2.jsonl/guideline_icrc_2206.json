"to satisfy protein requirements, provided that energy requirements are met. The P/E% ratio of cereals is approximately 11%, that of legumes at least 23%. Practically then, a ration that supplies 65% of its energy in cereals, 20% in oil, and 15% in legumes amounts to a P/E% of 11.5%. If the ration supplies 20% of its energy in the form of oil, and the remainder in cereals only (i.e. to the exclusion of legumes), the P/E% drops to 9% or below. The proportion of legumes to be included in order to cover protein requirements must always be 10 to 15% of the overall energy supply."
