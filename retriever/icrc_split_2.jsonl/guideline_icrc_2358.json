"too sensitive to determine moderate, and especially severe, malnutrition accurately. For example, for a child measuring 92 cm, the -2 Z-scores threshold is 13.9 cm, the -3 Z-scores threshold is 12.8 cm. The corresponding values for 85% and 75% of the median are 13.9 and 12.2 respectively according to de Ville de Goyet. Sensitivity grows with height, causing an increasing specifi city loss. On the other hand, the combination of MUAC-for-age tables (WHO, 1995) and height-for-age tables (WHO, 1983) supplies MUAC-for-age and MUAC-for-height values with the standard deviation of MUAC-for-age. The -2 Z-scores threshold is more specifi c than 85% of the median values used by de Ville de Goyet; the -3 Z-scores threshold is roughly identical to 75% of these median values."
