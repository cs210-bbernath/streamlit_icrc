"combination with wet feeding (i.e. the supply of prepared meals). \n# Supplying basic rations that permit their exchange for complementary foods\nThis approach is the most practical for humanitarian agencies, which thereby transfer the search for complementary foods to recipients. However it provides no guarantee that recipients will indeed satisfy their micro-nutrient requirements. Economic priorities usually take precedence over nutritional concerns when the amount of food is more or less suffi cient to satiate hunger. In the absence of nutritional knowledge, specifi c defi ciencies are unfortunately often overlooked, and clinical symptoms are not connected to dietary disorders in time."
