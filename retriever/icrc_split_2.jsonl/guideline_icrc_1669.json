"Breastfeeding is a major priority for infants, and there is no excuse for suspending it, even at mealtimes in the TFC. Moreover, mothers should be actively encouraged and helped to breastfeed in all circumstances, and as long as possible (at least until the child is 2 years old). TFC provide an ideal setting to deliver training on weaning practices, allowing for local customs and food availability."
