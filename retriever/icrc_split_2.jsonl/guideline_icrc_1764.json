"During famines, domestic weaning food is prepared with basic GFD foods, which must be familiar to all TFC children during their sojourn to limit relapse following their discharge. # Criteria for the transition to a normal diet\nIn principle, nutritional rehabilitation is achieved when the patient's nutritional status meets the following criteria:\n9 weight-for-height index equal to or greater than -1 Z-score or 90%; or 9 MUAC-for-height index equal to or greater than -2 Z-scores or 85%. At this stage, most children will have substantially reduced their food intake, as their catch-up capacity is saturated. However, depending on the urgency resulting from the potential number of benefi ciaries, and provided that food access at home is adequate, nutritional rehabilitation may be terminated as soon as the patient's nutritional status exceeds the criteria for moderate malnutrition according to the weight-for-height index, or 80% of the MUAC-for-height index. This option is recommended during famines. If the potential number of benefi ciaries is high (and provided that access to food at home is adequate), rehabilitation may also be terminated as soon as the patients' nutritional status exceeds the criteria for severe malnutrition and their medical disorders are treated; such patients are then transferred to Supplementary Feeding Programme (SFP) centres. 39 This option however increases the risk of relapse, and slows down the catch-up process. # ADDITIONAL ASPECTS OF INITIAL TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION\n\n# Breastfeeding\nBreastfeeding is an absolute priority in the treatment of severe malnutrition, and every effort must be made to encourage or restore it. 40 The importance of breastfeeding is even greater in a TFC because maternal milk is the best possible infant food: it protects against infection (which is often rampant in a TFC), and plays a fundamental role in the emotional balance of infants, which is usually upset by their living conditions and malnutrition. # Infant diet in a TFC\nIf a wet nurse cannot be found, orphans who have lost their mother cannot breastfeed. In such circumstances, readers are referred to the recommendations made in Chapter XV, Section 6.2.1 regarding alternatives to breastfeeding."
