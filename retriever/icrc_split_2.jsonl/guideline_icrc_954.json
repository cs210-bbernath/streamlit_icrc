"dangerous and the populations should be evacuated? Logically, efforts should not be made to maintain populations in their normal environment if they are in danger there; instead, they should be helped to seek refuge elsewhere. The ethical problem becomes complex, however, when the insecurity is a policy intentionally pursued by one of the parties to the conflict precisely in order to force the population to leave home. In a situation of this kind, it is reasonable to help these residents to remain where they are, if that is what they want. However, humanitarian agencies face an ethical dilemma in the case of populations that want to leave. If they help them leave, they are lending themselves to the purge policy of one of the parties to the conflict; if they try to keep them in their homes, they are exposing them to danger. # Evaluating the impact of each strategy on international humanitarian law violations for all categories of victims\n\n# Impartiality of Humanitarian Aid\nThe concept of impartiality is often misunderstood by the parties to a conflict. Assisting victims in the territory of the enemy is considered as support for the enemy's war effort rather than a humanitarian act. # Proportionality of Needs\nFrom the ethical point of view, humanitarian relief should be adapted to needs. This means that in a situation involving victims on both sides, but with more needs on one side than the other, more aid will be given where the need is greater. The authorities concerned may see this disparity as unjust if, for example, they have the ''misfortune'' to have fewer victims or needs in the territory they control, or if they are better organized than the enemy to supply the needs -partially or totally -of the victims who depend on them. Thus, the authorities who discharge their obligations properly may feel penalized in comparison with the enemy, whose victims, abandoned, will be taken care of by the humanitarian organizations. This is why, in order to attract humanitarian aid, authorities often inflate or even invent statistics concerning the number of victims, or else claim that the local facilities are unable to meet the needs of the population.
