"responsibility. The criteria for replacement might be the following: . discriminatory access to services;\n. practices dangerous for victims;\n. external presence necessitated by insecurity;\n. urgency of an effective intervention. The replacement strategy also solves another problem -that of neutrality, when there is a risk that one party to the conflict will consider humanitarian aid to the facilities of the other party as evidence that the humanitarian intervention is not neutral. Despite its advantages, replacement strategy must be limited to those situations where the local facilities do not meet the criteria of neutrality and efficiency called for by an emergency situation."
