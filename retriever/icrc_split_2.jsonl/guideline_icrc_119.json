Rank the problems in approximate order of severity (the most severe first). Note whether each problem is \"normal\" or \"new\". A normal problem is one that happens every year (e.g. a \"hunger period\" before the harvest). A new problem is one that has resulted from the current emergency (e.g. contamination of water supplies after floods). For \"normal\" problems, note how often the problem occurs (e.g. once a year or once every three years)."
