"An elevated concentration of salts (chlorides, sulfates) leads to few health problems, since beyond a certain level the water's salty taste deters people from drinking it. 8 Where chemical contamination presents a danger to health, the only solution is to seek another water-supply source. # Physical Quality\nPhysical quality concerns the physical attributes of the water, namely taste, smell, and appearance. Water which appears turbid is not necessarily unfit for consumption, if microbiological and chemical criteria are met; but the potential consumers may be disinclined to drink ''dirty'' water. ''The most specific of the readily detectable faecal indicators of bacteria and the one present in greatest numbers of faeces is Escherichia coli, and it is therefore recommended as the indicator of choice for drinking water.''
