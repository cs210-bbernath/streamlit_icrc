"General aspects I. Assessment of assessment methods 3.4 Selecting subjects\nOnce the intended accuracy is determined for a 5% sampling error and that expected prevalence rates have been set, sample size \"n\" may be calculated based on the following formula: -----d 2\np \u00d7 q n = \u03b5 2 \u00d7 -\nWhere: n = the number of subjects in the sample \u03b5 = 1.96, the factor determining the sampling error at 5% p = the expected prevalence rate, say 20% q = 100 -p d = the required accuracy expressed in \u00b1 d%, say \u00b1 5%\nThe resulting equation for this example is then as follows:\n20 \u00d7 (100-20) n = 1.96 2 \u00d7 ----------------= 246 5 2 If the sampling error is reduced to 1%, then \u03b5 equals 2.576 and, consequently, the sample size \"n\" rises to 425. Similarly, if accuracy is increased to \u00b1 3%, for a 5% sampling error, the sample size rises to 683. Finally, if the prevalence rate cannot be estimated and is therefore arbitrarily set at 50% to minimize the risk of inaccuracy, the sample size for a 5% sampling error and a \u00b1 5% accuracy is 384. Generally speaking, the lower the sampling error, the smaller the confi dence interval and the closer the expected prevalence lies to 50%, the larger the sample is. Usually, the expected prevalence rate and the sampling error cannot be adjusted in order to reduce sample size; however the intended accuracy can be reduced, provided that this still produces results that are relevant to operations, that is, that permit decision-making. Intended accuracy has the greatest impact on sample size. Correction for small populations Population size does not in principle infl uence sample size. However, in small populations, a correction factor may be used. A small population is one in which the sample \"n\" as calculated above exceeds 10% of the total population \"N\". In such cases, the corrected sample is calculated as follows:\ncorrected n = n /  Referring to the above example: n = 246 N = the total population, say 2,000 subjects In this example, the sample size is reduced by 11%. Had the total population been 1,000 subjects, the corrected sample size would be 197 subjects, that is, a 20% reduction in sample size. Sample size for systematic random sampling, and for each unit in stratifi ed sampling, is calculated in the same way as for simple random sampling. # General aspects of assessment methods\n3.4 Selecting subjects Cluster random sampling Sample size is calculated in the same way as simple random sampling, but the greater uncertainty, and the inevitable heterogeneity associated with clusters must be allowed for. The formula is therefore completed with a \"c\" cluster factor, which increases sample size in order to preserve the degree of accuracy. Experience shows that a factor of 2 (c = 2) is usually suffi cient: doubling the sample size obtained through the simple sampling formula adequately allows for the cluster effect. The adapted formula is as follows:\np \u00d7 q n = \u03b5 2 \u00d7 c \u00d7 ------- d 2\nWhere the cluster factor c = 2. In the case of cluster sampling intended to determine the experimental value of a prevalence rate expected to be of 20%, the sample size is the following: The number of clusters must then be determined: for example, 10 clusters amount to 49.2 subjects per cluster. The number of subjects per cluster must then be rounded up, preferably upwards to increase accuracy, in this case 50."
