"overall functioning of a health-care system is judged by: . the coordination between the services offered and the needs of the population;\n. the equitable distribution of services;\n. the accessibility of care. Basic interventions to cover physiological needs: for example, the provision of food and water will keep most of the victims alive\n\n# An Approach to Constructing a Health-Care System\nThe construction of a health-care system must permit authorities to deal with the most urgent needs\nA health-care system should be constructed so that basic needs can be covered first Construction of a health-care system in a situation of armed conflict must take into consideration the presence of urgent needs situated at both ends of the pyramid\nThese three criteria are also valid for emergency situations -with, however, variable connotations."
