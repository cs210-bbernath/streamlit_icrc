"Similarly, doctors and nurses, besides the care they provide, play an organizational role in dispensaries and hospitals, and, in some cases, directly in the community. 2 Such care includes health education, personal hygiene, introduction to prophylactic measures (immunization), guided weaning, family-planning advice, treatment of diarrhea, management of a family medicine chest, introduction to health services, etc. 3 This level involves health-related activities that can be undertaken at the family level but extend beyond the framework of individual health due to factors such as environmental hygiene, water supply, food production, the organization of immunization campaigns, etc. The financial and technological resources allocated to a health-care system shape its activities. If, in a disaster-stricken country, hospitals and the training of highlevel medical personnel are given priority, to the detriment of the grassroots levels (dispensaries, community, family), the result will be essentially a European type of health-care system. Balancing the distribution of financial and human resources between primary health-care (PHC) programs and medical-care programs in health-care facilities should be the ultimate goal, so that everyone has access to the care he or she requires, regardless of social class. In conflict situations, access to medical care must not be allowed to depend on political, ethnic, or military affiliations."
