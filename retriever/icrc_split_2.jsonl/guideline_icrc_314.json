"it is unequally distributed among the members of the population. In the case of malaria, for example, the mortality rate in endemic regions is very high during the first two years of life. In groups from non-endemic areas who move into endemic regions, all individuals run the risk of developing severe forms of malaria. Besides the risks attributable to a new pathogenic agent, a certain number of other factors help modify the mosaic of a population's natural immunity. A change in the make-up of the population, such as a relative rise in the percentage of children, 5 proportionately increases the number of people sensitive to infectious agents."
