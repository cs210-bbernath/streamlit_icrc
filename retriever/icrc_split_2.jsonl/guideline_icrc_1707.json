"biscuits and the canned meat that are rich in lipids. Other combinations, based upon Tables 12. 4 and 12.5, may be devised to accommodate constraints and opportunities. The energy and protein value of rations indicated in Table 12.5 is calculated from the average value of relevant food groups. In practice, the energy and protein value is adjusted according to the foodstuffs that are actually selected for inclusion; however their amounts must not be changed in order to reach equivalent calorie values. For example, if ration 2 provides the reference, 400 g of cereal are included, be it maize or rice, and the amounts of other ration components are not changed either, even if the energy and protein content of the resulting ration is slightly different."
