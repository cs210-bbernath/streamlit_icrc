"failure without the direct participation of local authorities and society. Their support is actively sought. \n# Interaction with local associations\nUsually neglected, again because of the emergency, and because relief workers usually lack the skills and inclination to cooperate with local associations. The rule, because development must be anchored in local structures for success. Pirotte and Husson use the above observation of the dichotomy between emergency and development as the basis for their healthy questioning of the approach to emergency, as defi ned above, which refl ects biases that are detrimental to so-called emergency relief. This Manual agrees with these authors: humanitarian action cannot and must not shy away from understanding events that precede and follow acute crisis, or the society that provides the setting for a given crisis."
