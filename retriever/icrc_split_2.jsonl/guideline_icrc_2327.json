"more than one hour, unless they are refrigerated below 4\u00b0C. \n# Quality attention and healthcare\nDuring the weaning process, infants need much attention and require appropriate care quickly if infections appear. Furthermore, they should be regularly treated for parasites and vaccinated against infant diseases; these especially include measles and whooping cough, but also other dangerous infections such as poliomyelitis, diphtheria, and tetanus. Attention and healthcare are the two complements of feeding. Children suffering from infection must continue to be fed and hydrated, even and above all if their condition involves vomiting or diarrhoea. The child must be given the means to fi ght infection with the food it consumes regularly rather than with its reserves."
