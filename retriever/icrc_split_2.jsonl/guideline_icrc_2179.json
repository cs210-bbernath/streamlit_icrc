Drawbacks: weight is infl uenced by variables that may alter the interpretation of results; weight is not always easily measured (see above, weight-for-age); it requires that two measurements be accurately recorded, which is not easy, and the participation of two persons; measurements are timeconsuming, as is data processing (unless results are entered into a specifi c computer programme such as EPINUT, which is also time-consuming and introduces the risk of mistakes associated with the transcription of data)."
