"On one hand, there is the importance of instituting flexible mechanisms for consultation which do not slow down the decision-making process and which do not complicate life for those working in the field. Indeed, the particular characteristics of each conflict make it impossible to contemplate instituting rigid procedures expected to work in all interventions. On the other hand, and more important in my opinion, is the necessity of developing principles of action to make partners h i p s c o m p a t i b l e w h i l e preserving the impartial character of every authentically humanitarian action. In this respect, it might be useful to define a common framework of ethical and operational principles for the use of numerous non-governmental organizations whose actions are not defined by Conventions or by clearly specified mandates recognized by the international community.'' 14 \n\n# Inter-Agency Conferring and the Planning Process\n\n# III. Humanitarian Organizations\nTo understand the possibilities of consultation, coordination, and cooperation between the different humanitarian agencies, we must be familiar with the characteristics of each. This section briefly describes the mandate and the modus operandi of the humanitarian organizations most involved in the health field and in situations of armed conflict. Each example is representative of a certain type of humanitarian organization. # The International Red\nCross and Red Crescent Movement\nThe International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement comprises all the recognized National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (which is their central secretariat), and the ICRC. The activities of the Movement's components are described in the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Moreover, a 1989 agreement between the ICRC and the International Federation specifies which tasks fall to which institution. Thus, the ICRC has the lead role in the Movement's international activities in armed conflicts and other situations requiring the presence of a specifically neutral and independent organization, whereas the Federation coordinates the relief efforts of the National Societies in the wake of major disasters. These rules make the Movement more efficient and strengthen its unity."
