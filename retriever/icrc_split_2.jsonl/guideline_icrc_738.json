"-and early signs of natural disasters, such as the results of seismological, volcanic, and hydrological surveillance. However, trials of EWSs have been confined mostly to drought prediction, for the following reasons. # Ease of Prediction\nDroughts are easy to predict compared with disasters that develop extremely quickly, such as earthquakes and cyclones. There are two reasons for this. First, droughts develop slowly, allowing time (theoretically) to take preventive measures in case of alert. Second, the indicators that permit observers to predict a drought, or at least its initial consequences for a population (migration) and the economy (market prices), are relatively simple and reliable. # Seriousness\nDrought is very serious for a population. Of course, a drought does not appear to kill as many people as the immediate effects of an earthquake, since it is a slowly developing phenomenon which does not have the suddenness of an earthquake. The death rates per 10,000 people affected by an earthquake or a drought are, respectively, 150 and 8. 75 Nonetheless, of all the disasters, drought is in first place due to the size of the populations affected 76 and the mortality associated with it (the number of deaths is often underestimated). # EWSs in Drought-Prone Areas\nThe Choice of Indicators\nThe choice of indicators depends on the probable causes of drought. Although these indicators are interwoven in a complex manner, a certain hierarchy among them can be established, based not on their power to precipitate the problem, but on their capacity to reflect the seriousness of the situation."
