"''There are few situations in which the individual encounters greater dangers than in war. And it is in a situation of war that the individual is also the most vulnerable.'' 6 5 ''The ICRC is firmly of the opinion that the only effective measure is to ban the use and production of anti-personnel landmines. also of the opinion that there should be strict controls on the use and design of anti-vehicle mines which in practice have led to casualties among both local civilian and humanitarian workers, including ICRC delegates, who need to use the roads to reach the victims. The ICRC notes with satisfaction that several States have joined the call for a ban on anti-personnel mines and earnestly hopes that others will do so before the Review Conference itself.'' Statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (24 Oct. 1994) Civilian populations suffer in particular in situations of armed conflict; forced displacement, extortion, and assault are all frequent violations of international humanitarian law."
