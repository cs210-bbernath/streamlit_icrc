Ibid. This course will use the WHO definition, which tends to equate supplementary feeding with the food that must be supplied to vulnerable groups to cover specific qualitative nutritional needs not covered by the standard basic ration. On the practical level, the trend is increasingly to supply a supplement to the basic ration distributed to families, consisting of foods chosen to compensate for the specific deficiencies of the basic ration. The resulting increase in the basic ration is essentially intended to respond to the specific nutritional needs of the vulnerable groups, rather than the general quantitative needs of the family. # Rations\nNormally a supplementary ration is supposed to provide approximately 350 kcal and 10-15 grams of protein per day per person in the vulnerable category. The choice of foods for this ration depends mainly on the strategy used in implementing the program. There are two possible options:\n-distributing dry supplementary rations to vulnerable groups, in addition to the basic ration; -feeding vulnerable groups a meal equivalent to the supplementary ration. In the first case, the foods chosen must meet two kinds of criteria: they must be technically suitable for general distribution (perishability, transport, storage) and they must satisfy the nutritional needs of the beneficiaries. Usually supplementary feeding consists in increasing the proportion of legumes and fats already contained in the basic ration, bringing it to a total of 2,500 kcal and 70-75 grams of protein. In the second case, more specific foods can be used, such as powdered milk, eggs, etc. These foods are prepared at the feeding center and consumed there by all the vulnerable groups in the form of a daily meal. # Practical Organization\nThe organization of supplementary feeding has undergone major changes over the last ten years. At the beginning of the 1980s, the tendency in supplementary feeding was to provide meals at centers constructed specially for that purpose. Various comparative studies on the subject, however, have led to a reconsideration of this method, since the integration of the supplementary energy and protein in the basic ration appears to be preferable to the traditional approach to supplementary feeding. 68 The creation of feeding centers also tends to disrupt family life by forcing mothers to go to the centers every day, leaving at home those of their children who are not classified as vulnerable. This is why attendance at such centers is usually sparse. The same study cited above also recommended reinforcing the basic ration, stating that the provision of an adequate basic ration should remain the priority, and that the current emphasis on supplementary feeding programs was in fact a response to the inadequacies of general distribution programs. 69 With certain exceptions, today's tendency is to provide supplementary feeding for vulnerable groups by reinforcing the basic ration. The logistical problems involved in setting up a supplementary feeding program are the same as for general food distribution. # Surveillance\nEssentially, relief agencies measure the impact of a supplementary feeding program by monitoring the nutritional status of the groups benefiting from it. In emergency situations, it is difficult to differentiate between the results of the supplementary feeding program itself and the impact of concurrent measures, such as an improved water supply and better access to health services."
