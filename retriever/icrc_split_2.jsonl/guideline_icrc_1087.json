"Great is the temptation to be in the picture at all costs, even if the resulting haste is soon followed by panic. Moreover, emergency provides the perfect excuse to do just about anything and then catch the fi rst train out, without further thought or planning. By the time this becomes obvious, it is usually too late to correct initial mistakes and, in confl ict, great security risks can result, as observed alas all too often. Assessment is particularly penalized by the emergency syndrome, because it is not spectacular, and costs time, money, and human resources; furthermore, a widespread and pernicious idea holds that needs are self-evident in emergencies, and that \"there is no need to think to know what must be done\". Seen as a waste of time, serious assessment is replaced by \"rapid appraisals\" that are botched up, or even neglected altogether. It is worth noting that the authorities of crisis-stricken areas often clamour for the quick delivery of relief; this is sometimes motivated by their sound knowledge of how to take advantage of the initial chaos in order to divert assistance. This Manual insists on the need for appropriate assessment prior to deciding upon any type of operation, and to resist the pressure of politics, amateurism, profi t, and visibility."
