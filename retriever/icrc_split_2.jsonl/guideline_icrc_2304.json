"by addressing issues that are only of indirect economic relevance. \n# CONVEYING NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION\n\n# DEMONSTRATING THE RELEVANCE OF NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION\nIn a crisis especially, nutritional information programmes must be supported by survey data that clearly demonstrates their relevance and pertinence. This may be achieved in two ways. A causal model can be designed from all cases that present a given pathology, by backtracking to the causes of this pathology, and demonstrating that they can be resolved through information. Alternatively, local nutritional and care practices can be compared with recommended procedures, and possible discrepancies then investigated in order to determine whether the local practice is harmful or not."
