"56 In such cases, there are two options:\n. institute a surveillance system in order to detect future problems;\n. undertake preemptive measures to prevent the crisis from worsening. 57 The principle of preventive interventions is difficult to promote; the international community rarely mobilizes to intervene in situations that have not yet produced their quota of horrors, and the leaders of humanitarian organizations hesitate to commit themselves to relief operations that may later prove to have been unnecessary. To facilitate the decision-making process, organizations tend to adopt specific quantitative criteria for intervention, such as a death rate higher than 2/10,000 per day or a malnutrition rate that is considerably higher than normal. These parameters define situations that are already much deteriorated and that urgently require intervention. Clearly, however, organizations should not wait until health status has reached this point; far better to intervene with preventive measures when mortality and malnutrition levels are still within acceptable limits. Timely intervention costs much less than resorting to emergency air transport, purchases made under pressure without the opportunity to issue tenders, etc. Humanitarian organizations should base their decisions on common sense rather than precise intervention criteria, and accept the necessity of making risky decisions. Finally, every assessment arouses in the population involved expectations of some kind of assistance."
