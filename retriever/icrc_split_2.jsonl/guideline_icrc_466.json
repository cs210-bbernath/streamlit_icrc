"This chapter covers medical and surgical care in emergency situations. Discussion is limited to the management of medicalsurgical programs, without going into precise details regarding the diagnosis and treatment of each medical problem that may come up in this kind of situation. For greater clarity, a distinction is made between general care for displaced populations and surgical care for war-wounded. \n# I. Medical Care for Displaced Populations\n\n# Introduction\nMedical care for displaced populations can be defined as the interaction between a patient with a health problem and a caregiver who must, if not find the solution to the problem, at least determine what should be done."
