"actions is encouraged (article 70, paragraph 5 of Protocol I). The overall idea that seems to emerge from international humanitarian law provisions regarding relief actions is that the natural manner of avoiding starvation in armed confl ict is the dispatch of food relief to starving populations. However, the experiences of the past twenty years or so demonstrate that this approach may sometimes be inevitable, but nevertheless requires great care. The autonomy of civilian populations (and, thus, their dignity) must be preserved as much as possible, even in war. The observance of other humanitarian law provisions is therefore a prerequisite: this applies to the prohibition of forced movement, of attacks on and looting of objects that are indispensable to the survival of civilians, or of means of warfare (such as the indiscriminate dissemination of landmines) that prevent the cultivation of agricultural land."
