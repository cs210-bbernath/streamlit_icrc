"macronutrients in order to satisfy energy requirements are summarized below. \n# The contribution of lipids to the overall energy intake\nLipids should account for 15 to 30% of the overall energy intake (WHO, 2003). \n# The contribution of saturated and unsaturated lipid to the overall energy intake\nThe proportion of lipids within the overall energy supply (i.e. 30%) should combine 20% unsaturated lipids -of which 2.5% essential lipids -and no more than 10% saturated lipids (WHO, 2003;European Commission, 1993). \n# The contribution of protein to the overall energy intake\nThe energy value of protein is 4 kcal (16.7 kJ)/g. Protein should account for 12 to 13% of the overall energy intake (WHO, 1988b)."
