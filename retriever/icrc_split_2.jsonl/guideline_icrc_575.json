"4. Triage should conform to a system of categorization familiar to all the health-care personnel. Triage is a continuous process: in the field, during evacuation, and at the hospital. 6. Measures should be taken to insure the safety of the wounded and the health-care personnel carrying out the triage. 7. The establishment of radio communications between the field and the facility of referral is essential to the success of the triage operation. & announce the arrival of casualties, their number, and the type of injuries; & find out how many casualties the hospital can accommodate, and avoid sending too many at once, if the hospital is unable to care for them. Where several surgical units are available, the wounded can be channeled to one or another according to the material capacities of each. # Hospital Preparation\nThe second part of managing an influx of casualties is arranging for their reception by the surgical unit. In principle, the triage teams will have informed the latter of the imminent arrival of wounded, their number, and the type of injuries. At this point, the surgical unit will begin to implement its contingency plan for incoming casualties. # Contingency Plan for Incoming Casualties\nThe contingency plan has several aspects. # Preparing the Facility\nThe hospital must be organized to receive an influx of casualties. The section designated for that purpose must be made operational immediately. The roads giving access to the hospital should be cleared to allow ambulances to pass. # Preparing the Personnel\nThe staff's duties in a situation of incoming casualties must be clearly defined in advance, so that no time is lost when the moment comes. The chief surgeon's job is to revise the operating schedule and to free beds occupied by patients who can be moved to other wards or facilities; the head nurse is usually responsible for supervising the preparation of equipment such as blood units, drugs, surgical supplies, etc. All the surgical staff should be in position, ready to assume the duties assigned to them."
