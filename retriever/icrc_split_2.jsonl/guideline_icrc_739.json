"a better adaptation of health services to the population's needs. The strategy of the first approach is based on the so-called ''trickle-down'' effect, in which resources directed towards the top of the healthcare pyramid are supposed to spread down towards the base. The second approach demands a strategy based on primary health care. One approach does not exclude the other; a happy medium must be found between the two, the main idea being to prevent and/or resolve medical problems to the extent possible. The second strategy is essential, but does not eliminate the necessity of dealing with serious medical needs in the framework of hospital facilities."
