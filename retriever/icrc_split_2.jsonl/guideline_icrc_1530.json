"In relation to the risk of demotivating recipients, assessment should, here also, demonstrate the actual need for assistance. This having been clarifi ed, the population's resilience, the advantage of extending assistance and the risk that it may be diverted to other ends must then be allowed for. As discussed earlier in this Manual, resorting to coping mechanisms should only be encouraged up to a certain point, because such action always increases vulnerability. Driving a given population to additional efforts for survival in an environment that is already hostile, or is feared soon to become so, is dangerous, and humanitarian agencies may not have the necessary skills to do this. Strengthening survival mechanisms is indeed a fashionable pursuit. However, coping mechanisms are often confused with survival mechanisms (these permit mere survival and have their limits), to the detriment of exploring new, sustainable forms of resource utilization that could ensure durable economic security. Granted, need can open the way for innovation and creativity; however this is by far not a general rule."
