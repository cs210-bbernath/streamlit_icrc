Environmental Sanitation\n\n# Human waste\nMention has already been made of the various diseases that can be transmitted to human beings through fecal contamination. Two basic ideas provide the starting point for a definition of the problem: production and transmission. # Nature of the Problem\n\n# Production\nThe quantitative aspect of human waste is considerable. On average, ''production'' of waste per person per day is estimated at 150-200 grams gross weight, and 60 grams dry weight. In terms of volume, this is the equivalent of 0.060 m 3 per person. 41 This figure gives an idea of the ''volume'' of the problem, but not necessarily of the size of the system required to dispose of the excreta, especially as other factors are involved -for example, cultural habits and the type of installation used (the main aspect of both these factors being whether or not water is used). In any case, the volume in itself is not a problem; it is the qualitative aspect of waste production that will affect health -that is, the content of the stools. Stools may contain a whole range of pathogenic germs. The following is an approximate list of the contents of one gram of fecal matter:  \n\n# Transmission of Contamination\nContamination may begin with the actual ''producer.'' Inadequate hygiene after defecation may contaminate the hands, establishing fecal-oral transmission. This is the simplest route to infection, but contamination may occur through many other mechanisms of varying levels of complexity:\n. transmission from person to person by dirty hands."
