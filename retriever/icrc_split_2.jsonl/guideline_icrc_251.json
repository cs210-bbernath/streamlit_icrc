"# Storage Storage plays a twofold role in water treatment. First, the sedimentation that occurs during storage reduces the amount of organic material in the water, so that less chlorine is required later, during chemical treatment. Second, storage helps eliminate certain pathogens -for example the cercariae that transmit schistosomiasis, and which die in the water after 48 hours. Moreover, holding the water in transparent reservoirs exposes it to ultraviolet rays from the sun, which eliminate most pathogens. 28 Technological input varies considerably according to the circumstances. It may involve anything from building a family cistern to setting up reservoirs large enough to supply a whole city with drinking water."
