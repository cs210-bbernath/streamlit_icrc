"to combine the two approaches. # Civilian populations are mixed in with armed groups\nHumanitarian aid is not intended to supply the needs of armed groups. Yet in practice, especially in situations of guerrilla warfare, civilians and soldiers are often intermingled. In certain cases, civilian populations are actually hostages of the armed groups. What, then, should be the policy of the humanitarian agencies? In theory, assistance must be exclusively reserved for non-combatants whose vital needs are not covered. In practice, it is difficult to separate the civilians from the armed groups. Aid can be planned according to the number of civilians targeted. Some of the aid will probably go to armed groups, and the civilians' vital needs may not be covered. If the armed group is included in the intervention program, the aid providers are deliberately contributing to the war effort. One way of getting around this problem is to minimize the aid's attraction for combatants; for example, relief workers could replace food distributions with meal distributions, as was done in Somalia. # Displaced and resident populations\nIn interventions to benefit displaced populations, a problem inevitably arises concerning the line to take with the resident population, who are usually no better off than the victims. Taking exclusive responsibility for displaced populations in such situations is apt to be misunderstood by the local authorities, especially since access to the displaced populations depends largely on their good will. However, this political aspect should not mask the ethical problem. And, although there is no question of ''buying'' access to the victims by including the resident populations in an extensive assistance program, the two points of view can, nevertheless, be reconciled. On one hand, humanitarian organizations cannot take care of an entire region; on the other, local authorities may argue that their people suffer from the same problems, but have not had the ''luck'' to be affected by the conflict. It may be possible to:\n. direct aid to the displaced populations in such a way that there will be positive fallout for the resident population;\n. select groups at risk, not only to help them, but also (and especially) to show the local authorities that the needs of their own people are also being taken into account."
