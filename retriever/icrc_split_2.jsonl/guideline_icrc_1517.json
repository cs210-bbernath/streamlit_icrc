"be best to set reference points, especially in preliminary appraisal. Indicator selection is determined by:\n9 the purpose of the measurement: growth and/or tissue mass; 9 available resources; 9 available time; 9 the sampling method; 9 existing data where available. MUAC, alone or related to height, is more suitable than weight measurements. \n# Screening indicator\nMUAC-for-height provides the most accurate indication of wasting, but MUAC alone is quite acceptable, and is faster. Depending on the purpose of screening and available resources, thresholds may be set that differ from conventional cut-off points. \n# Magnitude of the malnutrition problem according to its prevalence\nThe measured nutritional status of a given population must be adequately interpreted."
