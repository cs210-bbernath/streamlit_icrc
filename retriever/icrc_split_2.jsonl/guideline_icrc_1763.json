"36 Annex 15 describes its composition and utilization. Apart from infants up to 6 months, all children should receive milk, porridge, and normal meals because they will all face the same diet upon discharge, including children who are being weaned. It is important for even the youngest to grow familiar with solids, with the help of their mother and supervisors who can mash the food fi rst."
