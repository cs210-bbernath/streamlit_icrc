"never seen one drift towards health promotion and preventive activities. One feature common to any intermittent service is an influx of patients who expect the world of us, naturally including curative services. As our activities are limited in time, we must select the patients who are in the most serious condition and for whom something can be done. This is known as \"triage\". Failure to carry out triage creates confusion and jeopardizes our very presence, from the security as well as the qualitative viewpoint. Without proper triage there can be no efficient MHU. This stage, which at first sight appears to be a minor matter, is the most complex in the work of an MHU."
