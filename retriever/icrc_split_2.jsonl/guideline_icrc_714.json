"the disease and the date of contact with other cases. These three aspects constitute the traditional bases for a descriptive analysis of the epidemic: person, place, time. 71 The epidemiologist's role is not only to confirm an epidemic once it has spread, but to predict such a spread on the basis of a few declared cases. The identification of risk factors is therefore essential:\n. size of the population groups susceptible to infection;\n. way of life (overcrowding or widely scattered populations);\n. malnutrition;\n. unhealthy environment. If an epidemic has not been openly declared, but a strong epidemic potential is present, it may be necessary to take control measures very quickly."
