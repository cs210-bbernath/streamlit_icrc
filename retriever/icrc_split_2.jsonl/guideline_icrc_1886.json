"4. One fruit and vegetable complement that supplies the lacking minerals and vitamins (especially vitamins A and C) in order to avoid potentially very serious defi ciencies. The basic food should account for roughly 50 to 60% of the energy intake if it is in the form of a cereal or potato; the protein complement then accounts for 10 to 20% of the energy intake, and the energy complement 30%. The fruit and vegetable content should be approximately 40 g per meal. If the basic food is cassava, it should account for no more than 40% of the energy intake, implying that the protein complement supplies approximately 30%. The drawback of cassava is its low protein content. As an illustration, a 1-year-old child, three-quarters of whose protein requirements are to be met in the form of boiled cassava (the remainder being covered by breastfeeding), must consume 1.2 kg of this cassava and this is nearly impossible. On the other hand, if the protein complement accounts for 30% of the energy intake with a P/E ratio of 25%, then protein requirements are satisfi ed, and only 200 g of cassava need be ingested. In developing famine unfortunately, cassava is usually the last remaining foodstuff; it is then impossible to complement it properly with protein complements, and kwashiorkor (in this case dietetic kwashiorkor) can reach epidemic proportions as seen in Angola, Mozambique, and Uganda. Foodstuffs belonging to the above four categories can be found everywhere."
