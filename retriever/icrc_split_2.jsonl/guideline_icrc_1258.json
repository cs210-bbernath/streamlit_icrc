"This is the case, for example, in anthropometry, especially in using mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) or MUAC-for-height, which are faster to measure than weight and height. If almost all the subjects in a village or neighbourhood can be gathered in a central location, it is usually possible to measure them all in a matter of hours; sampling on the other hand involves counting houses or people and verifying lists fi rst, not to mention the work involved in selecting samples and sampling methods. Complete enumeration is often more acceptable for the subjects than sampling, especially if the decision to engage in assistance is to be determined by such measurements. Clearly, ensuring the reliability of results requires a good understanding of the overall population and the proportion of subjects included in the height or age category under consideration. Assuming an overall population of approximately 6,000 individuals, and a proportion of target subjects of 20%, then 1,200 subjects must be measured. The advantage is that results refl ect reality directly, and avoid the use of sampling error and confi dence intervals. The process may nevertheless be undermined by an unexpectedly low turnout of subjects due to estimation mistakes (these subjects may simply not exist) or absenteeism. Investigation must therefore determine whether the entire population has indeed been measured and, if not, why. The ensuing process is determined by the magnitude of the possible error, and the objectives of the assessment. Returning to the previous example, if only 1,000 subjects are measured, 13% of assumed subjects are missing: how does this infl uence results? To provide an answer, the 200 missing subjects are arbitrarily included in the severe or normal category: these are both extremes and highly unlikely, but doing so provides an indication as to most optimistic and pessimistic results. If among 1,000 subjects, 20% have shown severe wasting, 50% moderate wasting, and 30% an acceptable nutritional status, the 200 missing subjects should fi rst be considered as severely wasted. The adjusted distribution is then 33% severe wasting, 42% moderate wasting, and 25% acceptable nutritional status. The 200 missing subjects are then classifi ed as \"acceptable\", and the adjusted distribution becomes 16% severe wasting, 42% moderate wasting, and 42% acceptable nutritional status. Both distributions are possible, and the situation must be investigated in order to determine whether it results from the absence of subjects (absenteeism). Corroboration of the feeding process and/ or renewed measurements should then establish whether the result is closer to 33% or 16% of severe malnutrition, which is, after all, a substantial difference. Whether the objective is to obtain a rough idea of severe malnutrition rates or to compare such rates with previous or future rates, the sampling error is too signifi cant for results to be simply accepted as fi nal. This example shows that complete enumeration may indeed be faster than sampling, but may also involve serious delays if its results are questionable."
