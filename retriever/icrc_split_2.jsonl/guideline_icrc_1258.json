"no better, no worse than others and, as such, predators. In a critical situation predators seek to survive by any means, and this can involve cheating and diverting assistance. In the midst of crisis, the forces that are necessary for survival may eschew selfl essness and respect, and such behaviour is normal in the circumstances. Participatory approaches must allow for these parameters, and information and behaviours must be verifi ed whenever necessary -not only to avoid being fooled, but above all to confi rm that the chosen approach is indeed relevant or, if necessary, to take corrective action. Moreover, provided that fi eld workers know what to expect and can make themselves understood, participation is the only way of assisting crisis victims effi ciently, and ethically it is the only acceptable way."
