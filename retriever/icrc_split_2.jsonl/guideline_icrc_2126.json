"As mentioned earlier, infants may be spoon-fed practically as of birth. The use of cups and mugs is more complicated, and should not begin before 5 months. At the age of 2, children eat approximately half of what adults do. Their dishes may therefore be easily prepared by halving a standard adult ration and allowing the child to eat at its own speed. It is worth noting that 2-year-olds can easily be taught to use a spoon. # Food hygiene\nThe strict observance of basic hygiene rules is essential for infant health during the weaning process, when breastfeeding provides less and less protection against environmental pathogens -this moment unfortunately coincides with a substantial increase in the exposure to such germs. The following is a brief reminder of hygiene rules that are specifi c to the weaning process:\n9 only impeccable, washed, and freshly prepared foodstuffs should be used, and they should be peeled if necessary; 9 the persons who prepare the food and feed the child must wash their hands fi rst -the infant's hands should also be washed as it is likely to handle the food and touch its mouth; 9 utensils must be scrubbed to remove all traces of food that may cause contamination; they must then be washed in detergent and preferably boiled and left to dry (in the sun) and remain covered when not in use; 9 food must also be covered in order to protect it against fl ies and soil; 9 porridge should be boiled for at least 5 minutes in order to kill microbes, whereas mashed tubers must be prepared immediately after boiling; 9 prepared weaning foods should not be kept for more than one hour, unless they are refrigerated below 4\u00b0C. # Quality attention and healthcare\nDuring the weaning process, infants need much attention and require appropriate care quickly if infections appear."
