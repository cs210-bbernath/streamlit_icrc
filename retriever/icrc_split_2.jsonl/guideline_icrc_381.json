"Intestinal parasites, in turn, may be a public health problem for a large proportion of a population; yet, except in rare instances, they are not life-threatening. The forms of tuberculosis with positive sputum are serious; without treatment, 50% of these patients can be expected to die within two years. 46 But tuberculosis's low contagiousness (compared with that of measles, for example) and its slow progression mean that some delay in implementing a control program is permissible. # Influence of the Seasons\nThe incidence of most of the communicable diseases is seasonal. For example, epidemic meningitis develops during the dry season; the incidence of malaria, diarrheal diseases, and respiratory infections increases in the rainy season; and measles epidemics spread more easily during the dry season. It should be noted, however, that the different seasons sometimes correspond to occasions when large numbers of people are gathered together. In the case of measles, for example, the concentration of a group of vulnerable subjects probably plays a more important role in the development of an epidemic than the season during which that gathering takes place. # Possibilities of Intervention\nIn emergency interventions, what is theoretically possible will be conditioned by practical constraints. # Theoretical Effectiveness of Technical Measures\nThe technical solutions appropriate for a particular problem can be determined at the outset. This, in fact, means deciding which of the tools studied above are the most effective for controlling a given communicable disease. It is known, for example, that immunization against measles and oral rehydration therapy are effective, and that immunization against cholera is not. # Duration of Effectiveness\nMass treatment of intestinal parasites will reduce the parasitic load of individuals considerably, but its effectiveness is temporary. Sanitation measures produce a slower but more lasting effect."
