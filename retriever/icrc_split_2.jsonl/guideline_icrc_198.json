"Its implication is that no single factor (water, waste, housing) can be grasped without due consideration of the others. The most typical example is technical measures designed to protect sources of potable water. They can be really effective only if other measures are taken at the same time to control human waste and to promote personal hygiene. Practically speaking, an isolated sanitation measure which is not integrated into a comprehensive plan will a priori have little impact on a population's health status. # General Factors Influencing Relations Between the Population and the Environment\nMany general factors influence the relationship between a population and its environment. The most important ones are climate and level of development. Climatic conditions influence the relations between a population and its environment in many ways; they determine the availability of water resources, encourage or discourage the proliferation of specific communicable-disease vectors, and influence the type of housing the population will adopt. Their effects vary, of course, with the changing seasons of the year. # Problems Caused by Exceptional Situations\nExceptional situations radically change the relations between a population and its environment. Such situations involve two essential factors: changes in the environment, and population concentrations. Environmental changes may be radical. This is the case, for example, when displaced populations or refugees arrive in a new environment, or when a people's movements within its normal geographical environment are restricted. Such restrictions are usually the result of military operations: landmines placed on the roads, for example, tend to reduce access to the usual natural resources, such as water. Environmental changes usually go together with population movements."
