"Infants between 0 and 4-6 months should be exclusively breastfed. In the industrialized West however, breastfeeding is often replaced by bottle feeding with milk reconstituted from special powdered formulae. Clearly, the quality of such milk does not match maternal milk, and the use of bottles does not provide the same emotional bond between mother and child as breastfeeding does. The process itself does not entail immediate danger however, provided that it is properly followed; at the worst, it can increase the risk of obesity later. Therefore, refraining from breastfeeding in principle does not amount to poor practice. In a crisis however, it can expose the child to danger if manufactured substitutes happen to run out, and if the prevailing hygiene conditions preclude the safe preparation and preservation of milk which are essential in averting gastro-intestinal infection."
