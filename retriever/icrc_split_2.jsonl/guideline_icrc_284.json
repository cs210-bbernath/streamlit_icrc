"56\n\n# V. Site\nIt may seem paradoxical to wait until the end of the chapter to discuss the question of site, when site selection and organization depend largely on the factors that have already been discussed: the availability of water, energy sources, construction materials, and the possibility of removing solid and liquid waste. It 56 Energy-saving ovens were built in Nicaraguan refugee camps in Honduras. # Possible Housing Solutions\nPossible types of housing :\n- emergency shelters (plastic sheeting)\n- temporary dwellings:\n-tents -construction of shelters with local materials -prefabricated dwellings - permanent dwellings in a program of reinsertion or rehabilitation Factors to consider when choosing a solution:\n- necessity of finding an immediate solution - climatic conditions - cost - social customs - probable evolution of the situation is true that, chronologically, selecting the site for a displaced-person or refugee camp comes first among the problems related to environmental hygiene; only after this choice has been made will measures involving water, waste, and housing be implemented. Nonetheless, to be capable of choosing the ''right spot,'' planners must first achieve a technical mastery of the basic environmental principles studied previously."
