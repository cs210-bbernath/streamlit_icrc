"direct and immediate interest of the household than men do. In anticipation of card loss or theft, cardholders are requested to remember their card number or to write it down on a piece of paper so that they may be identifi ed in card-holder ledgers. They must also be asked to report card loss or theft if possible before the distribution date, or at least before the distribution begins. The distribution then also provides the opportunity to verify whether the missing card has indeed been lost or stolen, or whether the report is an attempt at abuse or misuse. What is considered as attempted abuse and its sanctions must be clearly defi ned prior to the distribution itself, in consultation with the local authorities."
