"Monitoring the incidence rate at regular intervals provides invaluable information as to the evolution of the situation. Incidence rates are rarely available at the stage of preliminary appraisal; they can, however, be obtained through monitoring: number of new cases during a given period incidence rate = - -----------------------------------\u00d7 \n\n# overall number of individuals at risk\nIncidence rates enable the calculation of relative risk, which is the risk faced by subjects who are exposed to a phenomenon (or risk factor) as compared to subjects who are not. Relative risk is expressed as follows:\nincidence rate among exposed subjects relative risk = - --------------------------------------\u00d7 \n\n# Prevalence\nThe prevalence rate is the number of cases at a given moment as a proportion of a specifi c group at risk. For example, the prevalence rate of malnutrition among children between 1 and 5 years is the ratio between the number of malnourished children between 1 and 5 and the overall number of children between 1 and 5, multiplied by one hundred to provide a percentage. The same reasoning may be applied to the prevalence of a given opinion: in this case, the ratio between the number of individuals that hold the opinion and the overall population, multiplied by one hundred (this is frequently done in election polls, for instance):\nnumber of cases at a given moment prevalence rate = - ---------------------------------\u00d7 \n\n# overall number of individuals at risk\nPrevalence rates refl ect the magnitude of an event at a given moment in time. They must be accompanied by some comment as to its causes, and predictions as to its most probable evolution, in order to be used correctly in terms of action. # Mortality\nThe mortality rate is the number of deaths during a specifi ed period of time as a proportion of the overall population, measured at the middle of that period, expressed in per 1,000, per 10,000, or per 100,000. Mortality rates are commonly calculated for age or sex groups, or in relation to the causes of a specifi c situation. Cause-specifi c mortality rates are useful to determine the severity of a problem, provided that valid comparison points exist. # Morbidity\nThe morbidity rate refl ects the prevalence of a given illness -it is the number of cases of illness as a proportion of the overall population. It is expressed as follows:\nnumber of cases at a given moment morbidity rate = - ---------------------------------\u00d7 100 overall number of individuals at risk\n\n# The usefulness of indicators\nIndicators are necessary in all types of assessment; this implies that preliminary appraisal must already determine what type of indicators will be used later for reference and impact appraisal. # Types of indicators 13\nIndicators can refer to anything that characterizes or infl uences a nutritional situation directly or indirectly."
