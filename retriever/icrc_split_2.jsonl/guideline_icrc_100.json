"The resulting SWOC analysis provides the basis for enhancing strengths, investigating opportunities, resolving, where possible, weaknesses and constraints, and explaining the inevitability of some of the latter. # Graphs 9\nGraphs are widely used in a humanitarian setting; they are useful for showing distributions, the evolution of a given characteristic (malnutrition, the price of basic food commodities, etc.) or the relationship between two varying characteristics. They commonly comprise a horizontal axis (x-axis, or abscissa), which usually reflects the independent variable, and a vertical axis (y-axis, or\nGuidelines for assessment in emergencies 79\nAfter the field visit ordinate), which reflects the dependent variable.
