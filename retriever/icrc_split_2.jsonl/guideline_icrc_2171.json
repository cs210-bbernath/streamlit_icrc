"Sensitivity grows with height, causing an increasing specifi city loss. On the other hand, the combination of MUAC-for-age tables (WHO, 1995) and height-for-age tables (WHO, 1983) supplies MUAC-for-age and MUAC-for-height values with the standard deviation of MUAC-for-age. The -2 Z-scores threshold is more specifi c than 85% of the median values used by de Ville de Goyet; the -3 Z-scores threshold is roughly identical to 75% of these median values."
