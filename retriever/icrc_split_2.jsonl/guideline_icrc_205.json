"Obviously, in desert regions where water is scarce and therefore precious, it will be doled out parsimoniously, or at least according to the minimum standards. Finally, the technical characteristics of the water distribution network influence the quantities of water used by a population. Many studies on such factors as the distances between water-supply points and the consumer's home have shown a relation between the quantity of water used and the distance the user needs to go to fetch it. Water use is maximal when it is available within the home. In short, the more ramified the distribution system and the closer it brings the water to the household, the greater the consumption of water. Starting from 20 liters per day, a greater impact on health status can be hoped for; but relief workers must make sure that water sources are adequate, that distribution can be relied on in the long term, and that, in the case of displaced populations, they are not creating a standard different from that imposed on the neighboring local population. In general, the standard of 20 liters per day per person can be considered appropriate for emergency situations, with the proviso that this ''norm'' is very relative and must be adjusted as the situation demands. It should be noted that the consumption of water in facilities specifically established for emergency situations (field hospitals, nutrition rehabilitation centers, etc.) is particularly high -an estimated 150-200 liters per patient per day in a hospital, and 30-40 liters per child in a feeding center. # Quality\nIn general, health personnel are much more aware of the problem of water quality than they are of the quantity required by victims during a disaster."
