"between very poor, poor, average, and rich households are established. Proportional piling may then be used to attribute population percentages to each wealth group. Paired ranking (sometimes called pairwise ranking) is also a useful method to defi ne preferences or priorities. For instance, to determine the importance of food sources (i.e. the item) informants are asked to indicate which sources they rely on. These different items (in this case sources), are then entered in the rows and columns of a matrix; the heading of column 1 is identical to that of row 1, that of column 2 is identical to that of column 2, and so on."
