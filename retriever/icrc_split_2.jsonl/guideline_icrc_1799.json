"9 If the basic ration is adequate, an SFP is unnecessary. 9 SFPs favour specifi c individuals within families, in contradiction with cultural practices providing for the collective preparation of food for all members of the family or community, except infants. 9 If the basic ration is inadequate, an effective SFP would need to be combined with it in order to raise the overall resulting daily food ration to appropriate levels for each individual. This is however absurd, because the SFP would then result in the distribution of appropriate supplements to each household rather than to targeted individuals -it would thus no longer be selective and, if combined with a GFD, there would be no reason to run two parallel distribution systems rather than one. 9 SFPs are by defi nition selective -this is because they cannot serve all the households requiring food assistance and thus target only specifi c family members or individuals, while their relatives or other individuals nonetheless continue to suffer from hunger. If SFPs cannot meet the needs of all the individuals affected by hunger, it risks causing the following negative side effects. 9 Where the distribution is aimed at already malnourished individuals, it is tempting to famish the others who might thus become eligible for inclusion in the SFP; moreover: q when the distributed ration is eaten at home, it will be shared among the family members according to domestic priorities that humanitarian agencies should not judge; the danger is for the benefi ciary not to receive what he/she requires. One solution would be to distribute supplements to all the families accommodating malnourished members, without targeting the latter specifi cally; the danger, if the crisis is deteriorating, is the probability that other households will deliberately starve one or several of their members in order for them to be included; q when the ration is eaten in the SFP distribution centre, benefi ciaries frequently receive nothing more at home, and their nutritional status either does not improve or even deteriorates as a result. 9 Where the SFP is aimed at specifi c groups prone to malnutrition, their members will be found in each family, and it will be necessary to distribute food to be eaten at home because distributing meals is unrealistic. Once again, the ration will probably be shared among the family members, and those most needing it will derive only a small benefi t. Furthermore, when access to food is inadequate (owing to an inadequate GFD, or insuffi cient individual resources), SFPs can give the impression that they compensate for this lack. They can then also provide the excuse for donors, offi cials or humanitarian agencies to spare the efforts required for an adequate GFD, and hence the necessary means to restore the population's economic self-suffi ciency. # NUTRITION MANUAL\nChapter XIV -Supplementary 1.7 The risk of negative side effects feeding programmes 1.
