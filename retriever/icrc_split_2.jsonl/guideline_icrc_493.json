"the quality of the relations between patients and health-care personnel. \n# Taking the Patient History\nAn emergency often serves as an excuse to cut short the patient's recital of complaints. Lacking a complete patient history, however, the care provider risks misdiagnosing the problem. Moreover, when the health-care personnel (expatriates, for example) are working in an unfamiliar cultural context, the quality of the patient history is apt to suffer. \n# The Clinical Examination\nTraditionally, the clinical examination is an essential step in the care-giving process; in an emergency situation, its importance is all the greater because its quality must compensate for both the deficiencies of the patient history and the lack of the technical means for radiological and biological tests."
