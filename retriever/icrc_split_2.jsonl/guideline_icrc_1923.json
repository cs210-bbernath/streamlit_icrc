"in case of failure to respond to fi rst-line therapy. In case of systematic treatment, distinctions must be made between marasmus, marasmus with complications and kwashiorkor. 1. marasmic children with no apparent sign of serious infection and no hypothermia or hypoglycaemia should receive fi rst-line treatment as follows: q Cotrimoxazole (25 mg of sulphamethoxazole + 5 mg of trimethoprim/kg), orally, twice daily for at least 5 days; 2. marasmic children with complications such as hypoglycaemia, hypothermia, septic shock, skin infections, respiratory or urinary tract infections, or lethargy; and 3. kwashiorkor cases with oedematous malnutrition -the presence of oedema is the criterion for systematic antibiotic treatment, whatever the accompanying complications."
