This implies a thorough understanding of the nature of the crisis, and the necessary analysis should in principle take place during the crisis itself. As a result, the sharing of information between the humanitarian agencies operating during a crisis and the development agencies that follow them is of utmost importance. Rehabilitation and development are diffi cult to link because very few agencies combine the two, humanitarian and development agencies differ vastly in nature, and because of the absence of a formal system to bridge the gap. Moreover, the transition to development implies the resumption of political, economic, and social stability to an extent that enables the conduct of development programmes."
