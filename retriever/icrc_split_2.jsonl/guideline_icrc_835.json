"The role of humanitarian agencies working in emergency situations is usually limited to identifying family and local economic vulnerability, with no involvement in the resolution of national and international problems. # Social Vulnerability\nThe types of social vulnerability most relevant to disaster situations are human and institutional vulnerability. # Human vulnerability\nIndividual vulnerability affects the classic vulnerable groups, who are found in disaster situations just as in normal situations. # Family vulnerability:\nThe concept of ''every man for himself'' in disaster situations must be seen in context:\n''The stress of the threat or impact will intensify the bonds between members and often the family will respond as one unit -a system. This system has flexible boundaries, open to interaction with other systems in the recovery process, either systems of extended kin or organizations that provide necessary aid and resources.'' 30 Although the family is a factor in stability, the converse is also true: family breakup is a factor in vulnerability. . Community vulnerability: A community's degree of organization and social cohesion is a key factor in its mechanism of response to disaster. According to Wilches-Chaux, ''The level of social traumatism resulting from a disaster is inversely proportional to the affected community's level of organization. Societies which possess a complete network of formal or informal social organizations can absorb the consequences of a disaster much more easily."
