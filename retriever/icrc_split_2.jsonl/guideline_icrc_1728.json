"In the absence of ready-made F-75 Formula, alternatives prepared with basic ingredients include the following. # Improvised F-75 Formula\nF-75 Formula can easily be improvised in compliance with Table 13.5 above, from powdered milk, sugar, oil, cereal fl our, and special vitamin and mineral complements. 26 The difference lies in the use of cereal fl our instead of cereal starch -this increases the protein concentration, raising the P/E% to approximately 6.5%. # ReSoMal adjunction\nIn the absence of vitamin and mineral complements, ReSoMal may be used to produce a formula that is similar to F-75 (see Table 13.6 below); this alternative however lacks vitamins, which can be supplied in the form of tablets. On the other hand, in the absence of declared vitamin defi ciency, minerals (especially zinc) are more important at this stage."
