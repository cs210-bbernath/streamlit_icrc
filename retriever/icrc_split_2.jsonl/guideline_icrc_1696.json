"5.2. # NUTRITION MANUAL Chapter XII -General food distribution 3. GFD implementation\n\n# Setting rations\nDespoiling is a more sensitive issue, especially if it is organized and systematic on the part of armed groups. In some situations, opposing groups have been known to agree on equal taxation systems and successively visited recipients to help themselves unhindered, as a part of the deal. In cases where malnutrition persists because of such practices, should losses be compensated? If they are, humanitarian agencies will inevitably be accused of supporting the war effort of such armed groups. Moreover, increasing rations can only encourage greed, and cause humanitarian agencies to be seen as profi table sources of income."
