"Feeding and fl uid intake must be stopped immediately until breathing slows down substantially -this can take between half a day and two days. # Kwashiorkor dermatosis\nThis is characterized by pigment loss (hypo-pigmentation) of the skin, shedding of the skin in fl akes or scales, and skin ulceration. Provided that feeding follows the protocols indicated above, dermatosis recedes and heals quickly (within 2 to 3 days), mainly because of the zinc contained in the diet. Because kwashiorkor cases must in any case be subjected to antibiotic treatment upon admission, the risk of infection is controlled."
