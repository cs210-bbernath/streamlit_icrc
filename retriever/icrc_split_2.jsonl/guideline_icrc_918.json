The term 'medical transports' means any land vehicle (cars, trucks, trains, etc.), ship, craft or aircraft assigned to transporting the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked, medical and religious personnel, and medical equipment.'' 26 Since protection ceases if the medical units and means of transport are used for hostile acts, the health-care personnel must apply the rules very strictly."
