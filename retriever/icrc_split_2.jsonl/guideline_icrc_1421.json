"for all individuals to be representative of the overall population. \n# Systematic random sampling\nSystematic sampling consists in selecting subjects at regular intervals (for example, every fi fth individual), starting from the fi rst subject, which is selected randomly. This method implies a comprehensive census and numbering of the population under scrutiny; it also requires a sound understanding of the local geographic or spatial organization in order to, in this case, count all subjects and then select those (in this example, every fi fth) to be included in the sample. The underlying principle is that random selection of the fi rst subject complies with the rules of chance, whereas subsequent subject selection is simplifi ed by the introduction of an interval size."
