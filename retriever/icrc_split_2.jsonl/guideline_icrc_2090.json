"If a child is clearly very ill and is likely to meet the admission criteria in the following days, it should in principle be accepted immediately, and be subjected to adequate healthcare. When targeting children under 5 years of age, attention must also be paid to their mothers' condition, especially when the child is younger than six months. Up to that age, if a child is malnourished, this is often an indication that the mother is malnourished herself, or that she is sick. If so, she also should receive food supplements to be eaten on the spot, as well as medical treatment if possible. If stricter criteria are desirable, an additional systematic selection condition could be for children to also suffer from associated infectious disease, or introduce thresholds similar to those applied for admission to therapeutic feeding centres. But the latter should only be resorted to very briefl y, shortly before the entire population is expected to enjoy adequate access to food."
