"ect actual nutritional catch-up in the early stages of recovery. When the author resorts to anthropometry, the selection criterion (or cut-off point) is a MUACfor-height lower than 75% of the reference, or -3 Z-scores. Many agencies apply the cut-off point of weight-for-height inferior to -3 Z-scores. A MUAC inferior to 11 cm is sometimes used also -this is rather severe, because in children between 2 and 4 years old, this corresponds to a MUAC-for-height of 67 and 65% respectively. It is best not to wait until the last moment to admit a child to a TFC, but rather provide it with the most chances of recovery before it is too late."
