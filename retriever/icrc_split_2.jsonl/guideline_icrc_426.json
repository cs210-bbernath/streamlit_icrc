"However, a study carried out in Ethiopia in a displacedperson camp has shown that the rate of resistance to antibiotics may be high, which makes the empirical approach very relative. 80 Treatment of Sequelae \n\n# Cholera\nCholera is discussed in the context of investigating an epidemic, in Chapter 6 (''Epidemiology''). Accordingly, only the general principles of dealing with this disease will be addressed here. Cholera is a distinctive diarrheal disease owing to its epidemiology and the severe dehydration it occasions. Fundamentally, however, it is treated in the same way as other diarrheal diseases. # Impact of the Problem\nCholera is endemic in many parts of the world; under such circumstances, it is considered to be responsible for 5% of all cases of diarrheal disease. According to WHO, cholera incidence in epidemics reaches an average of 200/100,000. In refugee camps, a much higher incidence rate of 2.5% has been registered, with a mortality rate of 3.3% among those cases. 81 In camps in northwest Somalia, a mortality rate of 25% was recorded. 82 The explanations suggested for these mortality rates were poor hygienic conditions, which favored rapid transmission, and local personnel who were unqualified to manage a cholera epidemic. Cholera is thus a potentially serious problem in displaced-person and refugee camps, and it affects adults as well as children. 83\n\n# Control Measures Preventing Transmission\nPrevention measures involving environmental sanitation and personal hygiene are similar to those used for other diarrheal diseases. They must, however, be reinforced, mainly by:\n-sterilizing patients' stools with disinfectant solutions; -following strict rules of hygiene when handling cadavers; -promoting health education (concerning personal and food hygiene), a key factor in controlling cholera. ."
