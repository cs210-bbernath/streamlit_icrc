"When, due to an exceptional situation, populations are displaced, they occasionally find refuge in an area containing no infrastructure for providing water. In such cases, a water system furnishing the minimum quantity of water consistent with the norms described earlier must be put together quickly. We will take this type of situation as our primary example in studying basic watersupply techniques. This study will follow a logical progression, from the identification of potential water sources up to the moment the water is consumed by the individual. # Water Sources\n\n# Evaluation of Water Sources\nThe purpose of evaluating water sources is to determine the best source of water supply in a given situation. As shown in the diagram, water may fall from the sky (rain), lie on the earth's surface (rivers, lakes, swamps), or be contained within the earth (ground water). A certain number of criteria can be used to judge the value of a water source in advance. These criteria are:\n-the quantity of water that the source can provide. The techniques used to estimate this quantity vary according to the type of source:\n. rain -quantity is measured by the volume of precipitation and the surface on which it falls;\n. well -the quantity is measured by the time the well takes to refill after depletion. In addition, the impact that well construction can be expected to have on the water table is assessed, 15 as is the effectiveness of the well's protection. ."
