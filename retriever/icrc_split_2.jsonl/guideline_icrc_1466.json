"Much social interaction occurs around a cup of coffee or tea, and most of it aims to preserve or restore the economic system. In this framework therefore, ration diversity reaches beyond strictly nutritional objectives, and allows for the social dimension of food. In fact, people always seek to obtain the spices and foodstuffs that are socially and culturally necessary. This is usually done to the detriment of basic rations, part of which are exchanged for such commodities."
