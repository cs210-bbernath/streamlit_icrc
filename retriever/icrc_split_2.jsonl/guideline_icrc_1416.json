"1. It involves the review of the main factors that must be allowed for in setting rations. 2. It facilitates the defi nition of reference rations that will be useful should the need for urgent action arise without the possibility of conducting proper needs assessment fi rst. Albeit theoretical, reference rations should serve to feed a given population at least initially; they must then be adjusted to reality. Because this adjustment may not take place, however, efforts must be made from the onset in order for food rations to match needs as closely as possible. The following sections therefore discuss the various aspects that must be allowed for in setting full rations, on the assumption that they will be used mainly as a source of food and that no alternative exists. Full rations should in principle supply all essential Type I and II nutrients. 9 They are set according to eating habits and macro-and micro-nutrient requirements."
