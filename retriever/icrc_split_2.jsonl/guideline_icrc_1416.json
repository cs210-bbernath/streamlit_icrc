"if the latter is to be measured later by sampling. In case of doubt as to homogeneity, different sampling methods may be used. \n# Probability sampling\nAll individuals in the group must have equal probabilities of being selected for inclusion in the sample. This requires the use of random selection and a fair understanding of the group (or population) under scrutiny. Selection methods are determined by the sampling method, which is infl uenced by the accuracy of sampling, and by constraints of time, resources, and access. \n# Accuracy\nThe accuracy of the result is determined by the size of the sample, which is set mainly by the sampling method."
