"Bags must not be stacked too high in order to prevent the stacks from collapsing, which can be dangerous. Different commodities must be stacked separately. 9 Damaged bags must be stored separately, and repacked as soon as possible if their contents can still be used. For instance: damp grain can be dried, and fl our contaminated by insects such as weevils can be sieved. If the food is damaged to the point of being unfi t for human consumption it should be disposed of by being buried, incinerated, or used as animal feed (provided that it is still suitable for the latter). 9 The golden rule of warehouse management is for the commodities that enter fi rst to be distributed fi rst, in order to ensure proper stock rotations. Foodstuffs must be identifi ed by tags and stock cards, and warehouse staff must check regularly that the tags fi xed to the commodities in fact match the stock cards; warehouse staff must also conduct regular inventories and check stacks on all four sides and the top -stock theft can escape the attention of inexperienced staff."
