"however, spoilage related to storage is of course less likely. Large, immobile stocks are expensive, and generate signifi cant risks in terms of commodity expiry, lack of use and theft. Humanitarian agencies must accept these dangers: limiting stocks reduces risks and costs for the operating agency, but exposes victims to the risk of shortage. Humanitarian action deals with uncertainty, and the best possible compromise must therefore be found -this is usually based on experience. The effi ciency of logistical support is contingent upon the information necessary to plan ahead, in order to organize transport, mobilize resources in good time, establish contingency stocks, and thus be in a position to cope with the unexpected."
