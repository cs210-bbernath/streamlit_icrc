"9 The need for assistance as highlighted by assessment:\nq the needs for assistance classifi ed according to programme; q required complementary programmes. # FEASIBILITY\nThe feasibility of a GFD is determined by access to the target population, the danger of negative side effects, prevailing security conditions, and available means. Access to the target population is in turn determined by the endorsement of the GFD on the part of relevant authorities and, in case of armed confl ict, by all parties involved. This endorsement is an operational imperative, because GFD involves heavy logistics and high visibility; as such, it is highly vulnerable to measures ranging from bureaucratic interference to armed attacks. In view of the cost of GFD and its considerable duration, these aspects cannot be dealt with lightly. Access to target populations is also determined by communications (such as the road network) and transport facilities: they must be suffi ciently reliable for GFD to run smoothly. Expected negative effects -as described above in Section 1.7.1 -must be averted or controlled if possible. Security is not only ensured by local authorities (governmental or irregular), because humanitarian operations are carried out in increasingly unstable settings which involve many different stakeholders -in such circumstances, unbridled violence, vandalism, crime and systematic looting are common fare. Such parameters may prevent the conduct of GFD altogether, and fi eld workers must be well aware of them. Security conditions must ensure that:\n9 humanitarian staff operate without foreseeable danger; 9 GFD recipients are not endangered as a result of their inclusion, and can commute to distribution points without hindrance; 9 supply is regular enough to ensure the conduct of the GFD according to plan. As already mentioned in relation to ethics, a GFD must only be planned if funding and resources in terms of staff, infrastructure, logistics, and food is adequate, that is, that such means are suffi cient to carry it out to its completion. # INTEGRATION INTO THE OPERATIONAL STRATEGY\nGeneral distribution is seldom an isolated operation because it usually contributes to a general goal."
