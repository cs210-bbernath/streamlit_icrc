"to eat peacefully -this is one operational condition for success. Inasmuch as possible, children above 2 years of age should report unaccompanied; assistants (1 for 30 benefi ciaries) are precisely required to help such benefi ciaries and give them attention and care. This practice limits attendance, and limits the risk of carers eating to the detriment of the patients. Obviously, carers can be issued with snacks, provided that this does not disrupt the TFC procedure. After the meal, benefi ciaries wash their hands and supervisors collect the cutlery and crockery. The latter must be washed in hot water and detergent immediately, rinsed with drinking water, set out to dry (preferably in the sun), obviously in a clean place, and fi nally stored in a closed place, sheltered from insects and other pests."
