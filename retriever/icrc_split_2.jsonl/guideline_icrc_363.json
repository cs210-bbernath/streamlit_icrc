"initial stages, the number of patients requiring treatment is substantial. -Reduction of treatment cost Treatment cost here is not the cost of the drugs used, but is calculated according to the number of patients cured in relation to those who would be cured by the conventional treatment. This analysis is particularly pertinent in the case of tuberculosis: in 1986, the cost of the short treatment was estimated at $158, while the cost of the long treatment was figured at $123. If figured on the basis of the cost per patient cured, however, this ratio was reversed (respectively, $314 versus $368)."
