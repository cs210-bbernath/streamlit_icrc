"MANUAL 3.3 Targeting groups Chapter XII -General food distribution 3. GFD implementation 3.4 Attending to groups results in serious negative effects; this is all the more obvious in armed confl ict.

Either way, the community must, here too, be involved directly in the targeting process in order to fi nd the best possible compromise."
