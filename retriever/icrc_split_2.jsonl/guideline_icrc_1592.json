"Figure 12.3 below provides a typical example of a distribution point, attention desks, and benefi ciary movements. # Food distribution\nThe distribution of individual parcels or survival rations is usually simple, as the number of parcels should amount to the number of cards. Distribution from bulk consignments (or \"scooping\", for example the distribution of fl our out of bags) is usually more quickly and often more accurately done according to volume rather than weight. This involves the use of calibrated containers to ensure the distributed volume corresponds to the intended weight. To be calibrated, empty containers are used to zero the scale, and are then fi lled with the amount of the chosen commodity that corresponds to one ration (e.g. 12 kg of cereal). This level is then marked on the side of the container: this sets the volume representing the desired weight of that commodity per ration. Containers are then emptied and the mark reinforced in permanent ink or paint, in a fi ne but clearly visible line. During distribution, containers must be fi lled to a level surface up to the mark. The process may be simplifi ed by cutting containers off at the required level instead of just marking them -then a ruler or board can be run across their top to produce a levelled quantity. Clearly, containers must all be calibrated on the same scales, which have been tested beforehand. It is best to use the same containers for the same type of foodstuff in order to avoid confusion. The calibration and general preparation of the required material must of course be done well before the fi rst distribution round, and the staff in charge must practice beforehand."
