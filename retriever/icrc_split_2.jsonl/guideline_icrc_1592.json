"the GFD in terms of recovering their economic self-suffi ciency. Side effects are negative if they are harmful. For example, a drop in market prices may be benefi cial if it improves the access to food for those who are not directly included in the GFD but nevertheless face economic stress. The effect is however negative if it triggers off speculation and armed groups support it and exercise retaliation, which in turn causes serious security problems, both for the recipients of food aid and for those delivering it. Agencies must be aware of this pitfall and anticipate it as much as possible: negative effects may be limited or avoided if all stakeholders are well informed of the operation, and comply with assistance modalities."
