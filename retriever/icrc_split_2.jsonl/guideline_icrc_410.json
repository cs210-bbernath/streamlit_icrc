"Depending on the situation, the rate of complications can be very high. In a study carried out in Zimbabwe which followed 1,399 children hospitalized for measles, 804 (57%) of them developed complications. 66 The mortality rate varies considerably, depending on whether the sick children have access to health care or not. It may fluctuate from 1-3% up to 50%, the rate registered during epidemics in Sahelian villages. Measles also causes complications in the form of malnutrition and ocular lesions due to vitamin A deficiency. Displaced-person and refugee camps must be considered by definition to present maximum risk, measles being unquestionably a high-priority problem."
