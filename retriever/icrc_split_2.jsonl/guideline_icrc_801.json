"The strategy used by humanitarian agencies occasionally goes against this tendency for the sake of short-term effectiveness. Although a certain independence is necessary, especially in conflict situations, it does not preclude integration of the aid within the local health-care system -if one exists. The important point to remember is that all measures taken to enhance health (both preventive and curative measures) must be integrated into a coherent health-care system. Chapter 8\n\n# DISASTERS AND DEVELOPMENT\nThe inclusion of a chapter on development in a book about emergency situations may seem surprising, since the two subjects are apparently quite unrelated, even incompatible. Emergency situations are often accused of draining financial and human resources that would have been better employed for development. Yet, some observers believe that disaster situations create propitious conditions, in the form of favorable socioeconomic changes, for new development programs. The purpose of this chapter is to give health-care personnel working in emergency situations a better understanding of what development is, to define the ways their relief operation activity might endanger a development process, and, finally, to identify possible links between emergency operations and development activities. # I."
