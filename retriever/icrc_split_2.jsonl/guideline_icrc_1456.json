"not \u00b1 5% as suggested by the initially chosen accuracy. In cluster random sampling, the formula used to obtain actual accuracy is not determined by sample size, but by the differences in results from different clusters. The resulting formula is the following:\naccuracy = \u00b1 \u03b5 \u00d7 {\u03a3 i = 1 to k (p i -p) 2 / } 1/2\nWhere: p = the actual overall prevalence rate in the entire sample, say 30.1% k = the total number of clusters included in the sample, say 5 i = a given cluster within the overall sample (numbered 1 to k) p i = the actual prevalence rate in cluster i n = the actual sample size = 220 \u03a3 = the sum of all values\nIf the results obtained from the 5 clusters in the sample are 28.5%, 24.2%, 33.1%, 27.2% and 30.9%, the sum of (p i -p) 2 is calculated as follows:\nThis then permits the calculation of accuracy itself: accuracy = \u00b1 1.96 \u00d7  1/2 = \u00b1 3.3%\nAnd the fi nal result is then 30.1 \u00b1 3.3%."
