"In practice, crisis situations (where severe malnutrition rises, and national services are non-existent or saturated) must be distinguished from chronic situations (where severe malnutrition is endemic and seasonal, and national services are non-existent or insuffi cient). In crisis situations, the number of patients is the determining parameter. In famine, the number of severely malnourished subjects is always suffi cient to justify therapeutic feeding and the introduction of a TFC. However, a threshold number of individuals must be set when a given phenomenon affects the nutritional status only marginally, and when severe malnutrition is scattered."
