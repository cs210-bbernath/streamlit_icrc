"avoiding premature (i.e. untimely) harvesting and, thus, mitigate the effects of the forthcoming hunger season; 2. avoiding consumption of seed grains in cases of food scarcity; 3. protecting the workforce by sparing recipients the search for scarce food; 4. preserving the time required for essential activities, such as infant care; 5. limiting food prices on local markets, thus making food more accessible; 6. providing an economic resource that may be sold or exchanged, and thus open access to other essential goods and services in the absence of alternatives; 7. saving recipients from the decline into impoverishment and capital loss through the forced disposal of their essential assets in order to obtain food; 8. enabling recipients to rehabilitate their means of production in order to recover their economic self-suffi ciency. # OPERATIONAL PRIORITY\nIn a nutritional crisis, GFD is usually an operational priority as (provided that it meets the criteria below) one of the only available means to humanitarian agencies to improve the economic system of crisis victims in a polyvalent way. By preventing impoverishment, capital loss, and starvation,\n1.4 Operational priority 1. General considerations 1.5 Criteria for intervention GFD therefore usually takes precedence over other \"nutritional\" measures such as supplementary or therapeutic feeding, and nutritional sensitization and information. On the other hand, it must be supported by representations aimed at enforcing the respect of fundamental rights. 1 It may be secondary to more urgent operations in the fi eld of water and habitat; it must often combine with non-food relief, in order to enhance its nutritional benefi ts. 2\n\n# CRITERIA FOR INTERVENTION\nSince food is an economic resource, the criteria for GFD rest less on the nutritional status of the proposed recipients than on their ability to secure food, and at what cost. Their nutritional status is simply an additional variable that improves accuracy as to the level of the famine process that has been reached; it however also provides indications as to the possible impact of infectious disease. With reference to the crisis process, 3 the causes of famine, and coping mechanisms, 4 GFD is necessary when a given group:\n9 has lost its access to food (whatever the reasons); 9 faces insuffi cient access to food, whatever the means deployed to obtain it, and whatever the dangers entailed by this (see Section below); 9 still retains access to food, but this access entails dangers:\nq excessive time must be devoted to the securing of food, to the detriment of other activities required for individual and household survival; q assets that are required for household survival must be disposed of in order to obtain food (capital loss stage); q unusual or toxic foods or seeds must be eaten (chemically-treated seeds are also toxic), or unripe food from premature harvesting; q obtaining food entails security risks (especially for women); 9 retains access to food, but this access will shortly be insuffi cient; 9 can only access the goods and services required for its survival in exchange for food. GFD must be implemented only if the anticipated duration of the problem is suffi cient and the operation proper can begin early enough for it to have an impact. For example, a population may suffer from famine, but its forthcoming harvest is anticipated to be good within a couple of months, and the GFD cannot be set up within that timeframe -in this case, a GFD is pointless. Because of the range of circumstances and conditions that justify the implementation of a GFD, GFD food rations can clearly not be set rigidly. Besides, GFD provides a resource whose purpose is not limited to the supply of nutrients. Furthermore, this resource is suffi ciently substantial to entail secondary and negative effects (the role of food and the possible effects of GFD are discussed in the following two points). # NUTRITION MANUAL\nChapter XII -General food distribution 1. General considerations 1.6 The broader role of food\n\n# THE BROADER ROLE OF FOOD\nGFD should provide nutrients, and caloric nutrients provide the quantitative reference. Therefore, GFD rations are usually defi ned according to the energy requirements of the target group. Beyond the diffi culty of setting the calorie level of rations on a nutritional basis, the fact that food represents more than just nutrients and calories must also be considered. Indeed, its fundamental nutritional role provides it with social, economic and political dimensions that shape its use, and often makes it a vital issue. # The social dimension of food\nFood must be consumed daily in order to meet the nutritional need of humans. In primitive societies, most production activities are related to the securing of food, which thus plays a central role. This role has been preserved in all societies up to now, and food is no doubt the most fundamental commodity and symbol of social exchange. The banquets of Antiquity, ritual mediaeval meetings or reconciliation feasts, modern day business lunches, and hospitality etiquette all refl ect the essential role of the sharing of food in political, economic, and social activities in all cultures. In particular, the use of specifi c foods demonstrates the individual's inclusion in the group."
