"This implies the introduction of monitoring systems to follow up general distribution. In this respect (because average adult weight infl uences the average nutritional need), the body mass index (BMI) of an adult population sample may be recorded at the time of distribution in order to determine its nutritional status and the average weight for ration calculation. The recorded weight cannot be that prevailing in the case of malnutrition, but must be at least the minimum still considered as a good nutritional status according to BMI categories used in this Manual: at least 18.7 for women and 20.1 for men. # Micro-nutrient requirements\nFull rations should supply all essential micro-nutrients (i.e. vitamins and essential minerals), in line with recommended intakes. 16 There are 35 essential micro-nutrients, some of which are \"Type II\" micro-nutrients, meaning that they must be supplied in a stoechiometric 17 relation. The micro-nutrient requirements of groups that rely entirely on food aid are certainly most diffi cult to satisfy."
