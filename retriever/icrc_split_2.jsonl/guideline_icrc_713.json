"These consequences can be divided into two categories:\n. population concentrations -the often precarious hygiene conditions obtaining in camps or other densely populated locations may pose the threat of epidemics. 68 However, several conditions must be present simultaneously (infectious agents, vulnerable population, vector) if an epidemic is to take hold. Thus, a population that moves out of a cholera-free region into another cholera-free region runs no particular risk of contracting this disease, whereas an epidemic of malaria is almost inevitable in a non-immune population arriving in an area where malaria is hyperendemic -unless appropriate measures are taken. ."
