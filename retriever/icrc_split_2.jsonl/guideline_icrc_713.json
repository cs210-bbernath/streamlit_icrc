"some diseases -meningitis, for example -epidemic thresholds can be established. For other diseases, the local context must be used as a reference. The cases will be inventoried on the basis of the data collected by the health-care facilities, or from cases found among the population. The information recorded for each case should reflect:\n. the profile established for the case -for example, clinical signs such as fever, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. . the requirements of future analysis concerning:\n-the group of people most affected (for which data on age, sex, occupation, etc., will be needed); -the geographical areas most affected (origin of cases); -the onset of the disease and the date of contact with other cases."
