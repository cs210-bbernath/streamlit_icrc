"expected if there were no differences between the population groups. 41 Degree of freedom: When the number of values exceeds 4, we must take account of the degree of freedom, which is the number of values minus 1 in the column of tabulated values multiplied by the number of values minus 1 in the row of values. 42 The standard error of the difference is calculated as follows:\nCombined variance of the two variances of each sample s = (n 1 -1) (variance 1) 2 + (n 2 -1) (variance 2) 2 n 1 + n 2 -2 Standard error of the difference = sH1/n 1 +1/n 2 The t test formula becomes:\nt =\nDifference between the two means Standard error of the difference EPIDEMIOLOGY Logically, as the value of t increases, so does the probability of exceeding the limits of the confidence interval (between which 95% of the means of a single population should fall), and so does the certainty that the means observed in fact belong to two different populations -although always with some probability of error."
