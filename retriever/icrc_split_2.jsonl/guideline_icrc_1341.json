"Maps can be produced easily (should they be unavailable or to suit specifi c purposes) by using a compass and a speedometer mile count, or any other more or less artisanal method. Transects show the main sub-areas according to land use within an overall area, according to the most relevant section. They are particularly useful in identifying critical spots and in describing individual ecosystems and agricultural systems (McCracken, 1988)."
