"tissue loss (parasite infection, and sub-clinical infl ammation and oedema). Measuring brachial circumference amounts to measuring tissue that serves as nutritional reserves (i.e. lean mass and adipose tissue), and any variation in this circumference indicates variation in these tissues exclusively. The method is independent of age. It is not more diffi cult to measure than height or weight, but is faster. Doctor Briend considers that combining MUAC and height does not signifi cantly improve the estimation of nutritional status (Briend, 1995). Indeed, arm circumference only increases by about 1.5 cm between 1 and 5 years; in other words, the 13.5 cm cut-off point corresponds to 85% of the reference in a 1-year-old infant, and to 78% in a 5-year-old child."
