"number of parcels should amount to the number of cards. Distribution from bulk consignments (or \"scooping\", for example the distribution of fl our out of bags) is usually more quickly and often more accurately done according to volume rather than weight. This involves the use of calibrated containers to ensure the distributed volume corresponds to the intended weight. To be calibrated, empty containers are used to zero the scale, and are then fi lled with the amount of the chosen commodity that corresponds to one ration (e.g. 12 kg of cereal). This level is then marked on the side of the container: this sets the volume representing the desired weight of that commodity per ration."
