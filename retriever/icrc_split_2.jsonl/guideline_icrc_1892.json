"hours -fl uid loss is roughly 100 to 110 ml/kg. \n# Causes of dehydration\nDehydration frequently results from recent and profuse episodes of watery diarrhoea; diarrhoea is thus a good indicator in explaining substantial fl uid loss. If dehydration is suspected, the patient's recent history of diarrhoea episodes must therefore be systematically documented. In a TFC in famine settings however, dehydration may also result from non-pathological losses that are not compensated by adequate fl uid intake. This is commonly noted during admission, in patients who have travelled a long distance in the heat, without proper access to water. In other words, severe dehydration may be totally unrelated to diarrhoea or septic shock."
