"easy as possible, and the emphasis is on preventive measures. One difference, however, is that in emergency situations, results are expected within a couple of weeks, while results from PHC are part of the strategy of ''health for all by the year 2000.''\nA second difference lies in the population's preliminary involvement in selecting the intervention programs. Taking the ''wants/needs'' formulated by the population into account is imperative in the framework of PHC, whereas in emergency situations, health measures are usually imposed by humanitarian agencies. On occasion, however, a synthesis of the two different approaches may be possible. Emergency actions may then be considered as a group of specific interventions which, despite everything, are coordinated to a certain degree."
