"In a newly created camp for displaced people, medical needs are multiplied two or three times over. There have been a few cases where the national health-care system completely collapsed -for example, in Cambodia in 1979 and in Somalia in 1991. # The Distinction between ''Wants'' and ''Needs''\nA distinction must be made between:\n& wants, the expression of what the victims themselves want from the health-care services; and\n& needs, the care and s e r v i c e s t h a t t h e health-care personnel consider necessary for the victims. In normal situations, the health-care facilities generally take both these factors into account, offering the population services that correspond to both their wants and their ''real'' needs as defined by health-care professionals. There should be a concurrence between real needs, experienced needs (wants), and the technically and financially possible responses. In times of disaster, the effort to reconcile ''needs'' and ''wants'' is usually cut short. Humanitarian organizations tend to impose a health-care system that will cover the victims' immediate needs. This approach should not be considered as a form of humanitarian imperialism; it is dictated by the urgency of meeting the victims' vital needs, by the know-how acquired in previous crisis experience, and, especially, by the human and financial resources that the agencies are able to muster. Although the imperative of quick action should not obscure the importance of considering the victims' wants, in this respect there is a major difference between emergency situations and normal situations. # Levels of Health Care\nThere are several levels of health care. # The family level:\nA certain amount of health care, both preventive and curative, can be provided within the family itself, by family members or by community health workers. 2 ."
