"-The potential of existing local facilities The degree to which local facilities can meet demand varies from one situation to the next. It should be noted that in most developing countries, the relevant health services, particularly pediatric services, are already overburdened. A massive influx of patients suffering from severe malnutrition and requiring 24hour care exacerbates an already precarious situation. When the number of beneficiaries exceeds the capacity of the local facilities, the construction of autonomous NRCs must be contemplated. What Kind of NRC Should Be Built? Theoretically, an NRC should be able to provide all the types of NRP that treat the severe forms of malnutrition. For practical reasons, however, the usual procedure is to construct units differently depending on whether the beneficiaries will be treated on a residential or outpatient basis."
