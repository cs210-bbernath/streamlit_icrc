Certain international agencies influence national policies, such as WHO (founded in 1946) in the health field, the ILO (International Labor Organization, founded in 1919) in the realm of labor law, and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, founded in 1945) in the education field.
