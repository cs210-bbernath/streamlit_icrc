"Drawbacks: the method is less accurate than the QUAC Stick method. # Conventional cut-off points and classifi cation:\n9 > 14 or 13.5 cm: satisfactory nutritional status 9 14 or 13.5 to 12.5 cm: moderate malnutrition 9 < 12.5 cm: severe malnutrition. # Anthropometry in adults\nThe index that is most commonly used for adults is the Body Mass Index (BMI) or Qu\u00e9telet index. This method reveals wasting; the BMI is calculated by dividing weight expressed in kilograms by height (expressed in metres) squared: --------------height 2 (m)\n\n# weight (kg) BMI = -\nBMI is independent of height: if the index is identical for subjects of different heights, then the nutritional reserves of the organism are comparable. Variables that infl uence the interpretation of weight measurements are far less signifi cant in adults than in children."
