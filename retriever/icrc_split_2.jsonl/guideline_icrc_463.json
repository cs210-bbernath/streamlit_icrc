Treatment is often empirical. \n# Treatment of Suspected or Confirmed Cases\nThe advent of short treatments for most intestinal parasitic diseases has simplified the therapeutic approach to amebiasis (Fasigyne), and ascariasis and hookworm (Albendazole). \n\n# Mass Treatment\nAccording to WHO, 119 mass treatment can be undertaken in three ways:\n-treatment of the entire population; -treatment of all infected subjects, whether ill or not; -treatment of the groups most susceptible to infection."
