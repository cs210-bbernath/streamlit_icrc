"However, the existence of such a gap alone is not enough; it remains to be seen whether the gap reveals a problem, and whether the latter may worsen over time. Ultimately, the idea is to determine what level of the famine process 8 the population has reached at the time of assessment (adaptation, impoverishment, capital loss, or starvation), and the probable evolution of its economic behaviour and performance. Problems, as defi ned here, arise when the population has exhausted its specifi c reserves, that is, when it no longer has any other option but to resort to its survival reserves (see Figure 6.14). This option is dangerous, because it undermines the economic production capacity and the functional capacity of the organism."
