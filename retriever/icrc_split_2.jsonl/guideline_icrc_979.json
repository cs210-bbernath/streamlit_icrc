"In every case, the consequences of deciding to use outside resources must be carefully weighed. For example, the food resources required for a relief operation may be purchased in the trouble zone itself; or in the country, but outside the trouble zone; or in neighboring countries; or, finally, they may be imported from Europe, the US, or other surplus countries. Merely ascertaining whether food is available locally is not sufficient; a whole group of factors must be analyzed. # Buying locally\nBuying locally offers several advantages: costs are lower (food, transport, maintenance, etc.), the food is more quickly available (short transport time, no customs duty), and it is better suited to local dietary habits. All these factors make local purchasing very attractive. However, it should be remembered that local buying may unbalance a shaky local market, and that local merchants will refuse to sell their food stocks in order to push prices up. # Buying in neighboring countries\nThe risks involved in buying supplies in the bordering regions or countries are the same as for buying locally, though they are less certain and less extensive. # Importing from Western countries\nImporting food from Western countries presents major disadvantages in terms of delivery time and cost (even if it is not the aid agency that foots the bill, in the case of donated goods and transport). Moreover, there is a risk of importing food inappropriate to local conditions. Just as the introduction of new medical intervention strategies (such as for tuberculosis) is risky, so the introduction of new technologies or products may have harmful consequences. Here again, this does not mean that anything new should automatically be rejected; but a distinction must be made between what is appropriate and what is not."
