"this can cause problems for some older children and adults. \n# Infant feeding\nUnlike the above, the hazards associated with using artifi cial milks for infant feeding are widely known and very well documented. It is not unreasonable to assume that these hazards are greatly magnifi ed in times of disaster. Artifi cial milk distributed indiscriminately to disaster victims will inevitably be fed to babies and young children. It is vital to promote breast feeding for as long as possible under such conditions. Maternal illness, malnutrition and stress can lead to \"failure of lactation\", but the emphasis must always be on restimulation of lactation rather than on giving artifi cial milk to those vulnerable children."
