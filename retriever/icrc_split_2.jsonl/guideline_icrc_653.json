"such a point that they are considered to be different. This sort of error is termed an ''error of the first kind,'' or type I error. For example, if we compare a control population in which variable X is 15%, while the true value of the variable in the population studied is 14%, we can say that the results are similar. However, since the study is based on samples, 95% of the values of the variable detected in a sample of n size will fall between + 1.96 standard errors. If, for example, the standard error is 2.95%, means found for samples of a given size n will fall between 11% and 19%, corresponding to the limits of the 95% confidence interval (z = 1.96)."
