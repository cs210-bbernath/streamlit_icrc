"In practice, few patients agree to be evacuated, as that involves leaving too heavy a social and family burden behind them. Furthermore, they worry about whether and how they will be able to return to their homes. Some examples : -In Rwanda, the MHUs in the buffer zone evacuated the most serious cases to Rutongo hospital by ambulance. -In Colombia, arrangements have been made for primary and secondary level hospitals to receive patients sent to them by the ICRC, which pays the transport costs (no ambulance service). -In Sri Lanka, patients who were seriously ill were transferred to three hospitals in the Vanni region. # MHUs are not tools for assessing a health zone\nAny assessment generates considerable expectations among the potential beneficiaries. To avoid disappointing the population groups concerned (this might cause security problems), it is important not to confuse assessment with strategy for action. MHUs are a strategy for responding to a health problem, and not an evaluation tool. An MHU is not set up to assess the needs of a population group, \"to see who will turn up, and with what sort of problem\". On the other hand, where there is a vaccination MHU it is a good idea to take advantage of our presence to assess more precisely the needs for protection and assistance in the health zone concerned. # Health personnel are responsible for the ICRC's MHUs\nThe possibility of providing high-quality service, the short-term and long-term implications, the costs, the coherence of the programme, and above all its time frame, are factors that only the person in charge of the health team can assess. The same person will be responsible for adapting the MHU strategy to changes in the political, health or security situation. The MHU strategy is therefore not a political decision but one taken on the basis of the health situation, and the main criterion for that decision is the quality of the services that can be provided. # MHUs are expensive to run\nOnly very specialized services such as dentistry and ocular surgery have proved their efficiency. # MHUs are often a \"logistical nightmare\"\nMHUs by definition set out to reach population groups isolated because of poor security or difficulty of access. The logistical aspect of their activities becomes a major constraint which must be taken into account (see Section 14 : \"Frequency, schedules and communications\")."
