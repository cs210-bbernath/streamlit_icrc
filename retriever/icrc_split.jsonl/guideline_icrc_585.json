"instability makes countries particularly vulnerable to disasters. The presence of an armed conflict in Ethiopia potentiated the devastating effects of the 1984 drought, by delaying and then limiting access to the areas affected by the lack of water. Populations may lack autonomy due to: . the authoritarianism of a political regime which leaves little scope for individual and community initiatives; this type of ''political culture'' may remain very strong even during disaster situations; . bureaucracy, often associated with authoritarianism, which tends to slow down and sometimes block the decisions that need to be made in an emergency; . the absence of a contingency plan for disasters; the ''disaster formula'' defined earlier shows well the importance of prevention and preparation measures. To be carried out, however, such measures must first of all be integrated in a national disaster contingency program, and, second, be motivated by a real political will to implement them. These conditions are seldom met, owing to inadequate economic means and contradictory social priorities."
