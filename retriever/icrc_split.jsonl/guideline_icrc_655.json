"accordance with internationally recognized standards. # Long-Term Solutions Three solutions can be envisioned in the long term: . repatriation to the country of origin; . settlement in the host country; # resettlementinathirdcountry. Repatriation to the country of origin is the most sensible solution, since it restores refugees to their own sociocultural environment. Repatriation must be voluntary, and it is essential that protective measures be taken, including an assurance that the security conditions that caused the refugees to flee in the first place have been resolved, a guarantee that essential needs can be met as soon as the refugees return home (housing, food, etc.), and, finally, measures to afford refugees some possibility of finding a job again. Settling the refugees in the first host country is also an option, if the security conditions of the country of origin remain uncertain and the host country agrees to integrate the refugees into the local population. ;; ;; ;; @@ @@ @@ ;; ;; ;; @@ @@ @@ ;; ;; ;;"
