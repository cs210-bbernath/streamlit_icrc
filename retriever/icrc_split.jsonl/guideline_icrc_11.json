"reach population groups cut off from health services. The main objective of the use of MHUs is to improve the access of these population groups to the health system. MHUs are popular and flexible. They are deployed : -on a temporary basis, before the opening (or reopening) of permanent health facilities (health posts or centres) ; -to refer isolated population groups to existing health facilities. 9 There are virtually no articles in the literature relating to MHUs with broad fields of activity; on the other hand there are numerous articles devoted to specific \"vertical\" curative programmes (surgery, 10 specific diseases such as leprosy, 11 malaria, 12 echinococcosis, 13 etc.). Many articles stress the importance of there being a fixed health facility 14,15 on which the MHU can depend (for example, a health centre or a hospital offering specialized surgical services for conditions such as cataract or glaucoma). This fixed facility has a dual role : 16 1. selection of patients; 2. follow-up of patients after the departure of the MHU."
