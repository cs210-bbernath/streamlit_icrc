"spontaneous reporting of patients to the centre. # Selection Selection should always be done outside the centre; it is especially inhumane to accept a mother and her sick child into the compound, then simply to reject her for reasons that escape her, after lengthy waiting and clinical and anthropometric examination processes. Selection rests on the clinical appraisal of marasmus, oedema, associated disorders, the level of dependency and the ability to feed oneself. This process requires a sound knowledge of malnutrition, experience, and self-possession. All oedematous cases should be admitted. It may be useful to measure the mid-upper arm (or brachial) circumference (MUAC) in order to distinguish between individuals that share the same appearance. However, anthropometry should never provide the only basis for the admission of non-oedematous patients, especially if the method used is the weight-for-height index; 5 this index can in fact be quite misleading because it takes the entire organism into account, including subclinical oedema, intestinal parasites, and fl uid retention resulting from infection and infl ammation."
