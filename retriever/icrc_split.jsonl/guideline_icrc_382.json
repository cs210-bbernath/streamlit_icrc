"involves considerable speculation. # Allocation of Responsibilities The Family In a camp, at least at the beginning, it is difficult to organize family medicine cabinets; later on, the idea can be considered, but any drugs distributed in this way are very likely to be sold to offset the displaced people's lack of financial resources. Moreover, if secondary-level health facilities (dispensaries, healthcare centers) are readily accessible, there is little sense in handing drugs over to the family. # The Community In a camp enjoying the services of trained CHWs, a framework should be created for them; where there are none, training CHWs is a priority in order to cover basic medical problems in a satisfactory manner. At the same time, facilities should be planned for them to work in. # The Dispensary If the number of displaced people is not too large, an effort should be made to find local facilities, if possible, that can meet the needs of the new population."
