"be fi ne-tuned by selecting the fi rst subject in a given direction; this involves counting all subjects in that direction, and then observing them according to a given interval. Simple random sampling is often referred to as \"two-stage sampling\": the fi rst stage is the selection of clusters, and the second is the selection of subjects within clusters. Systematic random sampling involves three stages: the fi rst is the identifi cation of sub-sections, the second is the identifi cation of clusters within the sub-sections, and the third is the selection of subjects within the clusters. Cluster random sampling is illustrated in Figures 10.8 and 10.9 below. The example of systematic cluster random sampling provided in Figure 10.9 refl ects the division of the area into 8 sub-sections. The interval size used to attribute clusters to sub-sections is 500, and the fi rst subject selected randomly is 450. # Stratifi ed random sampling Stratifi ed random sampling consists in defi ning, within a given area, groups (based on sex, age,"
