"subjects in each cluster will not significantly increase the accuracy of the results; 36 it is preferable to increase the number of clusters. In the example given here, the second option (50 clusters of 8 children) would provide greater accuracy. 36 N. Birkin et al., op. cit., p. 99. # Geographical Location of Clusters Sampling frame # List of populations # Locations Add the sampling interval to the random number to obtain the level of the second cluster. Add the sampling interval again and again until the number of the total population is attained. # Sampling interval # Applications in Emergency Situations Emergency situations involving large populations provide ideal terrain for sampling of all kinds, whether the objective is to measure nutritional status, to study the incidence of basic medical problems, or to assess access to sources of potable water. In such situations, an estimate is made of the value to be measured and the limits between which the result should fall."
