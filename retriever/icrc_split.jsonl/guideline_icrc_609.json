"rehabilitating them is appropriate, or whether perhaps they should be structurally modified to make them more effective. In this case, real development programs must be envisaged, comprising two lines of action. One will involve examining system vulnerability, determining corrective measures, and applying them; the other will seek to develop existing local capacities and give the local personnel responsibility for implementing all stages of the programs. Overall, development programs should help raise people's standard of living and make them less vulnerable to disasters. The number of natural disasters continues to increase as years go by, as does their impact on the socioeconomic sector, 53 leading to an ever-widening gap between the needs of the vulnerable groups and the local capacity to meet them. The reasons for this growing gap should be sought in the deteriorating economic situation of many developing countries, the degeneration of the environment, migration to the cities, increased technological risks, and the burden of demographic growth, which forces entire populations to move into high-risk areas."
