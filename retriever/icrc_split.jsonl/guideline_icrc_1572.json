"implementation 3.2 Setting rations are called \"low-fat\" when their contribution represents 30% of the overall energy intake; if their contribution is 22%, they are called \"very low-fat diets\" (Shils, 1994). # The protein/energy ratio In the discussion on nutritional needs, Chapter III demonstrated that diets that supply enough energy usually supply enough protein also. This is noted especially in the case of food rations that combine cereals and legumes. The proportion between protein and energy is expressed as a percentage of the energy value 11 of the protein and the overall energy supply: this is the \"P/E%\" ratio below. # G \u00d7 Kp P/E% = --------------\u00d7 100 Kr Where: G = the protein weight in the ration K = the calorie value Kp = the calorie value of the protein contained in the ration (kcal/gram, or kJ/gram) Kr = the overall calorie value of the ration (kcal or kJ) For example, a ration that supplies 2,400 kcal (10,032 kJ) in total, with 70 g of protein,"
