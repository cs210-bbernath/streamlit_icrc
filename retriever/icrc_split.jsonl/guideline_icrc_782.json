"cardiac function in order to maintain blood circulation. The cardiac muscle, already weakened by the defi ciency in thiamine, must therefore produce an additional effort that causes its dilatation and failure, which accentuate oedema (this is referred to as high-output cardiac failure). Cardiac failure can occur at any moment and cause acute circulation failure, and death. Clinical signs include oedemas (usually in the legs, but sometimes on the face and chest); patients present palpitations, shortness of breath, an accelerated pulse, and neck vein swelling with visible pulsations. Diastolic arterial pressure diminishes, and systolic pressure increases proportionately. Patients may complain of leg pains following mild effort such as walking. While blood circulation still functions properly, the extremities feel hot because of vasodilatation. The urine volume diminishes, but without an increase in urinary albumin excretion (albuminuria), enabling diagnosis orientation. When cardiac failure appears, the skin turns cold and cyanosed, particularly in the face, oedemas spread and shortness of breath (dypsnoea) intensifi es. Patients remain alert, however, and may even appear reasonably well,"
