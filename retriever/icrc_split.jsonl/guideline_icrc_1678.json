Foods should be appropriate to the benefi ciaries to: q meet nutritional needs; q maintain traditional food habits; q avoid waste and large scale sale on black markets; q economize on scarce fuel; q avoid creation of new tastes; q avoid dependency on external food resources; q avoid disruption of local markets. 2. Local knowledge on each emergency situation will be the basis for the establishment of the food ration. Together with the National Society, a comprehensive survey should be carried out to ascertain the present nutritional status of the affected population, and if possible, the previous level, as well as to establish food requirements suitable in both type and amount. Other local relevant agencies should always be consulted and contact should be established with local nutritional expertise. 3. The ICRC/League action, and the food that it will provide, will be determined by consideration of needs (as determined above) and the action of other agencies."
