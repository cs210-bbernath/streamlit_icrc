"(distribution points are too far away from users), or if it does not accord with local sociocultural habits, it will not be used. 39 ''When water is available within about 1 km or within half-an-hour's return journey of the home, water use does not significantly increase when the distance or time is reduced, unless it is less than 100 m. When the point is reached where a tap can be provided within each house, water use may increase dramatically from 10-30 l to 30-100 l/person.''

Systems that are supplied ready-made, without community involvement, are doomed to failure owing to lack of interest, insufficient motivation to insure maintenance, and, in the short term, lack of use."
