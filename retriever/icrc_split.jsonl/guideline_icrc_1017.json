"proportion of children in this age group is approximately 15%. If the total number of tents is 4,000, and the total camp population is 20,000, then the number of children corresponding to the criteria is approximately 3,000 (N), i.e. 0.75 children per tent. If the sample size is 350 (n), then 466.7 tents (350 / 0.75) must be visited (rounded up to 467). The interval size is 4,000 / 467 = 8.57 tents, rounded down to 8. The fi rst tent is selected randomly between 1 and 8, and sampling continues by selecting every eighth tent thereafter. If the proportion of children between 6 and 59 months accommodated in each tent is unclear, it is best to conduct a pilot study into thirty or so tents in order to document this important aspect of the survey in terms of the interval size. Systematic sampling is illustrated in Figure 10.7 in which the interval size is 5, and the randomly selected fi rst tent is number 3."
