"have access to refrigeration and, since they will be loath to dispose of a half-consumed tin of evaporated or condensed milk or the remains of an undrunk cup of reconstituted milk powder, these are likely to become real health hazards. # Dilution Children whose main source of food is over-diluted milk powder will inevitably become malnourished. Children who are constantly fed under-diluted milk powder can become dangerously ill as a result of the high concentration of salt. When powdered milks are distributed from large sacks it is unlikely that the recipients receive proper guidance on dilution. Such instructions are not even always written on the sacks. Instructions, written on tins of milk powder are often in an unknown language or otherwise unintelligible. Different brands/types of milk powder require different dilutions of water to one part of powder by volume. Instructions (if any) given to the recipients are unlikely to be changed with different consignments of milk powder."
