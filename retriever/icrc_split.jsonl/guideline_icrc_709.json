"permit a distribution of intervention programs based on each agency's skills and resources. # Cooperation In the field, cooperation may manifest itself in the sharing of resources or services. Thus, the World Food Programme (WFP) often puts food supplies at the disposal of other organizations; similarly, the ICRC offers logistic assistance to facilitate the work of other agencies. # Contribution Some of the humanitarian organizations have no operational capacity. Their role is to provide other agencies with the financial, human, or logistic resources needed for a given operation. The United Nations Department for Humanitarian Affairs has suggested launching consolidated appeals incorporating all the demands of all the agencies for a given situation. This procedure involves obvious dangers. It slows down the intervention process in emergencies, limits the agencies' independence, and risks confusing the donors concerning the respective mandates of the agencies. # Coercion Contribution should not become a means of coercion."
