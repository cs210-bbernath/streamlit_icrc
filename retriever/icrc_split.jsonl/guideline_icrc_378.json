"education, etc.) and primary or secondary consultations. 39 The number of medical consultations (at the dispensary level) can be empirically estimated at four to six consultations (primary and secondary) per year and per person in a refugee camp, at least during the first three months of the relief operation. This figure should normally fall to two or three per year and per person. 40 This workload may be distributed differently depending on the degree to which ambulatory care (provided by CHW health stations, dispensaries, or local clinics) is decentralized. A study on refugee camps by the health ministry of Honduras showed that the average number of consultations per person and per year was 1.7 for refugees of Nicaraguan origin, 4.3 for refugees of Mosquito origin, and 3.9 for refugees of Salvadorian origin. The distribution of this workload between the community health workers and the health-care professionals (doctors and nurses) was respectively 18% for CHWs-Nicaragua, 51% for CHWs-Mosquito, and 53% for CHWs-Salvador. These are not absolute values, applicable under all circumstances."
