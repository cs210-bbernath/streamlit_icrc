"5, and sick people); 9 an increased need of nutrients (pregnant and breastfeeding women, individuals suffering from specifi c medical problems, particularly the wounded or patients that have undergone a major surgical operation). These cases suggest a specifi c vulnerability to malnutrition, which SFPs aim to confront, prevent or remove altogether. When intended to confront vulnerability, SFPs are curative and target slightly or moderately malnourished individuals (i.e. targeted SFPs). When aimed at avoiding or removing vulnerability altogether, they are preventive, and directed towards the exposed group as a whole (non-targeted or blanket SFPs). Moreover, both types should serve to reduce morbidity and mortality, specifi cally by acting on the interaction between malnutrition and infection. However, no SFP can address the primary causes of malnutrition; this can only be achieved through GFDs, or economic, water and habitat, and health rehabilitation -all of which are priority programmes in crises. SFPs are thus essentially palliative in nature, and doomed to failure should the situation deteriorate in the absence of corrective steps."
