"this represents a cooked food volume of roughly 800 ml, to be fed in fi ve meals at least. The addition of oil up to 30% of the energy intake that completes breastfeeding reduces this volume to approximately 550 ml -this amount can be ingested easily in four meals. In the case of potato-legume blends, in which the potato content accounts for 75% of the calorie intake, the total volume is 1.2 litres, which should consequently be spread over eight meals. The substitution of part of the potato content with oil up to 30% of the calorie intake that completes breastfeeding reduces the total volume to approximately 800 ml, which can be fed in fi ve meals. The energy density and the frequency of meals can therefore be adjusted to feed infants. However, the administration of four to fi ve meals of approximately 150 ml each is time-consuming for the mother: at least one hour is needed to feed the child,"
