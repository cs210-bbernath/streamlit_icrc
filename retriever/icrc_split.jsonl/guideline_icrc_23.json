"4. If a Ministry of Health agent can be assigned to the health post from a centre or a hospital: mode of action = persuasion. Each activity must be regularly reviewed in the light of the corresponding mode of action, bearing in mind that preference must be given to the mode of action that involves the least substitution possible. The figure shows the activities relating to each pathology. MHUs are not an appropriate strategy for treating patients during the acute stage of their illness. This is made abundantly clear in the literature. The literature demonstrates the value of the MHU strategy for vaccination or screening (for serious/fatal conditions which are slow to develop). The various services provided by an MHU may be compared to a capsule. The outer casing is attractive and brightly coloured, and conceals the active principle. In our comparison, the active principle is vaccination 70 and the whole range of health promotion and preventive activities."
