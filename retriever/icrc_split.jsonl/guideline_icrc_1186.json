"and they are still under considerable scrutiny (Scrimshaw, 1996); the rations defi ned for planning purposes (known as planning rations) are therefore likely to be adjusted further in coming years. However, the search for more accuracy must be compatible with fi eld reality, which is subject to great variability. The smaller the corrections are, the less impact and meaning they really have. Moreover, the defi nition of rations for planning purposes is highly theoretical, and must not necessarily refl ect a specifi c reality. Realistic planning rations is a contradiction in terms, as are rations that correspond exactly to the needs of target groups. The corollary of these remarks is that agencies must secure the means for adjusting planning rations to reality as closely as possible. This implies the introduction of monitoring systems to follow up general distribution.
