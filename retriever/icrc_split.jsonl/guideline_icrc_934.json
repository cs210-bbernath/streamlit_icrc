"biological utilization of food; 5 These aspects may be illustrated by the following example. In 1997, the El Ni\u00f1o climatic phenomenon was conjectured to cause an unprecedented drought in Irian Jaya, resulting in the risk of famine. This signal prompted a preliminary appraisal. The situation analysis involved theoretical research into the region, its climate, its inhabitants and their living conditions, and the factors that may infl uence the assessment itself. This research revealed that, drought notwithstanding, some areas could experience signifi cant rainfall. The terrain was extremely diffi cult, access to villages required the use of helicopters. The population relied almost entirely on the cultivation of sweet potato and gathering. Its access to healthcare was virtually nonexistent, malaria was endemic, and interpreters were indispensable. This information provided the basis to prepare the necessary fi eld equipment and perfect the understanding of the cultivation and food value of sweet potato. Logistics being signifi cantly restricted, it was clear from the onset that any assistance operation would meet with substantial constraints."
