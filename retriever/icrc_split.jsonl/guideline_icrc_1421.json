"malnutrition would justify the opening of one or several SFP centres; on the other hand, if the population is small and scattered, even high malnutrition rates may not necessarily be conclusive. Furthermore, the objective of the SFP is also the deciding factor: if the purpose is to contain a crisis, one can begin with twenty benefi ciaries, while preparing to accommodate a thousand in the coming months. If it is to provide a safety net, one can also begin with a few dozens, for instance by linking the SFP centre with a health facility or paediatric service. The number of benefi ciaries of an SFP centre varies greatly, and is contingent upon the available resources and infrastructure. It can range between 50 to 1,500 without posing major problems, provided the resources are adequate. Depending on the access to the population and its degree of concentration, it may be preferable to open several centres -or just one. # PROGRAMME EXIT CRITERIA As in any other humanitarian intervention,"
