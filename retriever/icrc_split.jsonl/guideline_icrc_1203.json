"planned. In prisons for example, intakes can sometimes be easily controlled, and fi eld workers can set deadlines for the BMI of inmates to reach an acceptable level; the results are then observed and compared with the initial objective. The same type of calculation may be applied to malnourished groups assisted through GFD. The catchup component must then be defi ned. If, as indicated above, the catch-up of 1 g of tissue involves the consumption of 5 kcal, and one gram of tissue contains approximately 16% of protein, then 0.2 g of protein must be supplied (of which approximately 80% will be used), in addition to the 5 kcal. Clearly, catch-up ingredients must include both macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients. In terms of macro-nutrients for example, if an adult is to catch up 5 g of weight per kilo and per day, and initially weighs 45 kg, then approximately 1,500 kcal (6,270 kJ) and 34 g of protein for maintenance, plus 1,125 kcal (4,700 kJ)"
