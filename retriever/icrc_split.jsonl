They may also restrict an entire population's access to its immediate environment.

This vulnerability translates into the requirement for external assistance, and assessment must document this properly. The key concept here is the \"requirement\" for assistance: all individuals and groups have basic needs, but do not necessarily require assistance to meet them. Moreover, requirements should not be confused with the victims' requests. 1 The requirement for assistance justifi es humanitarian action when existing services falter or fail.

It also indicates that the behaviour that consists in utilizing survival reserves threatens the household's economic self-suffi ciency. The response to the drought is here both insuffi cient and dangerous, and highlights the serious problems already encountered at the food securing stage, which will have consequences later in the feeding process.

Vulnerability can be reduced by increasing and protecting livelihoods and decreasing the degree of exposure to hazard.

Haemoglobin iron contributes to the transport of the oxygen required for the aerobic production of energy. Haemoglobin is contained in red blood cells; the life span of these cells is short (some four months), and their constantly renewed synthesis causes signifi cant dependency on factors that may inhibit their synthesis or that of haemoglobin.

The accumulation of these metabolites appears to cause the dilatation of peripheral blood vessels, resulting in vasodilatation. At this stage, fl uid is leaking from capillary vessels, resulting in the formation of oedemas. Vasodilatation also causes an increase of the cardiac function in order to maintain blood circulation.

Assessment in crisis must therefore question what may appear normal as well as apparent abnormalities. \n\n# The biological utilization of food\nProblems arise here from an insuffi cient food intake and poor health.

Although this method is very ''technocratic,'' it provides the framework for a number of questions which delineate the ethical issues. \n# Selecting the Program's Target Population\n\n# Access restricted to certain population groups\nSelecting the target population may pose problems. What should be done, for example, if access is limited to certain geographical areas? The options are:\n. to meet the needs of the populations living in these areas;\n.", "activities. The limits of this proceeding are known and accepted. In contrast, screening for positive TB cases without preparing to treat them is a step that merits careful thought.

Not only does the disease continue its course, but this practice is likely to increase resistance to antibiotics. \n# Emergency Activities and Respect for Local Norms\nAnother problem is what to do when the humanitarian organization is certain that the local norms do not match those generally recognized as effective.", "is in fact achieving its objectives with the expected impact. \n# Monitoring\nMonitoring serves to confi rm that planned activities are being implemented according to set standards; it also permits the analysis of admissions and discharges, and of attendance at mealtimes and treatment sessions. Monitoring should also provide information as to developments in the living conditions outside the TFC, and as to the factors that infl uence them.

For example, in the UNICEF manual Assisting in Emergencies, supplementary feeding is defined as:\n''the need...to ensure that young and moderately malnourished children, pregnant and lactating women receive adequate and suitable food  The best strategy for ensuring appropriate food for these 'vulnerable groups' must be decided locally in each case on the basis of a thorough assessment of the causes of their nutritional vulnerability and the practical possibilities for reducing that vulnerability.'' 64 More specifically, the procedure is described thus:\n''Additional food is given to selected, nutritionally vulnerable individuals to compensate for specific deficiencies -in energy, protein, vitamins and mineralsin the food otherwise available to them.", "conditions affect the quantities of water that can be provided. Obviously, in desert regions where water is scarce and therefore precious, it will be doled out parsimoniously, or at least according to the minimum standards. Finally, the technical characteristics of the water distribution network influence the quantities of water used by a population. Many studies on such factors as the distances between water-supply points and the consumer's home have shown a relation between the quantity of water used and the distance the user needs to go to fetch it.

In Egypt, for example, when a campaign was launched to introduce ORT, a systematic surveillance program for dehydration cases seen in the dispensaries revealed a high rate of hypernatremia. A media-based education program corrected this misuse of ORT. 45 Every program should be evaluated.

One difference, however, is that in emergency situations, results are expected within a couple of weeks, while results from PHC are part of the strategy of ''health for all by the year 2000.''\nA second difference lies in the population's preliminary involvement in selecting the intervention programs. Taking the ''wants/needs'' formulated by the population into account is imperative in the framework of PHC, whereas in emergency situations, health measures are usually imposed by humanitarian agencies. On occasion, however, a synthesis of the two different approaches may be possible. Emergency actions may then be considered as a group of specific interventions which, despite everything, are coordinated to a certain degree.", "or not; -treatment of the groups most susceptible to infection. Mass treatment is justified if the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections is very high -for example, 60-70% for ascariasis.

In the first place, although the onset of serious food crises can be predicted, usually it is not until the media become interested that the authorities concerned -local, national, and international -go into action. The second difficulty is that sending food aid in a crisis does not solve the underlying problem. Its roots often lie in preexisting underdevelopment; the current crisis, latching onto it, only emphasizes economic, sociocultural, and political structural inadequacies. The benevolent approach of food aid which has predominated up to now should be completely revised in favor of a preventive approach designed to correct structural inadequacies.", "patients have progressed into rehabilitation, usually one week after admission. 32\n\n# Scabies\nScabies is a parasite skin infection that causes rashes and intense itching.

But such solutions are not easy to implement, and may even prove unrealistic, owing to the diffi culty of targeting and setting thresholds between recipient categories. \n# Interaction with local authorities\nUnless humanitarian action combines with military intervention (on the basis of the right to interfere as defi ned by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Revel, 1979), it has little chance of imposing views on local or national authorities.", "vitamins, which can be supplied in the form of tablets.

As such, it enhances the overall consistency of an operation in the fi elds of economics, representation for the respect of rights, water and habitat, and access to healthcare. This comment underscores the close connection between the different measures required in a crisis. In a famine, for example, a GFD may be an indispensable prerequisite for a therapeutic feeding programme, but it may also call for indispensable accompanying measures such as the provision of inputs to prepare food (e.g. milling facilities, fuel, cooking utensils), access to safe drinking water, and access to other goods and services essential for survival.", "perspective aiming at the eventual restoration of the original systems. \n# Rehabilitation as a Form of Emergency Intervention\nIf the link between the victims and the local systems still exists, and the dysfunction of the latter is linked to material supply problems or a temporary lack of personnel, as may be the case for hospitals and water supply stations, for example, then an intervention to rehabilitate the local systems will be e n o u g h t o s o l v e t h e problem.

GFD is understood in contrast to supplementary feeding, which targets individuals with specifi c conditions rather than households, as discussed in Chapter XIV. The specifi c conditions that justify supplementary feeding relate to physiological vulnerability (for example, the malnourished, pre-school children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, the elderly and the sick) or environmental vulnerability (that is, associated with living conditions -for example in hospitals, orphanages, asylums, homes for the elderly, and prisons).", "child, and with the adequate medical follow-up of the child.

Prevention-oriented programs are generally more unwieldy than curative ones, and there is no need to wait until all the preventive measures have been instituted before beginning to plan and implement curative programs.

The absence of both food reserves and the financial means to buy the food they need makes them very vulnerable to climatic vagaries.

The latter is crucial in emergency situations, when safe water must be obtained quickly. The process of assessment must take all these criteria into account. Ready-made assessment forms are available for this purpose. 17 \n\n# Selecting a Source of Water\nMerely filling out an assessment form does not in itself solve the problem of choosing a water source, especially where various options exist.", "displacements, or restrictions on access to food or medical services.

The philosophical bedrock of humanitarian ethics is expressed in the three fi rst principles of the International Movement of the Red Cross and Red Crescent (Fundamental Principles, 1993):\n\n# \"Humanity\nThe Movement, born of a desire to bring assistance without discrimination to the wounded on the battlefi eld, endeavours -in its international and national capacity -to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found.", "to give the greatest number of people access to care. \n# Tertiary\n\n# Level: hospitals\nSecondary Level:\n- health centers - dispensaries Primary Level: - community - family unit C O M P L E X I T Y O F C A R E D E C E N T R A L I Z A T I O N O F C A R E\nDo the care providers have the skills to treat the problems that arise?

The rate of abandonment depends not only on the length of treatment, but also on economic factors (access to medicine) and sociocultural factors (whether the patient belongs to a nomadic or resident population). Another aspect to be considered in tuberculosis is how quickly the treatment makes the patient's sputum negative. On average, after eight weeks of the short treatment the percentage of patients with negative sputum is 99%, while it is only 45-50% after eight weeks of traditional therapy. This is a key factor in a displaced-persons camp, where the reduction of transmission is a priority.", "when necessary, by taking the responsibility for the full ration. Whether wholly or partly responsible for the basic ration, the Red Cross must ensure that there is an adequate basic ration for all family members. This basic ration must take into consideration the many factors, which may affect the nutritional requirements of different communities. It must be calculated so that it enables the population to sustain reasonable activity as well as normal growth and should also allow a margin for nutritional rehabilitation.

Interviewers must remain courteous in all circumstances, must never lose their temper because there is no excuse for rudeness and, besides, the image of the agency and, sometimes, even personal safety is at stake. \n# Observation\nDirect observation consists in examining the environment, which is usually the source of invaluable information. The systematic observation of the indicators selected for assessment (such as the condition of crops, the methods of waste disposal, or the water supply) is simple. However, the more permanent, informal observation that amounts to \"reading the environment\" is a different matter: it is an investigation method in its own right, which may seem self-evident but demands experience and alertness.", "are there to help the cardholder transport the distributed goods. 34 The extent of required attendance is also determined by the other types of activity that may be conducted at the same time as the GFD, such as child vaccination, nutritional measurement, or vitamin A supplementation. What matters here is that the modalities of the distribution and, in particular, its associated attendance requirements be made clear beforehand. \n# Material required of benefi ciaries\nIn principle, distributing agencies do not supply the material required for carrying assistance items away. Recipients must therefore be told clearly what type of material they must bring to the distribution; however, distributing agencies must always keep some packing material for the completely destitute, but this must however remain the exception.", "and it is thus impossible to set an arbitrary standard.

Such practices are those usually addressed in so-called \"nutritional education programmes\"; however, the expression \"information\" is considered more appropriate than \"education\", and is preferred here accordingly. The term \"education\" is misleading in humanitarian action, as it suggests that the victims owe their sufferings partly to their ignorance. In actual fact, ignorance and lack of access to education are never the causes of major humanitarian crisis; such crises arise from inadequate protection and resources.", "living in a given situation must therefore be defi ned. This defi nition results in two profi les: one applies to economically developed countries, and the other to underdeveloped or developing countries. These two profi les are provided in Table 12.2 below. \n# Average weight per age and sex group\nThe population must be divided into age and sex groups, because these groups correspond to different average weights, and because basal metabolisms differ according to weight and sex. What matters here is the average weight per group or stratum, and it may differ signifi cantly between populations of adolescents and adults.", "retrospective analysis (present and future) of disorders and their causes. The subsequent planning consists in defi ning operational proposals based upon the necessary priorities; these proposals must combine the need for assistance, the opportunities, and the constraints in a realistic programme. These objectives fall within the framework of the preliminary appraisal process as illustrated in Figure 10.2 below. \n\n# The methodology of preliminary appraisal\nThe implementation of a preliminary appraisal follows the seven stages illustrated in Figure 10.2 above, in which each stage has its own justifi cation and methodology. \n# Situation analysis\nSituation analysis consists in conducting a more or less formal pilot assessment, with a twofold objective.", "''Starvation of civilians as a method of combat is prohibited. It is therefore prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless, for that purpose, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works.'' 15\nThese rules are particularly important for health-care personnel in their efforts to protect and assist war victims. International human rights law directly concerns individuals and applies mostly to the individual's relations with the State.

The completion of the exchange of matter and energy between the organism and its environment through the feeding process satisfi es the nutritional need. For the feeding process to be effi cient, all its activities must provide suffi cient performance, according to biological and cultural determinism. In line with the three stages described in Chapter VI (the securing of food, its consumption, and its biological utilization), all the required means must therefore be available and utilized according to the standards that enable the covering of the need.", "if the population is to derive maximal benefit from them. 16 Curative Programs\nThe interaction of curative programs is a concept familiar to health-care personnel. Medical services are constituted by facilities for ambulatory care and facilities for hospital care, with a communication network (ambulances) between them. Once the most urgent medical problems have been defined, a decision must be made as to what level of the health-care system will treat these problems. This implies that the exact skills of the health-care personnel at each level are known, including those of any community health workers. 17 Delegating standardized tasks on the basis of skills is an essential integrational activity at the beginning of an intervention.", "sustained interaction, which is often utopian in times of crisis. In addition to targeting, the second challenge lies in the defi nition of selection criteria that are practical and unambiguous. This may generate a technical problem whose magnitude grows with diminishing vulnerability levels and rising numbers of individuals in the critical bracket. The local population and its leaders should participate in the identifi cation of those who require assistance as a priority. But the seriousness of the situation and its potential for deterioration may complicate participation to the point of causing more problems than it resolves. The cost of targeting in terms of time and personnel must also be allowed for; if the identifi cation of recipient households absorbs all available resources, the effort can be counter-productive.", "the benefi ciary is indeed receiving his/her share at home. This of course is illusory when the entire population's access to food is clearly insuffi cient. \n# Take-away rations\nFor take-away rations, pre-mix is desirable. This can be either commercial or locally prepared (as described in Section 2.3.1 above) for mothers, properly trained, to cook at home. This is the safest way of ensuring that the child will eat most of its ration. Individual ingredients or biscuits should not be distributed, as they would likely be eaten by others.

Domestic garbage and waste water should be removed from the kitchen as quickly as possible, to distant locations intended for this use, and which inhibit vector proliferation (fl ies and mosquitoes). Leftovers can be recycled as compost or fed to animals, but the latter must not be admitted to the kitchens. \n# Personal hygiene\nIn terms of personal hygiene, hands must be washed with water and soap, and dried with an immaculate towel or else air-dried.", "any reservoir system. The final result is an ecological disaster. This disaster, in turn, will endanger those crops sensitive to lack of water, reducing agricultural production 42 and thereby giving rise to an agricultural disaster. The drop in agricultural yield will affect the economically vulnerable groups, 43 who will have trouble obtaining food. These problems will be all the more serious if the society in which they occur has a vulnerable social structure (dysfunction of traditional mechanisms of mutual aid, families broken up by war, a displaced population which is not socially 41 An absence of vegetation encourages water to run off on the soil surface directly to rivers and streams, without seeping down to the water table.", "these groups de facto lack access to a balanced diet). \n# The development of defi ciency and symptoms\nWhere the diet consists entirely of maize, clinical signs appear within 50 to 60 days (Machlin, 1984). This timeframe has been determined in experimentation. In humanitarian practice, it is however often diffi cult to determine the former diet of a population facing nutritional crisis. As a result, if niacin defi ciency is suspected but not yet obvious, it should be addressed before the appearance of clinical signs -in the case of pellagra, these usually consist of the four \"Ds\": dermatosis, diarrhoea, dementia, and death, but this is not always borne out by reality.", "Indicators Health indicators are selected according to the following criteria.  The indicator can be precisely defined. \n# The indicator can be analyzed in relation to other parameters. A test is available for the effective measurement of the indicator. \n# Relevance to the Factors to Be Measured\nIn situations where access to food is cut off, the rate of severe malnutrition should be measured as a way of assessing the urgency of the nutritional situation.

The benefi ciaries cannot prepare their own meals because they lack the necessary space or material (such as cooking utensils and fuel). The provision of fuel is a major problem in GFD, and can cause widespread environmental damage because humanitarian agencies tend to neglect this fundamental aspect.

It is intended to be in addition to their normal share of household food, including any general emergency distributions.'' 65 The World Health Organization (WHO) manual The Management of Nutritional Emergencies in Large Populations defines the purpose of supplementary feeding as:\n''to supplement deficiencies in energy and/or nutrients, especially protein, in the basic diet of those most vulnerable to malnutrition: children under 5, pregnant or lactating women, medical cases, old people, children selected by a screening method.'' 66 The first definition equates supplementary feeding with nutritional rehabilitation. It is true that in some cases the strategy used to deal with the problem of moderate malnutrition will be the distribution of supplementary rations in addition to the general ration.", "and cow's milk clearly reveals the advantages of maternal milk. 9 Energy: cow's milk and maternal milk share roughly the same energy content, but their energy density gradient is not the same. 9 Protein: cow's milk contains close to three times more protein than human milk does -this raises the urea plasma concentration beyond the norm and causes kidney overload. Moreover, cow's milk protein is less digestible than maternal milk protein. 9 Lipids: maternal milk lipids are more easily absorbed than those of cow's milk. 9 Glucides: the higher lactose content of maternal milk promotes the development of a specifi c intestinal fl ora that increases the acidity of the medium and inhibits the growth of pathogenic germs.", "realistically -to limit their use, by means of precise rules.

Health-care personnel working in the framework of humanitarian operations are not, of course, responsible for seeking political solutions to this problem. But it is clearly incumbent on them to point out, indeed, to denounce, the consequences of mine use to the political, military, and diplomatic authorities, and to sensitize the media to the problem. \n# Preventing Population Migrations\nIn situations of armed conflict, respect for the rules of international humanitarian law will prevent entire populations from having to flee their homeland.", "facilities are unable to meet the needs of the population. What should be done? Stick to the principle of proportionality? Help each side equally? Assist according to need and publish ''good conduct'' reports for the party that meets its responsibilities?

In this respect, donors like to engage directly with fi eld staff in charge of assessments and distributions proper.

These products have only a temporary effect unless they are accompanied by the measures mentioned above. Moreover, their use may be detrimental:\n-to the health of those who handle them; -to the health of beneficiaries, if the rules concerning the concentration to be used, the mode of delivery, etc., are not respected; -to long-term vector control, since in the long term improper use may lead to the development of resistant vector strains, as was the case with anopheles and DDT.", "constructing this type of latrine are described in many sources.

Transport within a country is generally by means of trucks.", "satisfying the victims' immediate needs while still maintaining ethical principles. \n# Strategy and Violations of International Humanitarian Law\nConfronted with violations of international humanitarian law, humanitarian agencies have a choice of two strategies which, although apparently contradictory, are in fact complementary. One involves appealing to international public opinion, while the other employs discretion in bilateral negotiations with the responsible authorities. The strategy of denouncing violations of international humanitarian law is meant to alert governments and the international community in general to the difficulties humanitarian agencies face in the normal performance of their work. The danger of this strategy, as mentioned above, is that it can harden the attitudes of the authorities responsible for blocking access to the victims; this may affect other vulnerable groups who already benefit from the presence of humanitarian agencies.", "food aid; nevertheless, relief workers should know that it exists. Generally speaking, when a food problem arises during an emergency, the entire socioeconomic system should be analyzed before a decision can be made regarding the appropriateness of distributing food. An early-warning system based on this type of analysis would permit preventive intervention well before the populations suffering from armed conflict or other disasters reached a significant level of malnutrition. Food aid is a complex issue for several reasons, notably:\n. It affects the economic, social (including social and health-care organization), and political systems. . In conflict situations, food aid has a strong political connotation (the risk of ''feeding the enemy'') which tends to paralyze its implementation.", "drug use, and the principal humanitarian agencies accept WHO's recommendations. 25 Lists of essential drugs, reflecting both the medical problems themselves and the different treatment levels, already exist:\n& the WHO/UNHCR list of essential drugs; & the ICRC list of essential drugs; & the MSF (Me\u00b4decins sans Frontie`res) list of essential drugs. This rationalization must take into account four factors:\n1. The population's health problems rather than the wishes of the medical teams. 2.

The impact of such attacks is proportional to their force and to the degree of vulnerability; it also undermines the means to cover basic needs, either by infl ating these needs, or by undermining the means to cover them. Excessive imbalance results between the needs and the means for survival. The only possible response is then abnormal, because the means are insuffi cient, or because their utilization is hazardous (for example, selling the family plough). If the means are lacking or are insuffi cient, crisis can result in disaster. The observation or prospect of this response justifi es humanitarian attention.", "known to the disaster response community prior to the disaster. They should authorize relief personnel to utilize all means of communication required for their relief operations. 4. Governments should seek to provide a coordinated disaster information and planning service: the overall planning and coordination of relief efforts is ultimately the responsibility of the host government. Planning and coordination can be greatly enhanced if NGHAs are provided with information on relief needs and government systems for planning and implementing relief efforts as well as information on potential security risks they may encounter. Governments are urged to provide such information to NGHAs. To facilitate effective coordination and the effi cient utilization of relief efforts, host governments are urged to designate, prior to disaster, a single point-of-contact for incoming NGHAs to liaise with the national authorities.", "average level of physical activity; 9 the average ambient temperature. The defi nition of standard conditions facilitates the defi nition of reference rations for planning purposes, as described earlier. Rations may need to be adjusted to the above factors, and this may involve their increase or reduction. In settings where the above factors are familiar and well understood, such adjustments may already be made during the planning phase. Two additional factors may call for ration increase: nutritional catch-up and post-distribution losses. \n# Nutritional catch-up\nNutritional catch-up is costly. Weight gain of 1 g of tissue that contains an average of 16% of protein and 25% of lipids involves in the process a consumption of approximately 5 kcal (21 kJ) (WHO, 1985 andWaterlow, 1982).", "regions where subjects are geographically distributed (this facilitates their location). 9 Cluster random sampling is recommended for large, scattered populations that may not be homogenous, without it being possible or necessary to defi ne more homogenous sub-groups. \n# Sample size\nThe underlying principle here is that, whatever the issue under investigation, the size of the population from which the sample is taken is infi nite. As a result, the size of the sample is not determined by the size of the population. Exceptions exist, in the case of small groups whose size is well known; in such cases, the sample size may be recalculated (see below).", "that the problem is in the process of being solved. In making choices, then, health-care personnel must be able to examine the issue in ethical terms, balancing the choices made on the basis of the victims' needs against those reflecting the humanitarian agencies' interests. \n# Emergency Strategy and Development\nThe concept of preventing problems at their source indirectly poses the issue of integrating a developmental dynamic into emergency operations. It is often unrealistic to try to link an emergency operation with development in situations of armed conflict; peace is essential to development.

It may be necessary to target groups that are especially vulnerable or, where this is not possible, to set ration levels that satisfy the need for assistance as effectively as possible. This however implies that some will receive too much, and others too little; the latter may require additional safety measures such as the establishment of supplementary and therapeutic feeding centres in order to treat moderate and severe malnutrition. 9 Coping mechanisms and the economic potential of available resources can be diffi cult to appraise, and may be unclear if target groups are still at the stage of exploring available opportunities.", "the resident population reconstructions of the residents' original homes . prefabricated dwellings\n\n# Energy Resources\nEnergy may be obtained from:\n. wood . \n# charcoal\n\n# electricity\n\n# gas\nthe sun (solar energy)\n\n# Selection Criteria\nThe criteria for choosing between these various solutions are given below.

In some circumstances however, GFD must be terminated earlier because unexpected negative effects have appeared, because security conditions no longer permit its continuation, or because monitoring and evaluation have revealed new parameters that require a thorough review of the rationale underlying the current GFD. \n# FOOD STORAGE\nFood storage is an important aspect of GFD in order to ensure food quality and appropriate management. The storage space or warehouse must be sheltered from the elements, and must therefore be structurally sound. In particular, its roofi ng must be adequate, its fl oor must be high enough to limit the risk of fl ooding, it must be well-ventilated and offer the least possible refuge to rodents and other pests.", "adolescents, and a BMI 6 inferior to 14 for adults.

Clearly, the more local counterparts are supported, the greater the responsibility for providing them with the means to pursue this effort beyond the duration of the operation at hand.

Owing to a lack of immediate care, such diseases as meningitis and cerebral malaria are likely to prove fatal. The combination of prevalence and seriousness leads to high mortality.

Finally, ethics concerning victims consists in voicing their concerns to the relevant authorities or forces, and to international opinion. Authorities must be reminded of their responsibilities, and encouraged to abide by their duty towards the population. As discussed previously, however, representations 18 and direct assistance may contradict. If the authorities lack both the means and the intention of abiding by their responsibilities, then no assistance is delivered, and victims pay the price.

Consequently, every population, or at least every population group, must define its own development, based on its own conception of human rights.

Effects can never be predicted with complete confi dence, and their evolution must therefore be carefully monitored during the operation proper. The best way of dealing with predictable negative effects is to engage in dialogue with local stakeholders to secure their acceptance and support -bearing in mind that most (such as victims, benefi ciaries, authorities, organized criminals, and locals) know perfectly well how humanitarian agencies operate, and how to profi t from their presence. \n# ETHICS CONCERNING VICTIMS\nAn ethical approach to victims consists mainly in preventing and alleviating suffering.", "cash income, and assets such as savings, livestock, land, etc.). \n# The household economy approach\nThe household economy approach aims to study if and how households manage to cover their essential and non-essential needs. Ultimately, it shows whether or not a given population is economically insecure and therefore in need of assistance. It is done by comparing a normal, baseline year (reflecting the usual conditions when the population is able to cover its essential needs) and the year in question, especially after a crisis or shock. The comparison makes it possible to determine if the population is worse, the same or better off than in the past.", "Are we setting out to treat acute or chronic diseases? Will the beneficiaries be free to attend? (Work in the fields, seasonal constraints, market days, etc.)\nThe main intrinsic constraint affecting MHUs is the temporary nature of the care they dispense: \"The mobile teams move on, the patient remains!\" Although evaluation of the zone enables us to document the causes of mortality and morbidity and therefore to determine the activities to be conducted, the feasibility of those activities depends on security and logistical factors.

Nonetheless, the implementation of preventive measures (immunization, health education, hygiene measures) still requires a decentralized approach. \n# Coordination between Health-Related Systems\nAs shown, health depends only partially on the health-care services. Other factors, such as agriculture, environment, and social structures, are also strong influences. In an emergency situation, the concept of health-related systems is replaced by the more specific one of programs for feeding and nutrition, water, environmental hygiene, and the like. \n# Prevention Programs\nIn each of the areas discussed below (nutrition, environmental hygiene, prevention), aid organizations may establish programs with a specific objective, defined by the target population they are trying to cover (children under five, pregnant women, etc.) and by the high selectivity of the intervention.", "of the armed con ict and other situations of violence.

This very simple approach also yields good results, especially if kitchens are located close to a health centre where patients can go independently for care.  \n\n# BACKGROUND TO SFPS\nSFPs have evolved within the public health programmes of developing countries to address stable situations. They were initially intended to promote the nutritional recovery of moderately and slightly malnourished children, as well as preventing a deterioration of the nutritional status in specifi c circumstances: poverty, weaning, or an unfavourable environment, conducive to infectious diseasewhose possible impact on the nutritional status has been discussed above.", "under satisfactory conditions of shelter, hygiene, health, safety and nutrition. Keeping civilian populations in their normal environment depends on such factors as security conditions and the scope of ''military necessity.'' Finally, if the civilian population remains on its home ground, its means of subsistence must be protected. Here again, health-care personnel can turn to legal instruments. \n# Protection of Means of Subsistence\nArticle 14 of Protocol II guarantees the protection of goods indispensable to survival:\n''Starvation of civilians as a method of combat is prohibited. It is therefore prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless, for that purpose, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works.'' This article is clear.", "dysfunctional food system where families' basic needs are not covered. Such children will inevitably slip back into their previous malnourished condition, with its attendant risk of death. 47 The second common error is not to plan for a long-term solution based on selfsufficiency for a population that has already benefited from assistance. Developing a long-term strategy is not an immediate concern in the initial phase of an emergency. But it should be borne in mind that the longer direct food aid is continued (in the form of food distribution), the weaker the likelihood that the assisted population can be made self-sufficient.", "thus complicating the issuing of recommendations as to weight gain. As an example, if a child weighing 10 kg upon admission must gain 2 kg in the centre, with a 700 kcal supplementary daily ration, it will gain approximately 14 g per kilogramme per day if the ration is used strictly for recovery (i.e. assuming it is receiving an adequate ration at home). At a recovery rate of 14 grammes per kilogramme per day, it will need approximately two weeks to gain 2 kg.

Moderate malnutrition can be assessed through mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), MUAC-for-height, or weight-for-height. As noted by Briend, mid-upper arm circumference provides a better indicator of mortality risk than weight-for-height (Briend, 1995). 14 Mid-upper arm circumference can be used alone to select benefi ciaries; it is faster but less accurate than MUAC-for-height.", "with disseminated malnutrition that is usually secondary, and targets individuals. In paediatric services especially, severe malnutrition usually affects subjects that are already vulnerable to sickness in normal living conditions in terms of their physiology.

The hospital approach requires well-defi ned means and skills that are virtually impossible to deploy together in humanitarian action. Hospital facilities must also deal with social problems and/or endemic poverty, which humanitarian prevention programmes cannot easily address.

They are then given a consultation in order to direct them to the person who is best able to look after them. In practice, most patients belong to this category. 3.

The application of intakes recommended by Latham for adults in developing countries (Latham, 1997) to the WHO 2 ration provided in Table 12.2 above results in a ration of 2,243 kcal (9,375 kJ) that can be rounded up to 2,250 kcal (9,400 kJ).", "its traditional leaders, who help to enforce organization and order. The population reports as families, with the mother of the children registered as family head, and the husband with his fi rst wife in case of polygamy. Once the queues are established and orderly, two procedures may be followed. 1. The population is ushered, one family at a time, 30 to a table where last names and the number of family members are recorded in a ledger, in addition to a varying number of details (such as age, fi rst names, and vaccination details); 31 family heads (it is usually preferable for mothers to be considered as such) must be recorded in ledgers, and then receive cards that grant them access to the GFD.", "to visualize a space and how that space is occupied. Like graphs, maps are a common tool in humanitarian action. They usually show physical features such as overland routes, dwellings, administrative boundaries, infrastructure, waterways (hydrography) and relief. It is best to keep them as simple as possible for field use and to restrict them to those elements that are necessary. A map can be produced (either because an appropriate one does not exist or to suit specific purposes) by using a compass and a mile counter, or even just by observation. Figures 18,19,20 and 21 shows different sample maps. \n# Guidelines for assessment in emergencies 81\nAfter the field visit \n\n# Transect walk\nA transect walk involves walking through the community to observe the people, the surroundings and the resources.", "NG tube, at the rate indicated in Table 13.3 above. Rehydration is completed when the patient is no longer thirsty and passes urine. The possibility of over-hydration nevertheless warrants special attention: its signs are an increased respiratory rate, engorged jugular veins, or a distended abdomen. Over-hydration calls for the immediate suspension of the treatment. ReSoMal given to maintain hydration in the case of persisting diarrhoea must be administered in amounts that are equivalent to the volume of the stool, until diarrhoea stops. In case of persisting vomiting, ReSoMal must be administered by NG tube. As soon as the patient becomes alert and is willing to drink, larger amounts of ReSoMal may be administered, but at longer intervals: this is in order to avoid vomiting and an undue acceleration of the overall rehydration rate.", "professionalism of fi eld staff and the respect of procedures. \n# Professionalism\nThe professionalism expected of humanitarian staff comprises training and experience in the fi rst place. In addition, considerable tact and sensitivity are essential for these two aspects to be fully exploited in the fi eld. Sensitivity is a quality that combines courtesy and respect for local customs. In humanitarian operations, the concept reaches further: it is an instrument fundamental to establishing dialogue and securing acceptance, understanding problems and, ultimately, deserving respect. When locally available skills are inadequate, staff must be trained and coached in the fi eld, and this provides the advantage of real-life conditions.", "humanitarian crisis; such crises arise from inadequate protection and resources. Nutritional information usually addresses the mothers of small children because the latter suffer from crisis fi rst. Here again, however, an increase in infant mortality does not result from maternal ignorance, but rather from the deterioration of one or more of the following parameters that shape living conditions: 9 available economic resources; 9 the time that can be devoted to small children; 9 access to healthcare; 9 the quality of water and habitat; 9 physical and emotional wellbeing. Information as such is therefore not the priority (it in fact ranks last in the strategy); what matters is the restoration of decent living conditions.", "be classified by type, the major category being protein-energy malnutrition. This, in turn, encompasses two main groups:\ngrowth retardation (stunting) Stunting reflects an adaptation to environmental stresses such as moderate lack of food and various infections. Children whose growth has been stunted in this manner are of below-normal height. 70 acute malnutrition (wasting) Such malnutrition may be either moderate or severe, depending on the degree of wasting. The moderate forms are characterized by a perceptibly lower body weight than the norm for the person's height. The severe forms can be subdivided into three categories: -Marasmus -characterized by a substantial loss of fat and muscle mass -Kwashiorkor -characterized by the presence of edema -Marasmic kwashiorkor -a combination of the two.", "not to spill it on the edges of the latrine. 9 One or more garbage incinerators, especially for medical waste. Medical waste that cannot be incinerated must be disposed of separately. 9 Waste disposal systems or pits for the burying of garbage that cannot be incinerated or composted. Pits must be regularly covered in sand or soil, and disinfected with quicklime. 9 Waste water disposal systems. Latrines and incinerators must be located according to prevailing winds, in order to avoid discomfort from odours and fumes. Waste water from the kitchen may be disposed of through irrigation systems that supply gardens or plantations.", "benefi ciaries, external pressure on the staff, and food diversion. Here again, dialogue involving all stakeholders is of crucial importance, as is a strong working discipline. 9. The population must be informed widely and as early as possible of the programme in order to avoid unnecessary confusion and misunderstandings. The justifi cation for the programme, its admission criteria, and the criteria for its termination and the withdrawal of the operating agency deserve specifi c explanations. \n# Meals\nFull rations must be supplied in the form of two meals a day at least, preferably three, and obviously at set times, which must be observed by all kitchens involved in the programme (for example, 10:00 am and 3:00 pm, or 09:00 am, 1:00 pm and 5:00 pm).", "for each stakeholder, sized and positioned according to its importance/influence.

Practically speaking, if intake is set at 200 kcal (840 kJ)/kg/day with F-100 Formula, then 8 rations of 25 ml each of F-100 Formula/kg/day must be supplied. Circumstances may prevent this, especially in case of night-time security problems or curfews, and if the TFC cannot include a camp for the permanent accommodation of carers. Therefore, feeding should begin as early as possible in the morning and end as late as possible at night.", "conflict zones burying a filter box in the river bed. These methods are based on the principle of filtering water through soil, which will be studied later. Technological input can be quite substantial, depending on the case. . Spring Water A spring is in fact ground water that rises to the surface at a certain point. The water has thus been naturally filtered by the geological strata and is usually potable. The trick is to draw the water immediately at the spot where it emerges (known as the ''eye'' of the spring). Spring water which has flowed above ground for too long becomes surface water, and is very likely to be polluted."]
