"the method of operating the pump: -manually (hand pump) -by an external energy source, such as wind, electricity, or sun. The factors to be considered in this choice are as follows: 27 the temptation is to install powerful technical means to provide maximum flow. If, however, water reserves (for example, the ground water) have been overestimated -or not been taken into account at all -they are apt to be quickly exhausted, with repercussions not only for the population's health status, but also for the environment. # Water Storage Once the water has been drawn from its source, it can be put directly at the population's disposal or channeled into a storage unit from which it will be distributed. # Criteria Dictating the Use of a Storage Unit . Water Quality If the water is of poor quality (for example, water pumped directly from a river), it must be treated. For proper treatment, whatever the technique (filtration, chemical treatment), the water must be stored."
