"the wounded and sick under their care shall, subject to national law, be respected. 4. Subject to national law, no person engaged in medical activities may be penalized in any way for refusing or failing to give information concerning the wounded and sick who are, or who have been, under his care.'' Several points should be mentioned here: . Medical activities must conform to the rules of ethics. Medical personnel are bound to observe discretion, meaning both respect for medical confidentiality as such and an obligation not to inform on patients. Medical personnel act within the framework of national legislation, 23 although the principle of respecting national legislation may conflict with the principle of not informing. The prohibition on punishing someone performing a medical function for the mere fact of keeping quiet about the wounded and sick under his or her care is relative, since this measure depends on the national legislation. The protection of health-care personnel is intended to reinforce the protection of the wounded and sick."
