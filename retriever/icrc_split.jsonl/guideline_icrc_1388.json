"kcal (418 kJ) and 3 g of protein for 100 ml, with a P/E ratio of 11.6%. If the formula is made from separate ingredients, a pre-mix must be prepared fi rst by blending the milk powder, sugar, and vitamins and minerals homogeneously, and then adding the oil. This pre-mix can be kept for a few days in a clean, sealed container, it must however be mixed again before use. The milk is reconstituted by dissolving the pre-mix in hot, previously boiled water, whisking it in the process -it must be served immediately, as the oil tends to separate out. Care must be taken to complete the pre-mix up to the corresponding volume of milk: for example, pre-mix prepared for 50 litres of milk must be dissolved in 30 litres of water, and then completed up to a fi nal volume of 50 litres (the pre-mix must not be added to 50 litres of water, as the resulting solution would be too diluted). This involves calibrating cauldrons fi rst."
