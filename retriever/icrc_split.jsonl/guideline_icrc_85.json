"Crescent. # Assessment report For each assessment, compile a report structured according to the headings agreed within your delegation. The amount of detail included under each heading will depend on the circumstances of each assessment. It is important to present the conclusions of the assessment as clearly as possible. The use of a standard format helps readers to find information quickly. # Note Keep the assessment report as short as possible, but make sure no important information is omitted. The assessment team is not expected to produce a complete programme design. However, ideas from the team are extremely useful to programme planners. There are three possible conclusions from the assessment (see Vulnerability and capacity framework, Section 3): I There is no need for an intervention (the capacity of the affected population is sufficient to withstand the problems). I There is a need for intervention, but the Red Cross Red Crescent is not the appropriate agency to make this intervention."
