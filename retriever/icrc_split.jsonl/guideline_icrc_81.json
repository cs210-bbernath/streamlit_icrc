"confidence of all, the Movement may not take sides in hostilities or engage in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature. # Independence The Movement is independent. The National Societies, while auxiliaries in the humanitarian services of their governments and subject to the laws of their respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy so that they may be able at all times to act in accordance with the principles of the Movement. # Voluntary Service It is a voluntary relief movement not prompted in any manner by desire for gain. # Unity There can be only one Red Cross or Red Crescent Society in any one country. It must be open to all. It must carry on its humanitarian work throughout its territory. # Universality The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, in which all societies have equal status and share equal responsibilities and duties in helping each other, is worldwide."
