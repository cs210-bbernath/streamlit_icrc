"Seasonal calendars are a useful tool in rural environments where production varies throughout the year. They can reflect all significant events occurring during the year. Seasonal calendars should ideally be established for a period of 18 months, in order to reflect seasonal cross-over periods. Calendar design is usually based on a normal year, thus facilitating the subsequent deduction of deviances observed during assessment. Whatever the ultimate approach, calendars must indicate the reference year. It is best for seasonal calendars to be made to begin at a significant period of the year (rather than, for example, on 1st January). Seasonal calendars should include a row for each of the following: I the months; I the local name for seasons and their meaning in terms of activities and production; I climatic features (mainly rainfall patterns); Figure 11 provides an example of a simplified seasonal calendar restricted to 12 months for ease of illustration."
