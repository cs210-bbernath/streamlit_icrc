"determine the rows. Figure 13 shows an example of stakeholder analysis matrix relating to a general food distribution (GFD). The above simplified matrix does not include such stakeholders as the humanitarian agency involved in the GFD, donors, and third parties that support the war effort. Stakeholders must be analysed in this example according to their relevance to the GFD; necessary negotiation must be undertaken in order to ensure the smooth delivery of the planned food assistance, i.e., its acceptance by all stakeholders. Here again, participatory dialogue is the only possible approach. # Figure 13 Stakeholder analysis matrixexample of a GFD # Why-why tree The why-why tree allows for a participatory debate on the underlying causes of a specific problem. It also facilitates the prioritization of such causes. It clearly illustrates the relationship between the cause and effect. By going to the roots of an issue, this tool makes it possible to better define objectives and to choose appropriate intervention strategies."
