The screening and treatment of contagious patients are sufficient to reduce transmission markedly. If the pathogenic agent gains the upper hand, the subject will present biological and clinical manifestations. The biological form of the disease does not necessarily give rise to the clinical form. In regions characterized by endemic malaria, for example,"
