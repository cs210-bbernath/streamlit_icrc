"local therapeutic practice. In every situation, the pros and cons of the two approaches must be weighed. Conventional treatment proves more effective than single-dose treatment in diseases such as bacterial meningitis, 21 schistosomiasis, and amebiasis. The opposite is true for tuberculosis, owing to the difference in the cost/benefit ratio between the short and long treatments. The use of placebos in emergency situations is controversial. Some believe that in the midst of all the urgent problems demanding concrete solutions, health-care workers should not ''waste time'' on insoluble problems. Others feel that the care provider should make some response to the patient's request, if necessary with a token therapeutic gesture. There are no precise rules in this domain. Every health worker must develop his or her own philosophy in the field, in the context of the situation. The case is different with measures designed to make the patient more comfortable. A patient's suffering must be alleviated, even if lack of means precludes a satisfactory therapeutic response."
