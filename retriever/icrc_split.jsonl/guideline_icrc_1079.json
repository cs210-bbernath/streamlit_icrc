"MUAC-for-height corroborates clinical classifi cation of marasmus better than weightfor-height. This observation is confi rmed by a study led by Van Loon, which concludes that MUACfor-age followed by MUAC-for-height are more appropriate than weight-for-height in defi ning marasmus (Van Loon, 1987). The nomenclature of the categories defi ned by classifi cation (the positioning of cut-off points) is strictly conventional and results must also be analysed and commented in order to avoid sometimes serious misunderstandings. For example, the 70% weight-for-height cut-off point (or -3 Z-scores) is more relevant as a criterion for admission into therapeutic feeding centres than as a threshold for the analysis of the overall nutritional status in a public health perspective, because it is both severe and specifi c. However, the current tendency is to consider only individuals that fall below this threshold when qualifying the severity of the nutritional situation in the overall population. From a public health angle, cut-off points must be selected in order to appraise the situation more sensitively,"
