"dwellings. -Factors favoring transmission: . the population's way of life -specifically, the population's behavior with respect to the vector. . the season. During the rainy season, transmission is much greater due to the increased number of pools of stagnant water in which the vector can multiply. . environmental characteristics such as average temperature, vegetation, the presence of surface water at times other than the rainy season (irrigation water, for example). The appropriate ''parasite plus vector'' combination is a key factor leading to the transmission of malarial infection within the population. # Susceptibility of the Population The susceptibility of the population depends on several factors: -the type of transmission In areas where transmission is stable throughout the year (holoendemic and hyperendemic regions), the immunity that results is also stable, and although the number of people presenting parasitemia may be high, the number of people actually sick is relatively low. In contrast, in regions of unstable or low transmission, immunity fluctuates,"
