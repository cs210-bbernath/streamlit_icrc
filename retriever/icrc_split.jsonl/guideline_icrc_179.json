"for this purpose, they are all generally referred to as ''chlorine.'' Two points are important here: Only free chlorine has a disinfectant action. Chlorine links with organic particles and is neutralized by the combination. Chlorine must therefore be added until all the organic particles in the water have been oxidized; 33 only then is free chlorine released in the water, allowing disinfection to begin. The effective dose of free chlorine is 0.5 mg/l, acting over a period of half an hour. There are numerous ways of measuring free chlorine in the water, colorimetric methods being the easiest and least expensive to use. Chemical treatment may be implemented in different ways according to circumstances; it may consist in simply immersing a pot containing a product that releases chlorine, or it may involve specialized equipment. Technological input consists of chemical products (basically chlorine and aluminum salts) and the equipment necessary to monitor the level of free chlorine in the water. # Boiling This method of treatment is seldom used in emergencies,"
