"easily done. # Measurement standardization or normalization It is best to practice before each measurement session or assessment in order to ensure that measurements are properly made, reproducible, and are similar. A dozen volunteers should be selected and measurements should be made by fi eld workers, under the supervision of an experienced operator. The latter records results and the mistakes that he or she observes; the operator then measures each subject him or herself, and records results as the reference value. Results obtained by the other participants are then discussed in detail, and workers repeat their measurements while the operator comments and corrects mistakes as they arise. Ultimately, each participating worker should produce at least fi ve successive results within 1 mm or 100 g of the reference value in the case of MUAC or weight; in the case of height, accuracy must be of the order of \u00b1 0.5 cm . A more complex normalization method is described in a WHO manual (WHO, 1983)."
