"not be described here; this section will focus instead on the criteria for choosing a particular type of pump in a given situation. To avoid long lists, 22 decisionmakers should focus on two main criteria and a few secondary ones. The first criterion is the operating mechanism of the pump, which may be one of two types: -the water is drawn up from above towards the outlet. -the water is pushed up from below, to the pump outlet. In the first case, the operating cylinder is above the well; in the second, it is in the water. Although the first solution would appear to be simpler, it is limited by the laws of physics, since if the water level is more than eight meters down, the pump can no longer operate. 23 The static level of the water table, then, will influence the choice of pump. The second criterion concerns the method of operating the pump: -manually (hand pump) -by an external energy source, such as wind, electricity, or sun."
