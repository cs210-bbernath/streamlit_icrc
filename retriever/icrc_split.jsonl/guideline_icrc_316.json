"four percent of all TB cases. By the year 2000, coinfection will dramatically increase to nearly one in seven of all TB cases.''

The mortality rate for meningococcal meningitis depends on the time that elapses between the onset of the disease and the initiation of medical care, and on the quality of that care. Untreated, the disease has a mortality rate of 50%; with treatment, the rate is still 10%. # Control Programs # Reducing Transmission The only possible preventive measure available for reducing the risk of transmitting the disease consists in limiting overcrowding. # Reinforcing Immunity Reinforcing immunity by means of immunization is a realistic measure, but two aspects warrant comment: -Serogroups A, B, and C can cause epidemics, but no vaccine is available for serogroup B."
