"than arbitrary recommendations however, it is best to understand the water supply situation from the outset, and allow for the necessary corrective measures accordingly. Where water is scarce, rainwater recycling systems may be considered. For water distribution, it is best to resort to pipes equipped with automatic taps (i.e. spring-off type) in key locations such as kitchens, treatment units, intensive care units, and ablution and laundry units. Alternatively, jerrycans and cooking cauldrons can be used, avoiding contamination in the process. One staff member must be specially assigned to water supply and management. In a TFC, drinking water (fi ltered, protected, covered, and treated with 0.5 mg of chlorine per litre) is used for the preparation of food, drinking, the preparation of rehydration solutions, medical care, and personal hygiene. The water used for cleaning the centre, kitchen utensils, and clothing should be chlorinated at 0.2%. The necessary quantity of water is determined by the number of patients: usual recommendations are 30 to 50 litres per patient per day."
