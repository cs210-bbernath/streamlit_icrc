"5 and 7 months, and is less brutal than the cardiac form. Infants produce hoarse and aphonic cries owing to paralysis of the laryngeal nerve. They cannot assimilate food, regurgitate or vomit it; they become anorexic and suffer from diarrhoea. They lose weight and become cachectic as the disorder advances.
