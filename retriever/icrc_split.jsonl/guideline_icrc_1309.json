"general risks prevailing, and its available space must permit extensions if necessary. A centre's layout is determined by the anticipated number of patients, and by access. The number of patients that can be admitted varies according to the magnitude of the problem and the number of TFC that can be opened in a given region. Centres have been known to accommodate between 100 and 1,400 patients. Smaller centres are easier to manage and their atmosphere is usually more relaxed and personal. Still, larger centres may be necessary in disasters, and are just as effi cient as smaller structures, provided that they are adequately staffed. The number of patients determines the TFC layout and the magnitude of its facilities. 9 Access to the TFC is much infl uenced by its location. If the target population is close by and access is easy, there is no need for annexes for the permanent accommodation of patients and their carers (other than during initial treatment, when 24-hour attention is necessary)"
