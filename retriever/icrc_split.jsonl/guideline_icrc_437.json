"useful concept in analysis, since it is the ratio between the rates of a variable measured in two populations, in one of which the variable presents a risk. For example, in area A, the incidence of diarrheal diseases in children under the age of five is 12%, while it is 4% in area B. The relative risk is the relation between the two rates; in this case, population A has three times the probability of diarrheal diseases as population B. If the relative risk is close to 1, there is essentially no difference between the two populations. The measure of relative risk applies in particular to cohorts. # Odds Ratio The odds ratio is based on the same principle. It is the ratio between the probability that a subject has been exposed to a risk factor and the probability that a control has been exposed to it. This test is used for controlled, unpaired studies, and is applied when a variable is measured for an entire population."
