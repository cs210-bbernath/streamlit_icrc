"floods. I Coping strategies. People buy building materials, salvage materials from their wrecked houses and obtain materials from relatives or kinships. Through a proportional piling exercise (see Section 7.1.3), you estimate that these strategies cover about 65 per cent of needs. (A) I Assistance. The municipality gives some building materials. This covers 10 per cent of needs. (B) I By combining their own coping strategies with assistance from the municipality, the people are able to cover approximately 65+10 = 75 per cent of their needs for building materials. Explain how percentages were calculated. # Notes For each affected population, list the needs that were identified in Step 2. Indicate whether existing coping strategies and current assistance are sufficient to cover needs (yes or no). I There is a \"gap\" in needs coverage of 100-75 = 25 per cent of needs (100-A-B). This might be covered by the Red Cross Red Crescent. # Assessment report For each assessment, compile a report structured according to the headings agreed within your delegation."
