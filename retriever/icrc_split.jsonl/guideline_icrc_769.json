Usually a 250 mg dose four times a day, administered orally for a week, brings vitamin C reserves back to the highest possible level. The risk of mortality is averted as of the fi rst dose; recovery is usually fast and complete. Except in the case of signifi cant vomiting, there is no need for the intravenous administration of vitamin C, especially because this form of administration results in tremendous vitamin C losses through urinary excretion, and is thus less effective than oral administration.
