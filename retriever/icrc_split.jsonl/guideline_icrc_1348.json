"and, less commonly, functional disorder caused by specifi c defi ciencies. Initial treatment aims at treating and preventing the direct causes of mortality in time. Practically, the following tasks are involved (ranked according to their priority). Initial treatment should not exceed a fortnight; if the above steps are not resolved within that period, then the patient is failing to respond, and death is likely to ensue. For greater clarity, each task is discussed separately, in spite of the frequent interrelation of problems that calls for a combined response. In famines however, severe malnutrition is sometimes strictly primary (and practically without complication), thus reducing the intensity of initial treatment. # Hypoglycaemia and hypothermia Hypoglycaemia and hypothermia often combine, and the fi rst precipitates the second. Both are major causes of mortality during the fi rst days following admission. # Hypoglycaemia Hypoglycaemia is caused by an interval of more than 4 to 6 hours between meals after the inception of initial treatment, and by severe systemic infection."
