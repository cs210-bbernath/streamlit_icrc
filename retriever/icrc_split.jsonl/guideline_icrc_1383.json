"The same calculation applies to adults, for example a severely malnourished man only weighing 42 kg. Still leaving correction factors aside, his maintenance requirements for 42 kg is approximately 1,600 kcal (6,700 kJ) and 31.5 g of protein, whereas the catch-up of 20 g/kg/day requires 4,200 kcal (17,560 kJ) and 131 g of protein. His total daily intake must then amount to 5,800 kcal (24,240 kJ) and 162.5 g of protein, for a P/E ratio of 11.2%. These two examples show the extent of nutritional catch-up requirements in adolescents and adults. In overt crisis, the individual sojourn in a TFC should be kept as short as possible in order to restrict the waiting time of potential patients to a minimum. Nutritional rehabilitation must therefore be fast, and the objective should be a catch-up of 20 g/kg/day. This goal can be unrealistic because of biological discrepancies and differences in health status, behaviour, and circumstances; an average catch-up rate of 15 g/kg/day is thus satisfactory."
