"the condition sought (e.g. 15%) the lower or higher limit (e.g. 10%) 4. Press F4 to obtain the result (e.g. 189). # Tools for the Statistical Analysis of Sample Data # Basic Principles As explained above, for a given population the means obtained from several samples of the same size will produce an average which will deviate more or less from the true mean, as calculated from the entire population. These sample means are distributed around the true mean so that 95% of them are within + 1.96 times the standard error (SE). This principle is the basis for the following line of reasoning. To compare a given variable in two populations, a sample must be taken in each population and compared with each other, to see whether they are similar or different. However, since these values were obtained from samples, they present a certain risk of error. In fact, a situation may arise where the true values for the two populations are similar,"
