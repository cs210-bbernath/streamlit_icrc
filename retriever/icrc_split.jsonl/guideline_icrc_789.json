"usually suffi ces to remedy wet, infantile and shoshin beriberi, and to arrest the neuropathy associated with dry beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. In some cases, the consumption of legumes up to 120 g per day prevents and treats beriberi (Davidson et al., 1979). This comment does not imply that this treatment should be applied alone in the presence of alternatives, but rather that the absence of chemical thiamine should not discourage action. Furthermore, if beriberi is suspected in a hospital or dispensary, then perfusions containing sugars (e.g. dextrose) must be combined with thiamine supplementation of at least 10 mg/day. Sweetened intravenous solutions are likely to cause an increase of the energy metabolism and, thus, raise thiamine requirements. Sweetened perfusions administered without thiamine are therefore likely to precipitate beriberi in cases of marginal defi ciency, not to mention the disastrous consequences on declared but undetected cases. Beriberi usually accompanies severe malnutrition, and even often causes it. But it also frequently combines with other specifi c defi ciencies,"
