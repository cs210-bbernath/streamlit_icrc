The microbiological quality of drinking water is measured by the presence of Escherichia coli. 7 However, an absence of E. coli is not always an easily attainable goal in emergency situations; a more realistic target is the WHO-recommended standard for rural areas, which accepts the presence of a few coliforms. The WHO policy, designed essentially for rural areas under normal conditions, has been adopted by UNICEF for emergency situations: The presence of faecal coliforms indicates that the water has been contaminated by faeces of humans or other warm-blooded animals. Concentrations are usually expressed per 100 ml of water. As a rough guide: . 0-10 faecal coliforms/100 ml = reasonable quality . 10-100 faecal coliforms/100 ml = polluted # Chemical Quality The presence of toxic substances (arsenic, mercury, lead, nitrates, etc.) or abnormally high levels of trace elements (such as fluoride)"
