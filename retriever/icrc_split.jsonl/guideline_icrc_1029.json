"around \"p\": p \u00b1 b%. # Simple random sampling Any value obtained experimentally by sampling is of course liable to differ from the real value, as obtained by comprehensive investigation. It is best, therefore, to defi ne the acceptable risk that experimental values are really different from real values, and an acceptable confi dence interval within which the real value is likely to be found, according to the sampling error -without it being possible to know where exactly in that interval it is located. Usually, the sampling error is set at 5%; in other words, it is accepted that there are 5 chances out of 100 that the real value is not included in the confi dence interval at all. The confi dence interval itself is determined by the intended accuracy: a 5% accuracy around the experimental result is usually considered as acceptable, but this depends on circumstances. For example, in comparing results with those obtained six months before, confi dence intervals must not overlap,"
