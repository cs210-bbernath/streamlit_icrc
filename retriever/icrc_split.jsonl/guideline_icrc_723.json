"battle of Solferino took place, in the course of which Henry Dunant was horrified to see wounded men abandoned to their fate. After returning to Geneva, in 1862 he published the book Un Souvenir de Solferino (A Memory of Solferino), which had a profound impact in Europe. In February, 1863, the ''International Committee for Relief to Wounded Soldiers'' was created. In October of the same year, an international conference was organized in Geneva with representatives from 16 States. It adopted the distinctive sign of the red cross on a white background. In 1864, the Swiss Federal Council convoked another international conference at which the plenipotentiaries of the States drew up the Geneva Convention of 22 August 1864 for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field. In 1880, the International Committee for Relief to Wounded Soldiers changed its name to ''International Committee of the Red Cross."
