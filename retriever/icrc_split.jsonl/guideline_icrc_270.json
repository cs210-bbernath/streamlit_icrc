From this perspective, coordinating effective clinical screening with quickly accessible medical treatment is essential. There are more extended interventions. For example, immunization against measles, which prevents that disease, also helps prevent the concomitant diarrheal attacks. This impact on the global control of diarrheal diseases, however, is secondary. # Malaria Dealing with malaria is complicated enough in ordinary situations; controlling it during crises depends on a combination of activities. In the framework of this course, a detailed analysis of highly specialized activities (for example, calculating vector capacity or using in vitro tests to determine the parasite's sensitivity to drugs),"
