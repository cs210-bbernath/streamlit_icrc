"General aspects during assessment I. Assessment of assessment methods 3.3 Data collection 9 demographic 9 epidemiological 9 ecological and environmental 9 economic 9 social 9 political By virtue of the concept of optimal ignorance, only essential indicators should be selected; it is preferable to add indicators as assessment proceeds and as they are required, rather than wasting time collecting useless information. # DATA COLLECTION # Targeting preliminary appraisal Data collection is always targeted. The key to the target is provided by the aggressive phenomena, recognized vulnerabilities and, in the case of preliminary or intermediary assessment, existing harm that corresponds to the warning signals. Preliminary appraisal must defi ne assessment areas and groups that may share the same needs because they face the same problems. Targeting regions and population groups for assessment is derived fi rstly from the warning signals, and later broadens in order to include all regions and groups that face the same risk, or will do so."
