"is difficult to define the problem of malaria quantitatively. Attempts may, however, be made to quantify: -The prevalence of the parasitemia Prevalence of the parasitemia can be measured directly from a sampling of the population. This measurement will indicate what percentage of the population presents Plasmodium in the blood. 50 The measurement of the prevalence of gametocytes in the blood indicates the percentage of infectious people. 51 -The vector's capacity to transmit malaria The vector's capacity to transmit malaria depends on various factors, including the density of the vector in the human environment, the number of times it bites humans per day, its survival rate, and the period of incubation inside the vector. Estimating these factors is the job of an entomologist, who should be called in for the purpose. -The degree of transmission The degree of transmission can be measured by means of the splenic index in children from two to nine years old. Together with the plasmodic index (subjects carrying Plasmodium), it indicates the type of endemic involved."
