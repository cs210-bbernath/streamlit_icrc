"limits itself to specifi c fi elds of action, such as food aid and curative healthcare. The approach is global and concentrates on the daily life of society, according to cultural standards. # Cost of the action The goods and services are provided free of charge, because recipients are assumed to be completely destitute at the time of implementation. Financial contribution is the rule, mainly for recipients to contribute to decisionmaking and ensure ownership (if not, they do not participate). # Interaction with offi cials Initiative, even interference, is tolerated because substitution is obligatory, and because the end is thought to justify the means (rightly or wrongly). Development operations are doomed to failure without the direct participation of local authorities and society. Their support is actively sought. # Interaction with local associations Usually neglected, again because of the emergency, and because relief workers usually lack the skills and inclination to cooperate with local associations. The rule, because development must be anchored in local structures for success."
