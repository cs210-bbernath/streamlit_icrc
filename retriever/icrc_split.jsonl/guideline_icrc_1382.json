"should be 250 kcal (1,050 kJ)/kg/day. With respect to protein, a corresponding P/E ration of 10 to 12% should be an adequate intake. In adolescents, energy requirements for catch-up much exceed maintenance requirements, whereas protein catch-up requirements convert into a P/E ratio of at least 11.5%. Take the example of a severely malnourished 14-year old girl weighing only 30 kg at the beginning of rehabilitation. Leaving aside the correction for her reduced basal metabolism because of malnutrition, her maintenance requirements for 30 kg is roughly 1,360 kcal (5,680 kJ) and 28.5 g of protein, that is, a P/E ratio of 8.4%. In order to achieve a catch-up of 20 g/kg/day (i.e. 20 \u00d7 30 = 600 g), she requires another 3,000 kcal (12,540 kJ) and 96 g of protein. Her total daily requirement is then 4,360 kcal (18,220 kJ) and 124.5 g of protein, for a P/E ratio of 11.4%. The same calculation applies to adults, for example a severely malnourished man only weighing 42 kg."
