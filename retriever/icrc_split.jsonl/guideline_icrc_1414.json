This can be the case provided that they are not implemented in isolation, and that they contribute to the implementation of all the steps required to respond to the need for assistance. SFPs can then easily be changed to address persisting moderate malnutrition effectively, and act as safety nets -meaning that they are no longer consigned to simple food distributions. # INTERVENTION CRITERIA Usually in a nutritional crisis, SFPs should be curative; as a result, the criterion triggering their implementation is moderate malnutrition.
