"during infancy, artifi cial feeding substantially increases children's risk of illness and death.\" (WHO, 1998). Furthermore, it remains unclear to what extent breastfeeding infl uences HIV development in mothers. The observation that the combination of a good nutritional status and appropriate healthcare substantially limit the progress of the illness is, in a sense, alarming (McAskill, 2000). It indicates that breastfeeding and the resulting drainage of maternal nutritional resources in favour of the child could increase the mother's vulnerability -this would tend to argue in favour of substituting maternal milk with artifi cial alternatives if feasible. This poses a serious problem for humanitarian action, which often deals with groups that face increased health problems in all fi elds, and cannot be treated individually (unless they are gathered in camps). Ultimately, the theoretical answer to mother-to-child HIV transmission through breastfeeding is to supply HIV-positive mothers with appropriate maternal milk substitutes, and the means to prepare them in line with the hygiene standards discussed earlier. The remaining question is then one of feasibility,"
