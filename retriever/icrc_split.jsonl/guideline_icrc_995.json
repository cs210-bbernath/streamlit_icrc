"data review This is important, both in preliminary appraisal and thorough investigation. Much data is already available in books, reports and collective memory, and there is therefore no need to waste time seeking it in the fi eld. This review must be performed before and during assessment (possibly afterwards also, in order to document specifi c points more thoroughly). Prior to assessment, it serves the following purposes. 9 To acquire a basic or minimum understanding of the country and region chosen for assessment. This approach avoids excessive confusion at the onset, eases contact and builds bridges with the local population, and this is usually appreciated. This is natural courtesy, and incidentally saves time. 9 To obtain relevant information before conducting the assessment itself. Practically the entire world has been studied; most regions that require humanitarian attention have suffered crises before. As a result, it is usually possible to obtain useful information, whatever the location may be."
