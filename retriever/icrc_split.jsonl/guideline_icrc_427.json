"- Validity - Reliability Qualities more specific to emergencies: - Applicability -speed -simplicity -reproducibility - Acceptability: -by the population -by the authorities # Uniformity All information sources must respect the same criteria for defining the indicators and the tests used. # Improving the Reliability of Information Sources # Training Adequate training of the personnel commissioned to collect data and convey them to analysis centers is essential if quality information is to be obtained. # Availability of Simple, Effective Means The danger of false, incomplete data increases with the complexity of the questionnaires that health-care personnel must fill out. Thus, it is preferable to make a correct analysis based on simple facts rather than to base the analysis on complex but false information. The use of computer programs (EPIINFO) to construct questionnaires is a quick and effective solution -provided you know how to run a computer program! # Personnel Motivation Training helps motivate the staff, since it clarifies the purpose of collecting the data."
