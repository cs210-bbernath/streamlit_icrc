"During nutritional rehabilitation, the amount of food should cover maintenance and nutritional catch-up requirements. This permits patients to gain weight quickly, and to promote the metabolic shift towards anabolism, that is, tissue synthesis. This change occurs through a modifi ed balance and hormone control, and is not quickly reversible towards catabolism, which should nevertheless occur when energy requirements for maintenance exceed available nutrients. This is the case for example when the intervals between meals are excessive and daily energy intakes cover neither the catch-up underway (which is a priority in the anabolic phase), nor maintenance requirements, nor those associated with physical activity and/or thermo-genesis. As a result, a regular and adequate diet must be provided in order to avoid energy requirements not being met in time through a metabolic reversal towards catabolism. This usually entails hypoglycaemia, followed by hypothermia and death, especially in infants. This aspect is all the more important in view of the fact that nutritional catch-up is calorie and energyintensive, requiring 5 kcal (21 kJ) and 0."
