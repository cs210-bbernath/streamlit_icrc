"indicators of wasting, which ultimately causes marasmus, and death. The most appropriate indicators of wasting are MUAC, MUAC-for-height, and weight-for-height. MUAC is a better warning of mortality than weight-for-height. The use of MUAC alone is adequate to select individuals, but the measurement of the nutritional status of an overall population is best done with MUAC-for-height. Many sources consider weight-for-height to be the best indicator (or reference indicator) for wasting; however, this is not backed by scientifi c evidence. To distinguish between anthropometric indicators according to their refl ection of wasting, they must be compared to another indicator that can serve as reference. Such an indicator may be obtained by clinical observation of specifi c signs, or the accurate measurement of lean mass and adipose tissue -this can usually not be done in the fi eld. On the basis of clinical observation, the author of this Manual has noticed repeatedly that MUAC-for-height corroborates clinical classifi cation of marasmus better than weightfor-height."
