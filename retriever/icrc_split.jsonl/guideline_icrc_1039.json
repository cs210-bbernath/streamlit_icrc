"say 5 i = a given cluster within the overall sample (numbered 1 to k) p i = the actual prevalence rate in cluster i n = the actual sample size = 220 \u03a3 = the sum of all values If the results obtained from the 5 clusters in the sample are 28.5%, 24.2%, 33.1%, 27.2% and 30.9%, the sum of (p i -p) 2 is calculated as follows: This then permits the calculation of accuracy itself: accuracy = \u00b1 1.96 \u00d7 1/2 = \u00b1 3.3% And the fi nal result is then 30.1 \u00b1 3.3%. # General aspects of assessment methods 3.4 Selecting subjects # Complete enumeration In some cases, it may be easier and faster to avoid sampling altogether, and observe all subjects within the overall population. This is the case, for example, in anthropometry, especially in using mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) or MUAC-for-height, which are faster to measure than weight and height."
