"and vitamin A defi ciency reinforce one another. Experimentation involving animals has demonstrated that vitamin A defi ciency, more than any other, is associated early with infectious developments, particularly those affecting epithelial tissue. Such infections develop before the appearance of signs of xerophthalmia. Although vitamin A supplementation does not appear to alter moderate diarrhoea, it does infl uence mortality associated with diarrhoeal disorder by reducing the incidence of severe diarrhoea. The effect is proportional to the daily number of stools. A major study conducted in a hospital environment showed that the prevalence of respiratory infection 2. Nutritional disorder 2.5 Specifi c defi ciency increased with the severity of xerophthalmia. However, vitamin A supplementation does not appear to infl uence acute inferior respiratory infection; it is possible that the association between inferior respiratory infection and vitamin A defi ciency only appears in the case of severe defi ciency. With respect to measles, the vitamin A status infl uences morbidity directly,"
