"need to be taken. For example, a relatively simple questionnaire permits a rapid assessment of the main causes of death among the children of a displaced population. The procedure to follow can be summarized as follows: -Draw up a list of syndromes which appear to be the main causes of death. In the case of communicable diseases, these would consist primarily of measles, diarrheal diseases, malaria, and meningitis. -Describe the symptoms used to identify the communicable diseases in question; the medical personnel and the individuals questioned may have markedly different interpretations of the same clinical manifestation. A minimal knowledge of local terminology is essential. 13 -Verify the information. This is difficult in the case of mortality, 14 since the data received cannot be confirmed except by information from other sources -for example, the causes of death for hospitalized children. 14 In the case of morbidity, confirmation by biological tests promotes greater exactitude. 15 Keep in mind that the confirming source may also be inexact."
