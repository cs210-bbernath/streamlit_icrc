"utilization of distributed food for other ends than those initially intended. It is worth noting here that, in terms of calories, minimal survival rations are only approximately 15% lower than the planning rations discussed in NUTRITION MANUAL Chapter XII -General food distribution 3. GFD implementation 3.2 Setting rations this Manual, and only 10% lower than those recommended by the WFP and the WHO. Circumstances must therefore be very restrictive indeed to prevent logistical adjustments aimed at increasing rations by 10 to 15%, and improving their adequacy accordingly. In such extreme circumstances, the foodstuffs chosen for inclusion must have the highest possible energy content (i.e. cereals, legumes, oil, biscuits, and CSB), and canned foods should be avoided. Spices and seasonings and, possibly, coffee or tea, should nevertheless be included, and fresh products should also be supplied if they are locally available. In principle, biscuits and CSB should fully complement basic rations in terms of micro-nutrients, failing which powders or tablets must be supplied."
