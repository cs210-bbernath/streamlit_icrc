"one of three categories of nutritional status: acceptable nutritional status, moderate malnutrition, and severe malnutrition. The method presents the advantage of removing the need for accurate height measurement, which saves time, human resources (two persons are no longer required), and calculations. This method is called QUAC Stick (for Quaker Arm Circumference -a team of Quakers initially developed the method during the Biafran war). 27 Conventional cut-off points and classifi cation 9 > 85% or > -2 Z-scores: 28 satisfactory nutritional status 9 85 to 75% or -2 Z-scores to -3 Z-scores: moderate malnutrition 9 < 75% or < -3 Z-scores: severe malnutrition. # MUAC Mid-upper arm circumference changes little in children aged 1 to 5 years. As a result, it may not need to be combined with another measurement in order to be compared to reference values. Advantages: a good indicator of wasting; it requires a single, simple measurement and is thus fast; age need not be specifi ed. Drawbacks: the method is less accurate than the QUAC Stick method."
