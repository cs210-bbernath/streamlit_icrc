"for humanitarian action. After all, a 2,100 kcal (8,780 kJ) ration is only 13.5% lower than a 2,400 kcal (10,030 kJ) ration. This is not much in view of context-specifi c and biological variations, which infl uence the nutritional need and its coverage. As any experienced fi eld worker knows, this small difference lies within the variation and adjustment margin of logistical systems. The author prefers a planning ration that amounts to modern recommended energy intakes for moderately active populations. The application of intakes recommended by Latham for adults in developing countries (Latham, 1997) to the WHO 2 ration provided in Table 12.2 above results in a ration of 2,243 kcal (9,375 kJ) that can be rounded up to 2,250 kcal (9,400 kJ). This ration is neither restrictive nor exaggerated and, combined with a \u00b150 kcal (\u00b1210 kJ) tolerance margin, makes ethical and nutritional sense. # GFD implementation 3.2 Setting rations Table 12.5 below provides examples of rations that total approximately 2,250 kcal (9,400 kJ)."
