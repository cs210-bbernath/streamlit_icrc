"is thus a very serious illness, and preventive and curative measures must be taken as soon as dietary vitamin C defi ciency is suspected. The clinical signs of scurvy mainly result from an inhibited collagen synthesis, which accounts for the maintenance of the cell structure of mesenchyme tissue such as bone, cartilage, dentine and connective tissue. The traditional clinical signs combine with other, behavioural, symptoms: emotional instability, apathy, and depression. Moreover, vitamin C defi ciency precipitates anaemia owing to loss of blood, and an impaired performance of the vitamin C function in the absorption and utilization of iron and the folic acid metabolism. An infantile form of scurvy is called Moeller-Barlow disease; it particularly attacks the bone tissue of the thorax and the cartilage of the bone extremities (epiphyses). Infantile scurvy affects infants fed artifi cially on non-vitamin C enriched formulas, which, once heated, lose what little vitamin C is contained in the powder. Forerunner signs include irritability, a pallid complexion, and loss of appetite."
