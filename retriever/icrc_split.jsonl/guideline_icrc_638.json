"the provision is based on the principle that States are primarily responsible for organizing relief. Relief societies such as the Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations are called upon to play an auxiliary role by assisting the authorities in their task.'' 21 External assistance enters the picture if the authorities are unable to meet their obligations: ''Such external aid is complementary; it is only provided when the responsible authorities can no longer meet the basic necessities of the civilian population whose survival is in jeopardy.'' 22 It is important that health-care personnel understand this division of responsibility well. Thus, the decision to set up a surgical hospital to care for war-wounded should be based not merely on the presence of war-wounded, but on an analysis of the correlation between local surgical facilities and the care required by the wounded. Only if the local hospitals are unable to provide the necessary care can external intervention be contemplated."
