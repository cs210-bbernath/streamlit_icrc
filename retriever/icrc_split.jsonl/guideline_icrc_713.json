"achieve it, a model for interagency relations may be proposed. Such a model should be based not on a rigid coordination, but rather on a flexible system of mutual conference. # A Code of Conduct Based on ''Good Relations'' between Agencies A practical code of conduct will help to harmonize the interaction of humanitarian interventions in a given situation. # Problems and Priorities: The Decision to Intervene When events call for a humanitarian intervention, the humanitarian agencies will assess the problems and priorities. Their decision to intervene will depend on the nature of the problems identified and the nature of their mandate. When the one coincides with the other, the agencies will consult together to find out what each plans to do, while respecting one another's independence and neutrality. This approach does not entail any formal undertaking between the agencies, but is a way to consolidate support for the actual principle of intervening and to determine the forms that intervention could take."
