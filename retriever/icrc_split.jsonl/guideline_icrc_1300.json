"FEEDING IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION Within the framework of humanitarian action in crisis, therapeutic feeding is part of survival relief 3 efforts and represents the last safety net before death (see Figure 13.1 below). # Figure 13.1 Therapeutic feeding within humanitarian action Therapeutic feeding can also be implemented when malnutrition reaches epidemic proportions, caused by health problems associated with water and environmental hygiene, habitat and/or the inability of existing health services to address signifi cant endemic or seasonal malnutrition effectively. # THE OBJECTIVE OF THERAPEUTIC FEEDING The objective of therapeutic feeding is quite simple: avoiding the death of severely malnourished individuals and restoring their nutritional status up to satisfactory levels. A satisfactory level permits survival in a natural environment, provided that living conditions are adequate; the latter are usually the object of other types of humanitarian attention. # OPERATIONAL PRIORITY Therapeutic feeding is a fl agship of humanitarian action that attracts prime-time media attention and shocks the public, politicians and donors alike. 3 See Chapter IX."
