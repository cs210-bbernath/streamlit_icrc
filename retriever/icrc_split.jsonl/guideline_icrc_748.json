"It is always difficult, presumptuous, and arrogant to judge the quality of the work supplied by local sources. Every judgment is based on norms. Initially, the terms of reference must be defined: international norms, customary local norms. The latter should take priority -as long as they meet a certain criterion of effectiveness, since it would be ethically questionable to base an intervention on erroneous local norms. For example, an immunization program against cholera should not be introduced even if the laws in force recommend it. In certain situations, the constraints involved are so complex that it is difficult to follow any norms. From a pragmatic point of view, the choice is sometimes between abstention or an external intervention which, although possibly outside the acknowledged norms, nevertheless brings a certain relief to the victims. In this case, the terms of reference should not be norms, but rather what the alternatives would be."
