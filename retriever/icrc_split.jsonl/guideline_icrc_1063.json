"individuals within the reference population. However, there is by defi nition no value below the third centile: an index lower than that falls in the general category of malnutrition, and it remains unclear whether it is a severe or moderate case. # Assessment tools 4.4 Nutritional anthropometry In the above example, an 8 kg weight for an 80 cm height is lower than the third centile of the reference population, meaning that the boy is malnourished, but without indication as to whether he is severely or moderately so. # Standard deviation from the median Standard deviation 26 is also called Z-score. Its use is spreading, because it is the best index to compare populations (and, thus, surveys) and individuals. Variables that are characteristic of a reference population usually follow a normal distribution of 2 standard deviations around the median, and this includes approximately 95% of the reference population. In biology and medical science, values lying outside this bracket are considered as abnormal or pathological."
