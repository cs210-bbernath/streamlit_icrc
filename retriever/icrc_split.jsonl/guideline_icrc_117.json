"Nutritional Emergencies in Large Populations defines the purpose of supplementary feeding as: ''to supplement deficiencies in energy and/or nutrients, especially protein, in the basic diet of those most vulnerable to malnutrition: children under 5, pregnant or lactating women, medical cases, old people, children selected by a screening method.'' 66 The first definition equates supplementary feeding with nutritional rehabilitation. It is true that in some cases the strategy used to deal with the problem of moderate malnutrition will be the distribution of supplementary rations in addition to the general ration. This approach, however, tends to obscure the fact that supplementary feeding programs are intended for all nutritionally vulnerable groups, 67 not merely the cases of moderate malnutrition. There may also be confusion with partial feeding, as it was described in connection with general food distribution. In that context, it was defined as a complement to local food resources, provided when the latter do not offer adequate coverage of normal nutritional needs. 64 Ron Ockwell, ed., Assisting in Emergencies (UNICEF, May 1986),"
