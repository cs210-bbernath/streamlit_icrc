"health services easier access to the health system In view of the intermittent nature of the services provided by an MHU, any other strategy for providing health services is to be preferred. # MHUs require highly trained human resources The implications of triage, the limited range of services available, continuous analysis of problems, use of the intrinsic flexibility of MHUs, and the need to ensure that the operation is consistent with the ICRC's objectives outside the area of health mean that staff working in MHUs must adhere to a strict and rational public health approach. # MHUs are a favoured strategy for vertical programmes A programme is described as vertical when the health personnel involved are brought in from another facility (usually one on a higher level in the health hierarchy) to dispense specific treatment. For example, a health centre may receive specialists in leishmaniasis or malaria, or a hospital may receive an ophthalmological surgeon. These vertical programmes exist alongside the existing network of health centres and hospitals."
