"harm caused by the combination of phenomena and vulnerability, and whether the performances of the feeding process are abnormally insuffi cient, or likely to become so. 2. In the presence of existing or anticipated harm, to defi ne whether it poses a problem and, if so, of what type; this amounts to determining the presence (or anticipated presence) of an abnormal imbalance between needs and means, and locating it within the different levels of the feeding process. 3. To defi ne the resulting needs for assistance, their respective priority, and the opportunities and constraints that may infl uence the delivery of the required assistance; this is achieved through retrospective analysis (present and future) of disorders and their causes. The subsequent planning consists in defi ning operational proposals based upon the necessary priorities; these proposals must combine the need for assistance, the opportunities, and the constraints in a realistic programme. These objectives fall within the framework of the preliminary appraisal process as illustrated in Figure 10.2 below."
