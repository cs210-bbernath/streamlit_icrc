The analytical study of the impact of interventions is useful for identifying deficiencies. The purpose is not to stigmatize those responsible, but to allow agencies to judge how far they can rely on each other in coordinating subsequent operations. Informal coordination combines program effectiveness with the flexibility necessary to insure that the various mandates of the different agencies are respected."
