These two basic principles -the integration of disaster prevention in a global development policy and the States' primary responsibility in both devising prevention programs and managing response -have challenged the role of international humanitarian agencies, which had a tendency to monopolize disaster interventions without concerning themselves with local response capacities or possibilities of prevention, the starting point for any development process.
