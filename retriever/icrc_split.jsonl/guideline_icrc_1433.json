"situation found only when SFPs are combined with effi cient GFDs, and provide safety nets or relays for therapeutic feeding. In view of all the possible problems related to an inadequate basic ration and a sub-optimal health status, the recommended recovery rate is approximately 5 g/kg/day. A lower recovery rate usually indicates that feeding at home is insuffi cient, but the health status also needs to be verifi ed. It must be noted that the 5 g/kg/day recommendation is valid only if the supplementary ration is properly enriched in vitamins and minerals according to the formula included in Annex 16. The health condition of patients under treatment should normally be monitored on a daily basis, and progress consigned on an individual data sheet; deaths and their cause should also be registered. # Attendance monitoring This monitoring is of utmost importance in ensuring appropriate benefi ciary feeding. When meals are eaten within the centre, it is done during each meal, in a register indicating bracelet number and benefi ciary name."
