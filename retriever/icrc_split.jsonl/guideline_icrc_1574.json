"P/E% = - Setting full rations usually involves the inclusion of other foodstuffs in order to supply micronutrients and improve their diversity and fl avour. Such foods normally only represent a small proportion of the energy intake, and do not affect the above principles in a signifi cant way (even if, for instance, part of the oil is replaced with sugar). In some circumstances, it may be necessary to replace staple foods with others; this must then be done within the limits set by: 9 eating habits; 9 food quality; 9 their requirements in terms of preparation, and the compatibility of the latter with the recipients' possibilities. From a nutritional perspective, all cereals are understood as being equivalent, so are legumes, and so are fats and oils. Oil may be partly replaced with sugar or oilseeds based on calorie equivalents, but Foodstuffs that supply macro-nutrients also contain signifi cant amounts of micro-nutrients, but not all such foodstuffs contain all micro-nutrients, or in suffi cient amounts."
