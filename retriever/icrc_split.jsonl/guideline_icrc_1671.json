"consumption in the world, this Manual prefers to set the upper limit for its consumption, which is identical to that for sugar. Alcohol should not account for more than 10% (ideally less, even not at all) of the average required overall energy intake of nutritionally healthy adults. With respect to an overall energy requirement of 2,400 kcal (10,000 kJ), being that of a lightly active adult male weighing 60 kg, this upper limit amounts to 240 kcal; this amount converts daily into 3 dl of wine, 7 dl of light beer (5% alcohol/volume), or 0.8 dl of liquor (40% alcohol/volume). # Application The above principles provide a general framework for a dietetic approach to diets. Table 15.1 below illustrates their practical application, by suggesting family diets built upon the eating habits of different regions; it is adapted from Latham (Latham, 1997). # ANNEX 1 ENERGY COST OF SPECIFIC OCCUPATIONS: EXAMPLES The cost is expressed as a multiple of the basal metabolism (BM). Adapted from WHO (WHO, 1985)."
