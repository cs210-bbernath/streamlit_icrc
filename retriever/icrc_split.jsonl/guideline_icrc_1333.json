"small children. 9. At the beginning of initial treatment and until appetite resumes and the TFC environment grows familiar, the presence of mothers or carers is essential to children. Subsequently however, experience has shown that their presence is rather a disadvantage, except for infants and the sick. As a result, patients must learn to feed themselves as quickly as possible, or to accept the help of TFC assistants. # Healthcare Healthcare must be systematic, 11 and consist of medical examination and individual care. Medical examination is performed every time and as soon as patients present problems of a medical nature. It is performed daily for patients undergoing treatment (including rehydration), and at each weighing session during initial treatment and the fi rst week of rehabilitation. Individual care is delivered to subjects whose medical disorder requires treatment. Except for the type of care that requires qualifi ed medical staff, assistants in charge of supervising mealtimes must administer antibiotics and rehydration salts to patients undergoing treatment that are in their care."
