"layer of waste strengthens the fi lter through a clotting process (Cairncross & Feachem, 1993). Sand fi ltration requires no more than a simple barrel fi lled with alternating layers of sand and gravel. Oxfam material is commonly used in humanitarian operations; this equipment is highly effective, and consists of three reservoirs. The fi rst is a storage (and, thus, sedimentation) reservoir that contains the untreated water. The second is a fi lter, and the third is a purifi er. As indicated above, passive or active sedimentation must be performed before fi ltration according to water turbidity. Purifi cation describes a chemical or thermal treatment that kills germs. Chemical purifi cation with chlorine is the most common method; it must be performed by an expert, and this Manual therefore limits itself to only describing its principle. The different chemicals used for chlorine purifi cation are distinguished according to their specifi c active chlorine concentrations."
