"an assessment. It provides guidance on those elements that should be looked at in order to gain a better understanding of an emergency situation. The content of an assessment relates to how people are coping after a crisis or a shock. This can be determined by a comprehensive and integrated review of the context, the crisis or shock, the agencies involved, the problems faced by the populations directly or indirectly affected, and the response strategies they have put in place. It goes without saying that most of the information is obtained by talking to the communities concerned using a participatory approach. In Part 2, the ICRC covers the household economy approach, while the International Federation details the elements to look at 24 hours and 48-72 hours after a disaster. While Part 1 (process) tackles issues of common interest to both organizations, the information in Part 2 (content) is relative to the work of each organization."
