"a different distance from the mean. On the basis of this fact, the degree to which these values vary from the mean can be determined by calculations of various kinds, ranging from the simplest to the most complex. 18 The basic measures of variability are: . the mean deviation: the sum of the individual deviations (ignoring negative or positive signs) divided by the number of observations; . the variance: the sum of the squares of individual deviations divided by the number of observations; 19 . the standard deviation: the square root of the variance. 20 Calculating the standard deviation is pointless unless it will lead to practical applications. The mean and the standard deviation represented on a Gaussian curve produce the following result: . 68% of the individual values are situated within the limits constituted by the mean and +1 standard deviation. . 96% of the individual values are situated within the limits constituted by the mean and +2 standard deviations."
