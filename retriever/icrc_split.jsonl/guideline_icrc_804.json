"gastro-intestinal and digestive tract disorders thus appear fi rst. But they must still be recognized as such, in a timely fashion. In other words, a signifi cant reservoir of sub-clinical defi ciency cases (or clinical defi ciency that has not yet been identifi ed as such) may already exist. At this stage, the risk of mortality is already high, particularly because of high vulnerability to opportunistic infection. This may raise mortality, without the nutritional problems having been detected, be they the prevalence of severe malnutrition or unambiguous clinical signs of niacin defi ciency. Only the analysis of dietary intake and the response to the treatment of suspected cases of defi ciency enable the timely detection of the disorder. In any case, when the doubt concerns the entire population, immediate steps must be taken to improve the diet. # Treatment The most serious cases require bed rest; 50 mg niacin doses must be administered orally three times daily during fi fteen days or until the disappearance of clinical signs."
