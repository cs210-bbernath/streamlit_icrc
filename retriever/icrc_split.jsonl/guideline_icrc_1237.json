"humanitarian agencies should only engage in assistance operations if they have the means to do so. Targeting that is justifi ed by a lack of resources should therefore only be a passing problem arising from unexpected developments. The incessant and popular claim that humanitarian aid always lacks resources can seriously undermine the credibility of operating agencies; the latter must therefore not surrender to diffi culties and encourage such views. Politically-correct assistance can always rely on ample (even sometimes excessive) resources. Donors must therefore be persuaded of the minimum level of assistance required in the given circumstances. # Feasibility It may be diffi cult to single out specifi c households within a given community. The exercise entails two major challenges. The fi rst relates to the targeting itself, which may not be acceptable to the community and/or their leaders. Some cultures require that assistance be shared among all members of the community, and targeting specifi c households is pointless in this case. Such cultures usually rest upon strong social obligations,"
