"refugees in Thailand, Somalia, Sudan, and Malawi, where 50-95% of deaths were attributed to measles, diarrheal diseases, and acute respiratory infections. 1 Other important communicable diseases include meningitis (refugees from Sudan and Thailand), cholera (refugees from Somalia, Sudan, Malawi, etc.), and typhus (displaced populations in Ethiopia). Sometimes a refugee population contributes to an increased risk for a particular communicable disease in an environment which was previously free from it. This was the case, for example, when Sudanese refugees arrived in northern Uganda, in an area where trypanosomiasis had been under control. To define the kinds of intervention that can prevent such epidemics, it is essential to be familiar with the mechanisms that give these diseases a particular impact in emergency situations. # Factors Influencing the Impact of Communicable Diseases in Emergencies The epidemics that develop in disaster situations are essentially a function of the large concentrations of displaced people or refugees living together in camps where living conditions are particularly hazardous."
