In settings where the above factors are familiar and well understood, such adjustments may already be made during the planning phase. Two additional factors may call for ration increase: nutritional catch-up and post-distribution losses. # Nutritional catch-up Nutritional catch-up is costly. Weight gain of 1 g of tissue that contains an average of 16% of protein and 25% of lipids involves in the process a consumption of approximately 5 kcal (21 kJ) (WHO, 1985 andWaterlow, 1982).
