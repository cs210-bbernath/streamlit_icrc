"used for controlled, unpaired studies, and is applied when a variable is measured for an entire population. Since an epidemiological investigation cannot usually be carried out on an entire # Population Distribution on a Gaussian Curve # Mean (SD=standard deviation) 68% of the population falls between -1 SD and +1 SD 96% of the population falls between -2 SD and +2 SD # 99% of the population falls between -3 SD and +3 SD -3SD -2SD -1SD + 1SD + 2SD + 3SD population due to the constraints of time, cost, etc., it is common to use sampling techniques. In this case, the measures of comparison must take into account the errors inherent in the sampling process. # Sampling Tools To be considered representative, a sample must adhere to the rule that ''at the outset, all the subjects composing the target population must have the same probability of being included in the sample.'' 21 # Types of Sampling Various sampling methods are possible. & Simple random sampling: For example,"
