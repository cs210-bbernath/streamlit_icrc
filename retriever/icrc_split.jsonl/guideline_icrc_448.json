"= z (x) SD/Hn n = z 2 (x) SD 2 d 2 28 This value can be rounded up to 2. Since z will be part of the numerator of the formula for calculating the size of a sample, the size will be slightly increased -which helps rather than hurts. 29 According to Lwanga and Tye, ''Estimating Population Values,'' in Teaching Health Statistics, pp. 68-70. 30 Proportions in the framework of a sample to study a proportion p of subjects with the characteristic sought, in relation to the proportion q (since they are proportions, q = 1p) of subjects who do not have that characteristic. In this case, the standard error is equal to the square root of the complex pq/n. The value of this proportion is unknown and must be estimated, although logical minds have trouble accepting the idea that the value to be calculated must be estimated in advance. If we have no idea of the value of p,"
