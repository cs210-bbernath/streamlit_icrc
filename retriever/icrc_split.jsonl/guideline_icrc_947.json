"normally resorted to, and their appearance during the impoverishment phase is an indication of deterioration itself. The analysis of Table 10.1 invites the following observations. Gathering varies like agriculture, which is logical in drought; the labour supply is inelastic; social obligations do not vary according to the severity of crisis; petty trade is not a seriously considered option (possibly because resorting to it signals economic diffi culty, and thus promotes speculation); this population does not rely heavily on credit. These observations must then be verifi ed in the light of the real potential of each option. In order to confi rm hypotheses as to the impact of specifi c phenomena, and in order to verify how resilience activities are resorted to, the population is requested to describe the recent history that has led it from normality to its present circumstances. This is done by drafting a calendar and a detailed description of experienced phenomena and diffi culties, and the reaction they prompted. An example is provided in Table 10."
