"# Synthesizing information This section describes a three-step process for synthesizing information from different sources and presenting the conclusions in a format that is useful to programme planners. Each step consists of a table, together with notes explaining how to complete it. This process is based on the vulnerability and capacity framework. # Step 1 Notes List all the problems identified during the assessment. Be specific. Do not say that the problem is \"floods\". Do say that the problems caused by the floods are, for example: I loss of life; I injury; I destruction of houses; I contamination of drinking water; I other. Problem ranking: Did all informants agree about the ranking of problems? If not, give details (which problems were considered most severe by each group of informants). # Other comments on information in the table: Notes Identify the population affected by each of the problems identified in Step 1. Describe each population. For example: \"the people who live near the river\"; \"the residents of village X\";"
