"designation of lead agencies and complementary or support agencies for each aspect of the problems; 9 cooperation, consisting of the effi cient sharing of resources and services. Field coordination is a powerful tool in determining inter-agency relationships. It cannot be imposed, but should be freely adopted, and it must be horizontal and not vertical. Finally, the coordinating agency or person must, if possible, be chosen by the agencies involved, and must be directly involved. All too frequently, coordination structures in the fi eld are dominated by one agency or person, without them being directly involved in the fi eld operations. This must be avoided at all costs. However, other systems allow for rotating chairmanship, in which each meeting is based on a clear, pre-agreed agenda that promotes fl exibility and cooperation. Such systems clearly do not exclude non-member agencies (such as those not directly involved). This type of system is the best and most constructive by far."
