"an influx of patients who expect the world of us, naturally including curative services. As our activities are limited in time, we must select the patients who are in the most serious condition and for whom something can be done. This is known as \"triage\". Failure to carry out triage creates confusion and jeopardizes our very presence, from the security as well as the qualitative viewpoint. Without proper triage there can be no efficient MHU. This stage, which at first sight appears to be a minor matter, is the most complex in the work of an MHU. The basic principles of triage (both medical and surgical) are as follows. 1. We are limited by the means at our disposal (time, services, human resources, etc.). So we cannot do everything for everybody. 2. Our aim, therefore, is to achieve the best possible results for the greatest number of people. These two points appear obvious, but they are real stumbling blocks in the field. 1."
