"symptoms who shows up for consultation. Treatment is often empirical. # Treatment of Suspected or Confirmed Cases The advent of short treatments for most intestinal parasitic diseases has simplified the therapeutic approach to amebiasis (Fasigyne), and ascariasis and hookworm (Albendazole). # Mass Treatment According to WHO, 119 mass treatment can be undertaken in three ways: -treatment of the entire population; -treatment of all infected subjects, whether ill or not; -treatment of the groups most susceptible to infection. Mass treatment is justified if the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections is very high -for example, 60-70% for ascariasis. It is only realistic, however, if the population affected is limited and lives in a restricted geographical area. Otherwise, intervention will have to be targeted to specific groups, such as children admitted to a nutrition rehabilitation center. # Modes of Intervention # Managing Sequelae Managing sequelae may mean, for example, treating anemia caused by hookworm, or malnutrition (although intestinal parasites are not a determining factor)."
