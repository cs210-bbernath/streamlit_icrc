"# VITAMIN AND MINERAL FORMULA FOR SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING This formula is based on the recommendations of Golden et al. for fl our preparations used in therapeutic and supplementary feeding. The commonest commercial form is manufactured by Nutriset (supplementary vitamin and mineral complex, CMV); 24 g of this powder (i.e. 4 doses of 6 g each) are added to each kilogram of fl our after cooking. Requirements: recommended intakes are provided in Chapter IV. The reference documents are the same as for the Anthropometry Kit, in addition to the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) Clinical Guide (French and English). The above Therapeutic Feeding Kit is designed for 100 children. Should the centre accommodate more children, it is better to complete it with 1 or 2 Supplementary Feeding Kits (Annex 18), designed for 250 children, than to add 3 or 6 Therapeutic Feeding Kits. Beyond these dimensions, it is best to set up a second centre. # NUTRITION MANUAL 4.1 Reference models Chapter X -Assessment and planning 4.2 Appraising the resources I."
