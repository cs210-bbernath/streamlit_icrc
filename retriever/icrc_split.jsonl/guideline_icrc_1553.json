"< 85% or < -3 Z-scores: severe growth retardation. # Weight-for-height Advantages: a good indicator of wasting, regardless of age. Drawbacks: weight is infl uenced by variables that may alter the interpretation of results; weight is not always easily measured (see above, weight-for-age); it requires that two measurements be accurately recorded, which is not easy, and the participation of two persons; measurements are timeconsuming, as is data processing (unless results are entered into a specifi c computer programme such as EPINUT, which is also time-consuming and introduces the risk of mistakes associated with the transcription of data). Practical improvement: J. Vernet and Dr D. Nabarro of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have developed a diagram that combines weight and height and provides three cut-off points: subjects may thus be classifi ed in one of four nutritional categories. The method presents the advantage of removing the need for accurate height measurement, which saves time, human resources, and calculations. # Conventional cut-off points and classifi cation: 1."
