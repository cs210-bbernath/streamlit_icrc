"of the eye). The following fi ve indicators for minimum prevalence are used in order to determine whether xerophthalmia is a public health issue. If any one of the above signs reaches the minimum prevalence rate for children between 6 months to 5 years old, then xerophthalmia is to be considered a public health issue in the population under consideration, and preventive measures must be taken immediately. # Impact on mortality and morbidity The risk of mortality has been demonstrated to be signifi cantly higher in children who are objectively affected by xerophthalmia. The reason for this is probably a weakened response to concomitant infectious disease. Studies conducted after the distribution of vitamin A to preschool children have confi rmed this observation, with mortality drops of the order of 30%. These distributions appear to have a greater effect on mortality related to measles and diarrhoea than to respiratory infection. Studies on the reduction of mortality through the distribution of vitamin A do not associate the relative mortality risk and xerophthalmia,"
