"rations Table 12.5 below provides examples of rations that total approximately 2,250 kcal (9,400 kJ). Food shortages may occur in some cases because of the sheer number of victims, or because the logistics set-up has not yet been completed. In the fi rst case (as witnessed by the ICRC in Somalia in the early 1990s), rations may be restricted to 1,900 kcal (7,940 kJ), as defi ned by Seaman in 1988 (USAID, 1989). This ration keeps people alive, and checks mortality. In Somalia, however, rations were delivered in the form of meals, and the ICRC could ensure that all individuals received the same ration and consumed it on the spot, in order to limit redistributions and the splitting of already restricted rations. The underlying idea is that if all individuals consume 1,900 kcal (7 940 kJ), children up to 9 or 10 years of age are likely to regain an acceptable nutritional status. Adolescents are less likely to do so,"
