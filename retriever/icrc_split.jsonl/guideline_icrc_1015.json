Assessment of assessment methods 3.4 Selecting subjects Applying this to the example of a survey aimed at estimating the prevalence of parasite infection in maize crops, the total number of plants in the fi eld (N) must be estimated as accurately as possible, and the sample (n) and interval sizes (a) are then defi ned. If the area of the fi eld is one hectare (100 x 100 m), and the maize grows in rows at 75 cm intervals, and the distance between rows is also 75 cm, then the fi eld includes 133 rows, each of 133 plants, i.e. 133 x 133 plants = 17,733 plants in total (N). If the sample size is 350 plants (n), then the interval size (a) is 17,733 / 350 = 50.7."
