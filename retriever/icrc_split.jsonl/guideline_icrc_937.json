"insuffi cient, and that the population could not compensate through its economic alternatives or physiological defences. The disorders were obvious, and the defi nition of the needs for assistance was facilitated accordingly. # Identifying existing or anticipated problems Following hypothesis testing, existing and anticipated problems must be detected; this consists in demonstrating that the population's response to harm is or will be insuffi cient and/or dangerous. 9 In order to demonstrate insuffi ciency, the qualitative and quantitative gap between the available/produced means and the needs must be measured. The more insuffi cient the means are, the more the response to harm will be insuffi cient, and the more serious the problem becomes. Gaps at this level indicate an insuffi cient performance. 9 In order to demonstrate danger, the qualitative and quantitative gap between normal behaviour and the observed behaviour must be measured. The further the observed behaviour departs from normal behaviour, the more likely the response to harm will be abnormal, and the more serious the problem becomes."
