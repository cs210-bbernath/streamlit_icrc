Sensitivity is defined as ''the proportion of true positives correctly identified by a test,'' while specificity is defined as ''the proportion of true negatives correctly identified by a test.'' 9 The positive predictive value (PPV) of a test expresses the probability that an individual declared positive by the test actually has the disease. # Implications for Emergency Situations In a region heavily infested with malaria, there is a danger that anyone showing up at the local clinic with a headache will be considered to be suffering an attack of malaria, if the indicator sought is the patient's complaint of ''headaches.''
