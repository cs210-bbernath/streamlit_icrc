"the disease. The concept of prevalence is important for diseases of long duration, such as tuberculosis. It indicates the total number of patients during a given period (new cases plus cases that began before the period studied but which continue to develop during that period). 14 In the presentation of results, care should be taken to distinguish between incidence and prevalence. # Rates No conclusions can be drawn from the mere knowledge that there are 200 malnourished children in a particular population. This fact must be expressed in the form of a rate, defined by a numerator (the number of malnourished children) and a denominator (the total number of children in the age group examined). The significance of the malnutrition rate will vary depending on whether it is 400/ 5,000 (4%) or 200/1,000 (20%). The rates most commonly used in emergency situations are: . the mortality rate the malnutrition rate the rate of incidence of the most common diseases."
