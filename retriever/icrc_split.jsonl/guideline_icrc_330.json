"medical problems are more or less the same as in normal situations; only their prevalence and seriousness change. # Prevalence and Seriousness of Medical Problems Several factors contribute to the increased prevalence and seriousness of medical problems in emergencies. Prevalence is usually a function of nutritional status, environment, and the deterioration of preventive services. One of the main reasons for the potentially greater number of serious problems in an emergency is that access to medical services is impaired, particularly in conflict situations. Owing to a lack of immediate care, such diseases as meningitis and cerebral malaria are likely to prove fatal. The combination of prevalence and seriousness leads to high mortality. This idea can be formulated as follows: Prevalence 6 Seriousness = Mortality Access to Medical Care Thus, the high prevalence of medical problems, the large number of serious cases, and the reduced access to health-care services all help explain the particularly high mortality rates found among displaced populations before an intervention takes effect. As an example, M."
