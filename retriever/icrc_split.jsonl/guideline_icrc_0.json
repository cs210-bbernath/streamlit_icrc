"# PHYSICAL REHABILITATION Physical rehabilitation helps restore the functional capacity of people who have lost limbs or injured spinal cords, allowing them to carry on as normal a life as possible. It includes both the provision of arti cial limbs and other assistive devices which can restore lost capacity and physiotherapy to enable patients learn how to use these assistive devices. It enables people with disabilities to resume their lives independently, to work and to reintegrate into family and community activities. # ICRC SUPPORT In 2004, the ICRC in cooperation with the International Nepal Fellowship (INF) started assisting the Green Pastures Hospital in Pokhara. The institution extended its support to the Yerahity Rehabilitation Centre run by the Nepal Army in Kathmandu in 2009. These rehabilitation centres are provided with nancial assistance, supplies, equipment and the consumables for fabricating arti cial limbs."
