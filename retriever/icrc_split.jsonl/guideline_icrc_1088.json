"according to cross analysis. This provides a synthetic representation of the groups that are considered to be most at risk, that is, those located above the diagonal connecting the lower left-hand corner and the upper right-hand corner of the matrix. The diagonal may be moved upwards for greater specifi city, or downwards for greater sensitivity. The relative vulnerability hypothesis is then tested. The relative vulnerability matrix is an assessment tool; in the course of hypothesis testing, it becomes an analytical tool and, following hypothesis confi rmation, a presentation tool. Constructing a relative vulnerability matrix requires that diversity be qualifi ed in terms of: 9 vulnerability factors; 9 population types; 9 ability to cope with crisis, that is, resilience. It also requires the formulation of hypotheses relating to problems caused by crisis and their consequences. The matrix permits the identifi cation of priorities according to operational content, location, and benefi ciaries. Table 10.5 below provides a theoretical example of a relative vulnerability matrix in relation to Sahelian conditions."
