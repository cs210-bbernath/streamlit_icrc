"63 Establishing drug sensitivity is possible 61 This process is based on parasitological observation of a sampling of patients who undergo certain tests (for example, a malaria smear) before treatment; every day for seven days the degree of resistance is assessed according to the WHO classification system: . No parasites from day 6 and no new developments on day 7 -the parasite is amenable to treatment. . The parasites disappear during treatment but reappear on day 7 -the parasite has an R I resistance. . The parasites decline in number (to 25% of the initial level) but do not disappear at the end of 48 hours -the parasite presents an R II resistance. . The rate of parasites remains unchanged or greater than 75% of the original rate -the parasite has an R III resistance. 62 Practical Chemotherapy, Report of a WHO Scientific Group (1990), 91. 63 The laboratory is best reserved for in vivo tests, which will make defining an effective treatment easier. during an emergency,"
