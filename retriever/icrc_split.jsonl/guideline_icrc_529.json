"selectivity of the intervention. These are isolated programs such as emergency mass immunization campaigns, nutritional rehabilitation programs, water supply projects, and so on. Such programs respond to a vital need, such as the immediate immunization of all vulnerable subjects against measles, the provision of drinking water to a population as quickly as possible, or the treatment of malnourished people to keep them alive.
