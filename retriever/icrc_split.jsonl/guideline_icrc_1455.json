"supervise stocks and eliminate uninvited visitors and food commodities that have become unfi t for consumption. Some foodstuffs must be processed specially in order to protect them from rotting and mould; options include salting, drying, smoking, sterilization and/or preservation in a special medium such as brine, vinegar, sugar, alcohol, or fat. Such processes are however not without risk if they are performed domestically: utensils must be kept perfectly clean, foodstuffs must be washed and peeled carefully, and they must be prepared with previously boiled or safe drinking water. Preserved foodstuffs must then be regularly checked, spoiled items and traces of mould must be removed, and preservation ingredients added. # Choosing foodstuffs Only quality foodstuffs must be selected according to the following criteria. The wrapping of deep-frozen foods must be intact, and the expiry date must not be past. Deep-frozen foods must be thawed in their intact wrapping, sheltered from contamination (especially from fl ies). Thawed foods must not be refrozen."
