"VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS The following is adapted from F. Grunewald (Grunewald, 1997). Victims of a crisis do not all suffer identically because their vulnerabilities differ. In other words, the need for assistance is not equally signifi cant and urgent for all, and those that face the greatest risk must be identifi ed accordingly. To this end, hypotheses are formulated as to the relative vulnerability of different groups with respect to a given phenomenon (e.g. drought); population categories are then ranked by order of decreasing vulnerability (e.g. in relation to their distance from the droughtaffected area, or on the basis of functional classifi cation). The features that appear to be most important in mitigating vulnerability (e.g. the type of livelihood) are then determined and ranked according to their contribution to needs coverage. Finally, these two classifi cations are combined in an analysis matrix whose boxes indicate dwellings and their number of inhabitants, according to cross analysis. This provides a synthetic representation of the groups that are considered to be most at risk,"
