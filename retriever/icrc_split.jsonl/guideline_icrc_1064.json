"and medical science, values lying outside this bracket are considered as abnormal or pathological. The expression of the index in standard deviations or Z-scores is as follows: -bserved value -median - ---------------------= weight-for-height index in standard deviations or Z-scores standard deviation In the above example the standard deviation below the median is 1 kg, therefore: (8-11) / 1 = -3 standard deviations or -3 Z-scores All the above calculations require the use of reference tables indicating the median, standard deviations, and centiles or anthropometric data processing computer programmes. # Anthropometry in children Weight-for-age or Gomez index Advantages: a good basic indicator that combines ponderal and statural growth and is useful in the monitoring of programme performance; sensitive to slight variations (although many variables can account for weight changes). Drawbacks: does not distinguish wasting from growth retardation (stunting), because a tall, lean child may refl ect the same weight-for-age ratio as a short, stout child; it requires accuracy in setting age, which is usually diffi cult to ensure;"
