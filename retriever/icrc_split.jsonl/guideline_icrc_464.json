"The standard error of the difference is calculated as follows: Combined variance of the two variances of each sample s = (n 1 -1) (variance 1) 2 + (n 2 -1) (variance 2) 2 n 1 + n 2 -2 Standard error of the difference = sH1/n 1 +1/n 2 The t test formula becomes: t = Difference between the two means Standard error of the difference EPIDEMIOLOGY Logically, as the value of t increases, so does the probability of exceeding the limits of the confidence interval (between which 95% of the means of a single population should fall), and so does the certainty that the means observed in fact belong to two different populations -although always with some probability of error. The computation of this probability will depend on the value of t and the degree of freedom. Tables are available for this. Thus, where t = 2.179 and the degree of freedom = 12, the probability of error is 5%, when the two populations are different."
