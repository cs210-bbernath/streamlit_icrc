"watersupply techniques. This study will follow a logical progression, from the identification of potential water sources up to the moment the water is consumed by the individual. # Water Sources # Evaluation of Water Sources The purpose of evaluating water sources is to determine the best source of water supply in a given situation. As shown in the diagram, water may fall from the sky (rain), lie on the earth's surface (rivers, lakes, swamps), or be contained within the earth (ground water). A certain number of criteria can be used to judge the value of a water source in advance. These criteria are: -the quantity of water that the source can provide. The techniques used to estimate this quantity vary according to the type of source: . rain -quantity is measured by the volume of precipitation and the surface on which it falls; . well -the quantity is measured by the time the well takes to refill after depletion.
