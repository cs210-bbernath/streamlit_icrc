"the # The themes of nutritional information 5.2 Feeding infants and small children Early in the weaning process, infant foods must be prepared specially, but the cooked foods consumed by the rest of the family may be equally appropriate provided that they are not excessively salted or spiced. As from 9 months, children should begin to eat the same foods as adults. As long as they are reasonably balanced, most adult foods are appropriate for weaning, and may simply be crushed in a sieve in order to produce a smooth semi-solid porridge. At around 2 years old, the child should be able to eat most adult foods. As mentioned earlier, infants may be spoon-fed practically as of birth. The use of cups and mugs is more complicated, and should not begin before 5 months. At the age of 2, children eat approximately half of what adults do. Their dishes may therefore be easily prepared by halving a standard adult ration and allowing the child to eat at its own speed."
