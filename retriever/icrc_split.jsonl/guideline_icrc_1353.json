This amount should be spoon-fed regularly over 12 hours in 5 ml doses (i.e. the approximate capacity of a standard teaspoon); it can also be instilled through a syringe that is gently inserted into the corner of the mouth. The total volume depends on body weight; however the individual dose and the overall duration of the process do not vary. As a result, the frequency can be adjusted, as can the number of spoonfuls that are administered at a set frequency.
