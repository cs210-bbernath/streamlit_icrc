"the number of malaria cases that can be expected, but the size of the groups at risk: children under age five, pregnant women, or the entire population. Mortality figures can be obtained directly from the population (evaluation of mortality on the basis of symptoms) and from any existing health services. # Control Measures Control programs are established on the basis of the disease cycle and with due consideration for the feasibility of the technical measures proposed. Later, any constraints limiting the use of these measures should be examined. Treating the Parasite ''Reservoir'' (Gametocytes) Ideally, screening and treating all carriers of the sexual forms of the parasite would reduce transmission. Carriers of gametocytes are not necessarily symptomatic, however, and are therefore difficult to identify at clinics or other medical centers. Systematic screening within the population is unrealistic during the emergency phase."
