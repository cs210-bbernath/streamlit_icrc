"humanitarian agencies should take note of the locally used methods and determine to what extent they should be used. # Reliability Reliability is defined as the capacity to furnish uniform results. The main elements influencing reliability are: . variations in the measuring instrument itself; . variations in the thing measured; . variations in the observer; . variations involving differences between observers. 12 Several elements influence the reliability of the measures used in emergency situations: . frequent changes in the expatriate health-care personnel, since that increases the risk of variations between different observers; rapid training of local personnel to perform simple tasks, increasing the risk of carelessness; . lack of time to plan and execute measuring activities. Simple tests are preferable, since although they may be scientifically less precise, they are also less apt to be vitiated by gross errors in application. To reduce distortions in the results, the procedures for applying the tests should be explained repeatedly. # Applicability A test's applicability means the ability to perform it."
