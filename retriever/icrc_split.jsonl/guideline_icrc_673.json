"agency offers access to care to one population group, but without accepting the discrimination against the other group. The threshold of tolerance remains to be defined, as well as an acceptable time limit for concluding the negotiations. Accept the discrimination and find another solution for the excluded groupfor example, providing a new facility for it. What should be the policy concerning a civilian population whose vital needs are not covered and who are suffering from extortion by an armed group? There are three possibilities: . Withhold assistance in order to protest the treatment meted out to the civilian population. This amounts to delivering a death sentence against the civilians, who will lack food, medical care, and other necessities, so that in fact it is the victims and not those responsible for the extortion who are penalized. Intervene without comment. This may improve the material situation of the civilian population (unless material aid is diverted by the armed group), but will not improve the victims' security."
