"necessary in order to defi ne the need for assistance, in both time and content. For example, a drought may threaten to cause famine in a given subsistence agriculture area; this threat is likely to disappear during the following rainy season if the latter is normal. As a result, action should persist at least until the following normal harvest, and will consist chiefl y of food and agricultural inputs. If famine results from the inability to cultivate owing to armed confl ict, the cause is more complicated because the evolution of confl ict is more diffi cult to predict. However, it is safe to say that food assistance must persist until its recipients regain access to their land, and that action must involve representations reminding the authorities of their duties towards civilians. Furthermore, action must be as preventive as possible, that is, address the causes of the problem, hence the need to identify them properly. In practice, the following criteria may be applied in defi ning cause and effect relations."
