"activities (for example, calculating vector capacity or using in vitro tests to determine the parasite's sensitivity to drugs), is less useful than an effort to link all these activities to the disease cycle, in order to establish a general framework for a disease-control program. # Impact of the Problem The impact of the problem depends on a number of factors. # Potential Seriousness The disease's potential to cause harm is based on several factors: -The nature of the parasite: malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum can be a major cause of death among displaced people, depending on the geographical region involved. -The presence of a vector capable of transmitting malaria. This means establishing certain facts: . whether the vector is present in substantial numbers and close to human dwellings; whether it exhibits tropism to man rather than animals; whether its way of life involves eating and resting inside or outside of dwellings. -Factors favoring transmission: . the population's way of life -specifically, the population's behavior with respect to the vector. ."
