"discussed in Chapters III and VIII. Malnourished children often suffer from sub-clinical vitamin A defi ciency. Administering a prophylactic dose upon admission, as per the Figure provided in Chapter XIII, Section 4.6.1, is therefore essential. The administering of vitamin A should be repeated according to the same Figure upon discharge from the programme. Protracted SFPs targeting entire vulnerable groups require the quarterly repetition of vitamin A administration, except for women of childbearing age as discussed earlier. # Parasite treatment Infestation by intestinal worms such as roundworm, hookworm and pinworm is so frequent that the general rule in an SFP centre is to treat all patients above the age of 1 systematically, upon admission, with mebendazole. Posology is a 500 mg single dose. # Iron and folic acid Given that the SFP ration must be fortifi ed according to recommendations in Annex 16, medicinal iron and folic acid should not be distributed in SFP centres. # Individual care Individual care mainly addresses infections calling for antibiotic treatment,"
