"particularly important in reducing the incidence of communicable diseases. The general view is that 10-15 liters of water should be supplied per person per day, but this quantity varies considerably from one culture to the next. When determining the quantities of water that should be provided for hygiene, planners must keep in mind that in many cultures water is more of a ritual element than a factor in hygiene. Climate and geological conditions affect the quantities of water that can be provided. Obviously, in desert regions where water is scarce and therefore precious, it will be doled out parsimoniously, or at least according to the minimum standards. Finally, the technical characteristics of the water distribution network influence the quantities of water used by a population. Many studies on such factors as the distances between water-supply points and the consumer's home have shown a relation between the quantity of water used and the distance the user needs to go to fetch it."
