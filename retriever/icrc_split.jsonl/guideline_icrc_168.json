"will use it, to judge whether it will be ultimately acceptable. # Technical Aspects of Extracting and Delivering Water . Rain water Rain water can be collected off the roofs in receptacles placed under the drainpipes. In emergencies, plastic sheeting distributed for the construction of shelters can also be used to collect rain water. Technological input is very minor. # Surface Water As noted previously, surface water must be considered as contaminated. Certain methods of exploiting it, can be used, however, to obviate the necessity of treating it. Such methods include, for example, sinking wells in the banks of a river, or -geographical -social -financial (i.e., whether payment is required) -safe access in conflict zones burying a filter box in the river bed. These methods are based on the principle of filtering water through soil, which will be studied later. Technological input can be quite substantial, depending on the case. . Spring Water A spring is in fact ground water that rises to the surface at a certain point."
