"processes remain reasonably unharmed. In 1971, thanks to the research of Victor, it appeared that Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff 's syndrome were in fact manifestations of the same pathological disorder, related to thiamine defi ciency. Modern reference is therefore made to the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which provides a comprehensive description of the process. In fact, most patients who develop a Wernicke encephalopathy also experience memory loss, whereas patients suffering from Korsakoff 's syndrome also present ataxic and ocular signs. Patients are assumed to develop Korsakoff 's syndrome once they have recovered from Wernicke encephalopathy. Korsakoff 's syndrome may also be occulted by Wernicke encephalopathy, and only become apparent after thiamine treatment because, unlike Wernicke encephalopathy, its response to thiamine treatment is slow, and usually incomplete. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome mainly affects alcoholics, and is commonest in Europe and North America; but it may also be secondary to any disorder that seriously affects the biological utilization of food (Davidson et al., 1979).
