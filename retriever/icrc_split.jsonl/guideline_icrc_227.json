"produces only biological manifestations without any clinical symptoms is of course fortunate for the affected subject; but if that individual continues to carry the infectious agent, he or she may pose a danger to the community by contributing to the transmission and therefore the perpetuation of the disease. # Levels of Intervention On the basis of these stages of the disease cycle, the main levels of intervention can be defined. ''As resistance acquired from the primary infection is not absolute, it follows that even immunologically competent individuals may eventually be overcome if the dose of mycobacteria is sufficiently high and persists for very long.'' Derek Robinson, ed., Epidemiology and the Community Control of Disease in Warm Climate Countries, p. 233. # Intervention at the Source Infectious agents can rarely be attacked directly in the environment; usually intervention must take the form of controlling transmission."
