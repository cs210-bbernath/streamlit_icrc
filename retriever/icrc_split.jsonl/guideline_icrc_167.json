"expensive techniques (engineering and cost criteria). . the medium-term view. Different approaches can be combined, as in emergency situations, when there is a choice between two sources; one can be quickly put to use with the help of intensive technical means, while the other requires long labor but is inexpensive. The second option would take over from the first in the medium term. Here again, forms synthesizing all these factors can be obtained. 18 Organized as flow charts, they permit the decisionmaker to judge which water source is the most suitable in a given context. The choice of a source is not as simple as it might seem at first. Not only is an evaluation of the source itself required, but also an estimation of the type of installation that may be necessary to make the source usable. In addition, planners must have a good knowledge of the community that will use it, to judge whether it will be ultimately acceptable. # Technical Aspects of Extracting and Delivering Water ."
