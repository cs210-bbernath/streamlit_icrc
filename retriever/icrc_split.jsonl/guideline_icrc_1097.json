"All types of graphic illustration require interpretation, and thus imply analysis and thought. As such, they are also sometimes useful in preparing a survey. The different forms of graphic illustration described below are all useful in presenting and analysing data. # Graphs Graphs are widely used in humanitarian action; they are useful mainly to represent distributions, the evolution of a given characteristic with respect to another parameter (malnutrition, the price of basic food commodities, etc.), and the relationship between two varying characteristics. They commonly comprise a horizontal axis (x-axis, or abscissa), which usually refl ects the independent variable, and a vertical axis (y-axis, or ordinate), which refl ects the dependent variable.
