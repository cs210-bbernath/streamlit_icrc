"can, to some extent, be prepared in advance. 9 An open-minded countenance helps to reassure informants that they really do know better, and encourages them to speak more freely. 9 Interviewers must keep control of the interview, in order to avoid answers becoming too lengthy, or the domination of specifi c individuals or groups (they may be more articulate, more infl uential, or simply have a specifi c interest in steering the interview towards a given issue -or away from it). This requires great concentration throughout the interview, and a keen observation of the behaviour of informants. Interviewers must be capable of putting an end to the conversation, even if it has not produced the desired results; interviews should not be prolonged unduly. 9 Hasty conclusions should be avoided, whereas apparent inconsistencies need not be set straight at all costs. Results that appear to contradict one another warrant further investigation on the basis of renewed interviews and rephrased questions."
