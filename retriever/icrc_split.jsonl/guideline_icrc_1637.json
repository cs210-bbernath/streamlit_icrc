"discrimination owing to its inclusion in a feeding programme, it should receive at least half its daily requirements, without expecting spectacular progress. For the other scenarios, the ration should allow the speediest possible recovery. Take the example of a 3-year-old child, measuring 95 cm, and whose normal weight should be 14 kg. Assuming that its weight defi cit is 3.5 kg and that the objective is for the child to gain 2 kg which will involve 10,000 kcal (41,800 kJ) overall, it will need to eat, in addition to the basic ration ensuring its maintenance, a ration supplying it with approximately the following: 9 1,000 kcal (4,180 kJ)/day to recover within 10 days at the rate of 19 g/kg/day; 9 700 kcal (2,930 kJ)/day to recover within 2 weeks at the rate of 13 g/kg/day; 9 500 kcal (2,090 kJ)/day to recover within 3 weeks at the rate of 10 g/kg/day; 9 350 kcal (1,460 kJ)/day to recover within 4 weeks at the rate of 6 g/kg/day."
