What reasoning, then, leads to the conclusion that prevalence measured below a given cut-off point actually refl ects pathological disorder? The following example sheds some light on the issue. In June 1985, approximately 40% of the children in the Ethiopian region of Tigre rated lower than 80% of the weight-for-height reference. All required intensive care in therapeutic feeding centres to some extent, and morbidity and mortality were quite high in such centres. At the same moment on the desert fringe in Eritrea, similar prevalence rates were recorded in children, but only very few required intensive care. The difference is explained by the fact that, in Tigre, nutritional status was estimated according to weight,"
