"the high mortality rate found in displaced-persons' camps can be easily prevented by immunization. However, the situation must be analyzed to determine which diseases should take priority and what vaccinations are possible. # Defining the Magnitude of the Problem The immediate impact of a disease is of less interest than its potential impact. Relief agencies should not wait until an epidemic of measles is declared to begin considering an immunization campaign (which by then would not be much use). This reasoning, however, does not apply to all the communicable diseases for which a vaccine exists. For example, there is no point in launching an immunization campaign against meningitis if no cases of the disease have been diagnosed in the population. The approach, then, will vary according to the disease. It should be based essentially on the following criteria: -Size of the group likely to develop the disease The size of the group likely to develop the disease depends on several factors."
