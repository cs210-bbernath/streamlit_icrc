"only be kept for two days at most. Food that is ready for consumption must be sheltered from dust, splashes, and predators. # Cooking foodstuffs Food should be cooked through, especially animal products that must be brought to a temperature of 70\u00b0C at least; milk, in particular, must be boiled. # Consuming foodstuffs Prepared and cooked food must be consumed immediately in order to avoid the proliferation of pathogens that may have resisted cooking, or have contaminated the food after cooking (for example through contact). # Keeping prepared foodstuffs In principle, cooked food should not be kept after the meal, unless this can be done at a temperature above 60\u00b0C or below 5\u00b0C. Neither option is practical (especially the sudden cooling to 5\u00b0C), and both can only be done in very small quantities. In any case, infants must never be fed items that have not been prepared immediately before."
