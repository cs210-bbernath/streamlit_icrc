"diffi cult or miserable cases should not be accepted. This rule will doubtless seem restrictive to experienced medical staff; qualifi ed staff should therefore decide for themselves, provided that they take full responsibility for prescribed treatments, and that the additional time and energy that is devoted to such cases is not detrimental to the overall TFC operation. Some subjects show particular aversion to therapeutic feeding; such behaviour should suggest the presence of specifi c pathologies such as congenital anomalies, tumours, and disorders of the immune system and vital organs. These conditions also prevail where primary malnutrition due to poverty or famine is common. Such cases must be referred to hospital facilities. The treatment of severe malnutrition occurs in three to four stages and their corresponding tasks. 1. Initial treatment: to correct mortality risk factors and metabolic imbalances, and to rectify the digestive function in order to prepare patients for a rich diet that permits quick nutritional rehabilitation. 2. Nutritional rehabilitation: to bring patients up to a satisfactory nutritional level. 3."
