"# The Diagnosis A diagnosis falls into one of three categories: & ''Symptomatic'' diagnosis Symptomatic diagnoses are made mostly at the peripheral level by nonprofessional personnel, on the basis of such symptoms as fever, cough, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. & ''Clinical'' diagnosis Several symptoms are combined to arrive at a clinical diagnosis. Such diagnoses may be relatively precise, such as diagnoses of pneumonia or infected scabies, or may be merely presumptive (fever + chills + headache = malaria 17 ). & Diagnosis confirmed by additional tests Additional tests may support a diagnosis. For example, a diagnosis may be confirmed by: -laboratory tests (to detect malaria, or to determine the degree of anemia); -x-rays (pneumonia or bone fractures); -bacteriological cultures (to determine the bacterium involved in bacterial meningitis). Analyzed in terms of the local context 18 and standard statistics on the main causes of morbidity or mortality in similar situations, the patient's symptoms in themselves are an adequate basis for proposing satisfactory therapeutic solutions. This approach, however, more empirical than scientific,"
