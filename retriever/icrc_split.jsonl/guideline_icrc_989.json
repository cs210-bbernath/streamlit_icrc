"cases during a given period incidence rate = - -----------------------------------\u00d7 # overall number of individuals at risk Incidence rates enable the calculation of relative risk, which is the risk faced by subjects who are exposed to a phenomenon (or risk factor) as compared to subjects who are not. Relative risk is expressed as follows: incidence rate among exposed subjects relative risk = - --------------------------------------\u00d7 # Prevalence The prevalence rate is the number of cases at a given moment as a proportion of a specifi c group at risk. For example, the prevalence rate of malnutrition among children between 1 and 5 years is the ratio between the number of malnourished children between 1 and 5 and the overall number of children between 1 and 5, multiplied by one hundred to provide a percentage. The same reasoning may be applied to the prevalence of a given opinion: in this case, the ratio between the number of individuals that hold the opinion and the overall population,"
