"best reserved for in vivo tests, which will make defining an effective treatment easier. during an emergency, provided that enough of an infrastructure exists to permit tests to be read and patients to be kept under observation. There is no standard program for controlling malaria. In a situation presenting specific epidemiological (vector, parasite, population immunity), logistical, and/or political (access to population) features, health-care personnel must analyze all factors and design a control program that treats malaria as a public health problem. For example, in the case of a non-immune population arriving in a region that is hyperendemic for P. falciparum, the risk of a malaria epidemic is great. The health team must therefore coordinate curative measures -to reduce morbidity and mortality quickly -with preventive measures, which will not be immediately effective but which will help reduce the disease's impact on the population. # Reducing morbidity and mortality involves: -finding out what treatments the local authorities recommend on the basis of their experience; -diagnosing and treating cases;"
