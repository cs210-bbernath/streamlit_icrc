"on the reduction of mortality through the distribution of vitamin A do not associate the relative mortality risk and xerophthalmia, probably because of the weak prevalence of clinical xerophthalmia. The impact on mortality is more probably due to sub-clinical vitamin A defi ciency. Worldwide, 1 to 2.5 million deaths per annum are attributed to vitamin A defi ciency; severe malnutrition is an associated factor in approximately 50% of cases. However, the administration of zinc reduces mortality through diarrhoeal disease concurrent with vitamin A defi ciency by 25%. These observations confi rm the view according to which the prevention of vitamin A defi ciency is a public health priority, and that the overall nutritional status plays a major role in the prognosis of serious infectious disease in children. As a result, health and nutrition problems must be jointly addressed. These remarks also emphasize the importance of including the prevention of nutritional disorders during humanitarian operations. Measles has a particular relation to vitamin A defi ciency."
