"or habit, rather than by actual thought as to the investigated issue. Anthropometric indexes provide indicators for different conditions or risks. # Indicator of wasting As mentioned earlier, anthropometric indexes provide an estimate of nutritional status, and not a proper refl ection of a dysfunction. All the more so because the extreme form of wasting (marasmus) that results from a metabolic adjustment to an insuffi cient dietary intake, is not necessarily pathological in itself, as frequently confi rmed in famine: individuals may be very thin without actually being sick. Thresholds must be placed very low for indicators to detect specifi cally -apart from severe physical weakness -dysfunctions in the organism resulting from an insuffi cient energy intake. However, the loss of nutritional reserves impairs survival capacity; it also indicates dysfunctions of the organism and/or the feeding process, which must be addressed. As a result, it is useful to refer to indicators of wasting, which ultimately causes marasmus, and death. The most appropriate indicators of wasting are MUAC, MUAC-for-height, and weight-for-height."
