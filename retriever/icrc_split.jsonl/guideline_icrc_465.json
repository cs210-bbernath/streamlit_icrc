"the degree of freedom = 12, the probability of error is 5%, when the two populations are different. If the degree of freedom is 21 and t = 3.819, the probability of error is 1/1,000. # The p Value Epidemiological studies refer to the p value, which is ''the probability of obtaining, by pure chance, a difference greater than or equal to the one observed.'' 43 The norm is not to accept p values higher than 0.05 (5% risk of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true). Most authors prefer p values under 0.01 (1% margin of error). # Correlation Coefficient Two variables may be positively associated (both evolving in the same direction) or negatively associated (developing in inverse ratio). This association is measured by the correlation coefficient, 44 which may vary between +1 (perfect positive correlation) and -1 (perfect negative correlation). The statistical significance of a correlation coefficient can be determined as follows: ''The correlation coefficient is multiplied by the square root of the number of pairs and,"
