"questions to ponder before deciding where to set up a displacedperson camp is whether the area in question contains many sites where anopheles can reproduce. It is simpler to choose a healthier site than to have to undertake sanitation measures. If it is not possible to choose the site, the following measures can be taken to limit the vectors' opportunities for reproduction: -drainage -pruning overgrown areas, which tend to develop into little swamps -the use of anti-larval processes. There are numerous processes to develop predators of the larval forms of the parasite. 55 Another possibility is to spread a thin film of oily solution on the surface of local bodies of water. 56 These measures require the participation of the population, and, therefore, a certain stability in the situation. Moreover, to implement methods of biological control, major investigations must be carried out first, something which is usually incompatible with an emergency situation."
