"to, in this case, count all subjects and then select those (in this example, every fi fth) to be included in the sample. The underlying principle is that random selection of the fi rst subject complies with the rules of chance, whereas subsequent subject selection is simplifi ed by the introduction of an interval size. The approach may be expressed as follows: N = the overall population, say 100 n = the number of subjects in the sample, say 20 N/n = a = the interval size, in this case 5 The fi rst subject is selected randomly within the fi rst interval, in this case, between 1 and 5, say 3. Then, the other subjects to be included in the sample are every fi fth subject (because the interval is 5) starting at 3 (the fi rst subject): 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, \u2026, 93, 98."
