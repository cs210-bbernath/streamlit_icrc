"try to draw up lists in advance of those complaints which should be treated and those which should not. On the other hand, it would be technically questionable to concentrate a substantial portion of available medical resources on these cases to the detriment of other cases which, although also serious, are simpler to treat. The decision must be made on a caseby-case basis, taking into account the patient's chances of survival and the local technical capacities. This policy may seem to imply that simple medical problems of a non-serious nature require no attention. Yet many minor complaints have the potential to become major ones rapidly: diarrhea can lead to dehydration, for example, or fever may be linked to an attack of malaria. Consequently, the attention given these cases is not a function solely of the patient's condition at the time of consultation, but also of the potential risk of deterioration."
