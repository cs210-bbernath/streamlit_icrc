"a probability law that applies to quantitative, continuous, and non-limited variables. The equation of normal distribution is provided in Figure A.8.1 below. # Figure A.8.1 Probability density function Where \u03bc is the average \u03c3 is the standard deviation e is the base of natural logarithms (approx. 2.718\u2026) x is the variable under scrutiny The standard deviation value represents the variability of the variable under scrutiny (x). The graphic representation of normal distribution is also called a Gaussian curve. In the following example (Figure A.8.2), two curves are represented: in the fi rst the average value of variable x is lower than the second, but its variability is greater. # ANNEX 9 THE QUAC STICK ANTHROPOMETRIC METHOD (FROM DE VILLE DE GOYET, 1978) 1. MAKING A QUAC STICK OR HEIGHT SCALE (FIGURE A.9) 1.1 Find a 150 cm (height) by 10 cm (width) board. 1.2 Sandpaper one of its sides in order to draw gradients or fasten a ready-made adhesive tape (see below) on it. 1."
