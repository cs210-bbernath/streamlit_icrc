"protein complement in the form of legumes should be approximately 60 to 200 g (200 to 680 kcal (840 to 2 840 kJ)), according to whether the staple is in the form of cereal or a protein-poor tuber. It may be supplied by way of other protein-rich foodstuffs -what then matters is to ensure the protein equivalent of what the legumes supply, that is, approximately 15 g of protein if the latter complement cereals, or 45 g if they complement the abovementioned tubers. In both cases, correction factors must be applied that allow for the digestibility and biological utilization of protein. The following recommendations are a practical alternative to strict calculations in the case of protein complements other than legumes, and the results nevertheless lie within dietetically-safe brackets. 9 Fresh peanuts: 100 g to complement cereals, or 350 g to complement tubers. If they complement tubers, peanuts become the staple food by supplying the greatest proportion of energy; their cost and availability however may restrict their appropriateness in some circumstances."
