"involves the complete and updated census of subjects, and unrestricted access to the entire population, because all subjects must have equal probability of being selected. Census itself may be performed independently, but is time-consuming. The region under consideration may be restricted deliberately to accessible areas; and data for inaccessible areas must then be obtained indirectly. Time can represent a major constraint if the subjects are scattered and diffi cult to locate. 9 Systematic random sampling is recommended in regions where subjects are geographically distributed (this facilitates their location). 9 Cluster random sampling is recommended for large, scattered populations that may not be homogenous, without it being possible or necessary to defi ne more homogenous sub-groups. # Sample size The underlying principle here is that, whatever the issue under investigation, the size of the population from which the sample is taken is infi nite. As a result, the size of the sample is not determined by the size of the population. Exceptions exist,"
