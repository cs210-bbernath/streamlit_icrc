"manage: individuals can be targeted easily, distances are reasonable, and access to the population is ensured. The situation is quite different in the case of a population of 10,000 nomads scattered over several thousand square kilometres, without transport facilities. In such cases, the feasibility of a therapeutic programme must be thoroughly examined even if severe malnutrition rates reach 20 or 30% in children under 6 -diffi culties of access, transport, family separation, and the identifi cation of malnourished individuals are all serious limiting factors. In situations of chronic marginal problems, programmes are justifi ed if the incidence of severe malnutrition is suffi ciently regular for even small therapeutic feeding units (i.e. with an accommodation capacity of 10 to 20 patients) to operate continuously. Such units can be attached to paediatric wards, or remain independent if the main paediatric disorder is malnutrition. Unit staff can also contribute to other healthcare tasks when the TFC is less busy. # INTEGRATION INTO THE OPERATIONAL STRATEGY As seen in Section 1.3 above,"
