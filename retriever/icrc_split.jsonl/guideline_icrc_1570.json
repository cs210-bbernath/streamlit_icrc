"required type of GFD ration in order to achieve objectives and satisfy the need for aid; 9 distribution methods; 9 GFD termination criteria; 9 resource mobilization. The above issues must be dealt with systematically and recorded in writing for future reference. They are discussed here mainly from a conceptual and theoretical angle; the actual implementation of GFD and its general practical features are discussed in Section 3 below. # COMPENDIUM OF NEED AND RELEVANCE Planning GFD must rest upon a convincing demonstration of the need for the operation. This demonstration must be summarized in the planning document. It must follow assessment (usually preliminary assessment, but possibly also ad hoc monitoring depending on developments that may have occurred after preliminary assessment). Planning rests on a sound understanding of the economic problems and living conditions faced by the affected population and the resulting needs; it also rests on the demonstration that a GFD is indeed an appropriate response to one or more of these needs."
