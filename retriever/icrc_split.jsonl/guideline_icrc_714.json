"principle of intervening and to determine the forms that intervention could take. # Determining Objectives and Dividing Responsibilities between the Agencies The method for defining a humanitarian intervention's operational objectives has already been reviewed several times. As mentioned, it includes: . a definition of the health problem targeted; . a definition of the group for whom the intervention is intended, by category (displaced populations, refugee populations, resident civilian populations, detainees, wounded, etc.) and locality; . a statement of the expected outcome; . the length of time anticipated to achieve this outcome. The definition of objectives can serve as a basis for coordination between agencies. After all, if one agency defines an objective clearly in terms of the criteria listed above, other agencies will know what problems are being treated, for which group of victims, and for how long. This coordination of objectives, however, is not really satisfactory, since inasmuch as each agency remains in control of its own objectives, there is a risk of competition, of rivalry, even of conflict."
