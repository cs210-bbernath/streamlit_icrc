"it can also be active, which is faster and involves the fl occulation of particles with aluminium sulphate. Sedimentation rates vary considerably according to the size and nature of the particles in suspension. Filtration refers to a broad range of processes, which all aim at separating two or more substances. Slow fi ltration involves passing the water through sand (0.2 m per hour), so that solids are trapped, while the fl uid passes through. This principle relies upon the size difference between the particles making up the fl uid, and the particles making up the solid. The process substantially improves the microbiological quality of the water by trapping or destroying most types of virus, bacteria, protozoan cysts and helminthic (worm) eggs. Trapping and destruction occur within the top layers of the fi lter through the development of a micro-fl ora whose biological activity kills micro-organisms, whereas the formation of a layer of waste strengthens the fi lter through a clotting process (Cairncross & Feachem, 1993)."
