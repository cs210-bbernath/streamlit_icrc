"kJ) and 34 g of protein for maintenance, plus 1,125 kcal (4,700 kJ) and 45 g of protein for catch-up purposes must be supplied, that is, 2,625 kcal (10,970 kJ) and 79 g of protein in total. In line with the principles defi ned earlier in relation to the setting of rations for planning purposes (15% of the energy supplied in the form of legumes, 20% in oil, and 65% in cereals), rations that supply the calories required for catch-up and maintenance only supply 75 g of protein. Protein is therefore slightly limiting, and catch-up will only reach up to 4.5 g/kg/day. The same calculation applied to a man initially weighing 50 kg leads roughly to the same result, in which protein is slightly limiting. If catch-up is less ambitious and is limited to 2 g/kg/day, then protein is no longer limiting. In other words, protein may limit the nutritional catch-up rate in adults; in small children, however,"
