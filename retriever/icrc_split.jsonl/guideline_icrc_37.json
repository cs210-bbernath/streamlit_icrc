"the patient having access to an MHU in time is equal to the ratio between the number of days that the MHU is present and the number of days in the year (formula expressed in unit of time for a given community). Probability of a consultation : number of days that the MHU is in the village number of days in the year Therefore when we carry out vaccinations in a community on an annual basis, during four two-day sessions, the probability of the patient with acute pneumonia having access to treatment at the MHU is 2%. With a weekly presence in the same village, the probability is only 14%. In the case of a health centre, which is open every day, the probability is 100%."
