"If on the other hand the threshold is set at -4 standard deviations, the indicator is highly specifi c and discards all subjects that are not severely malnourished; but it also discards many subjects that are in fact severely malnourished. The challenge therefore lies in determining thresholds that allow for the best sensitivity index as well as the best specifi city index. The same comment applies to the use of weak purchasing power as an indicator of low food access: a high threshold provides a sensitive indicator, whereas a low threshold provides a specifi c indicator. The validity of purchasing power as an indicator of food access may then be improved by combining it with other indicators, such as the ability to gather and produce food. ----------------------------------\u00d7 ----------------------------------\u00d7 # true negatives + false positives The positive predictive value (PPV) of the indicator can then be derived from the above 2x2 table : PPV is the probability that a given subject, revealed by the indicator as sharing the feature, really does."
