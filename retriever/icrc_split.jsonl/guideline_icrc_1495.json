"balance Chapter V discusses the different food groups consumed by man; as a general rule, diets should comprise fi ve types of food. 1. One basic food (or \"staple food\", cereal or tuber). In crises, this type must be consumed in suffi cient amounts in order to avoid the development of severe malnutrition. 2. One protein food (legumes, oilseeds, meat, fi sh, dairy products, eggs). This type also prevents the development of severe malnutrition and of specifi c defi ciencies, notably pellagra and beriberi. 3. One energy complement (vegetable oil or animal fat, 15 oilseeds, sugar). This type is especially important in avoiding the development of severe malnutrition in infants. 4. One vitamin and mineral complement (fresh fruits and vegetables). This type limits the development of specifi c defi ciencies, particularly vitamin A and C defi ciency. 5. One fl avour-enhancing ingredient (garlic, onion, herbs, spices and seasoning, including salt). This type enhances usually monotonous diets, stimulates appetite, and thus helps limit the risk of malnutrition substantially."
