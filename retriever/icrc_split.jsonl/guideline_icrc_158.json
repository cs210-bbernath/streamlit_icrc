"of Water The mere presence of water favors the proliferation of insects, or water-related vectors, which transmit, for example, the following diseases: # malaria (mosquitoes) # yellow fever (mosquitoes) # dengue fever (mosquitoes) # arboviruses (mosquitoes) # sleeping sickness (flies) # onchocerciasis (flies) It should be kept in mind that water is not an isolated factor, but contributes to disease in combination with other factors: fecal contamination, lack of health education, etc. # Recommendations for Supplying Water QUANTITY: 20 liters of water per day and per person QUALITY: - Physical characteristics: -appearance -smell -taste - Microbiological constants: -0-10 E. coli/100 ml - Chemical constants: -arsenic < 0.05 mg/l -fluoride < 1.5 mg/l -cyanides < 0.1 mg/l -mercury < 0.001 mg/l -lead < 0.05 mg/l # Contact with Water In areas where schistosomiasis is endemic, mere contact with water infested by cercariae (the mature larva of the schistosoma) is sufficient for the transmission of schistosomiasis."
