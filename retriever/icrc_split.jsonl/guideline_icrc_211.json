"organizers must find out who the site belongs to and take all the necessary administrative steps with the proper authorities. # & Potential for expansion The number of displaced people generally varies considerably over time. From a few thousand people to begin with, it may reach several tens of thousands. Although it is preferable to limit camp size and build several camps rather than a single, gigantic one, it is a good idea to allow for the possibility of expansion, ''just in case.'' If the camp becomes a long-term fixture, organizers may consider initiating limited agricultural programs (vegetable gardens) or more ambitious projects (animal husbandry, farming). In this case, any camp extension must be made with the consent of the local authorities. # Selection Criteria If a choice between two sites is possible, each factor must be analyzed in the light of the situation; at one site, security may be guaranteed, while at the other, the access to health services may be better."
