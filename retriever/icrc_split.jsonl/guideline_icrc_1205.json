"catch-up rate in adults; in small children, however, the nutritional catch-up rate is usually only limited by energy because their protein maintenance requirements are lower with respect to energy 3. GFD implementation 3.2 Setting rations than those of adults. The protein requirements of a 3-year-old child are 1.15 g for 100 kcal (4.8% P/E%); those of an adult man are 1.7g/100 kcal (6.8% P/E%). Nutritional catch-up implies higher P/E% ratios than maintenance, and the P/E% ratio must therefore be approximately 10% in order to enable a 3-year-old to catch up 20 g/kg/day; this is covered by basic foods. In the case of an adult weighing 45 kg, it is in the order of 15%, which cannot be covered by standard basic foods. These remarks on catch-up requirements show that it is necessary to clarify the objective of increasing full food rations in order to contribute to nutritional catch-up. Micro-nutrients must also be supplied according to the desired catch-up."
