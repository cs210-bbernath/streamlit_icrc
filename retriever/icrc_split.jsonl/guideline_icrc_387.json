"intact. 48 A distinction is made between high-velocity bullets (800 m/s) and low-velocity bullets (150-200 m/s). The greater the velocity, the greater the amount of energy apt to be transferred into the body tissues. # Disasters The number of wounded after an earthquake depends on: . the intensity of the earthquake; 50 . population density (whether its epicenter is located in the middle of a city or in a sparsely inhabited rural area); . the degree of earthquake protection in the affected area. Constructing buildings to earthquake standards reduces seismic damage considerably. 51 # War Situations It may seem obvious that the more intensive a combat is, the greater the number of people involved in it will be 52 and the greater the number of wounded. However, many other factors play a part as well: the degree to which combatants respect (or do not respect) the civilian population, 53 and the type of weapons used. Weapons now have greater blast effect and may cause delayed internal injury."
