"Emergencies Caused by Epidemics (WHO, 1989). As soon as a hypothesis regarding possible diagnoses has been formed, possibilities for testing must be investigated: What laboratory is equipped to look for vibrios? What laboratory is able to identify meningococcus? 70 For example, WHO proposes the following guidelines for identifying cholera: ''A case of cholera should be suspected when: -in an area where the disease is not known to be present, a patient aged 5 years or more develops severe dehydration or dies from acute watery diarrhoea -in an area where there is a cholera epidemic, a patient aged 5 or more develops acute watery diarrhoea with or without vomiting. A case of cholera is confirmed when -Vibrio Cholerae 01 is isolated from any patient with diarrhoea.'' WHO, Guidelines for Cholera Control (1993), p. 15. # Defining Cases 1.
