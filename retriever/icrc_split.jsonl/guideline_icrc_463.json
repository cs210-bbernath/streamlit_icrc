"there is a 95% probability that the two means obtained will lie within this interval. To try to prove or disprove this hypothesis, the t test establishes the relation between the difference between the two means observed and the standard error of the difference, 42 which is a combination of the two standard errors inherent in each average: t = Difference between the two means Standard error of the difference 40 Value of chi squared: X 2 = (O -A)2 A where O = values observed in sample and A = values expected if there were no differences between the population groups. 41 Degree of freedom: When the number of values exceeds 4, we must take account of the degree of freedom, which is the number of values minus 1 in the column of tabulated values multiplied by the number of values minus 1 in the row of values."
