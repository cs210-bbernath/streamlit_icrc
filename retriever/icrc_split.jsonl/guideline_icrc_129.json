"hygienic and environmental sanitation measures, and treatment of severe cases in an existing facility (for example, a hospital). . Zone 4 + Zone 3, many cases of moderate and severe malnutrition: supplementary feeding and environmental hygiene measures for the moderate cases, and treatment of severe cases in therapeutic feeding centers especially designed for that purpose. # Classification of NRPs Nutrition rehabilitation programs can be classified according to the number of meals beneficiaries receive per day, ranging from four to eight. Experience shows that they can be divided into two categories: & Category I -This program provides four to six meals a day. & Category II -This program offers beneficiaries up to eight meals per day, as needed. This constitutes a therapeutic feeding program. Nutritional programs that offer only two meals a day are inadequate to effect satisfactory cures for the severe forms of malnutrition. This outline provides a basis for planning the facilities that will be needed. At this point nutrition rehabilitation centers (NRCs) come into the picture."
