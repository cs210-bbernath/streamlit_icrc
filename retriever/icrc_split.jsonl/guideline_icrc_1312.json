If only turbid water is available and cannot be purifi ed, it can only be disinfected by boiling, after decantation for as long as possible, and this depends on the availability of water tanks. The water supply point must be protected in order to avoid contamination (Annex 12 briefl y describes the methods for the improvement of water quality). For the sake of safety and autonomy, the TFC should be equipped with one or more tanks to allow for water shortages. If water points are distant and there is no pipeline available, catchment, transport, and storage systems must be devised; clearly then, all the links in the supply chain must be absolutely reliable. As an indication, a TFC should at all times maintain at least a one-week reserve of water.
