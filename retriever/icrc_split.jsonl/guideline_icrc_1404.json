"TREATING ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS As discussed in Section 3.2 in relation to admission criteria, only very severely malnourished and sick adolescents and adults should be admitted to a TFC (which is normally reserved for children), provided that their sickness can be cured within the TFC. However, if large numbers of adolescents and adults are severely malnourished (as can be the case in famines), it is best to establish special facilities for them, in the form of a highly simplifi ed TFC. Adolescents and adults suffering from primary severe malnutrition are less fragile than young children, do not depend on a carer to feed themselves, and recover the ability to consume normal food faster. They usually recover and their digestion is restored within a few days -as a result, they can consume GFD foods almost immediately. The TFC admission criteria for adolescents and adults should be: 9 adolescents: weight-for-height index below 70% (according to the table provided in Annex 4.4 for adolescents); 9 adults: BMI below 14."
