As such, triangulation reinforces the concept of optimal ignorance. Triangulation consists in combining different sources and means to obtain information. Accuracy and the completion of assessment are achieved by resorting to several indicators, each of which requires the use of different sources of information. Reality appears as assessment progresses, by corroboration, convergence and consistency of the information obtained, by combining indicators and the different sources of information pertaining to each indicator. Until data is corroborated, contradiction and divergence must be investigated by reviewing the initial hypotheses, by reformulating questions, by consulting stakeholders as to these contradictions and divergences, and by seeking to identify misunderstandings related to perception and language. Triangulation is clearly optimized by resorting to multidisciplinary assessment teams."
