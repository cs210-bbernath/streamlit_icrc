Type II micro-nutrients must be supplied in the stoechiometric amounts defi ned in the following Chapter. It is pointless to increase only the protein and energy content of rations if adequate catch-up is sought. Experience in nutritional centres before and after the introduction of the Briend & Golden Protocols (Briend & Golden, 1993) on micro-nutrients shows a catch-up jump from 2-3 g/kg/day to 15-20 g/kg/day for equal amounts of protein and energy, in identical conditions. 22 Post-distribution losses GFD benefi ciaries can suffer commodity losses, for example in the course of cereal milling (if it is distributed in grains), and despoiling. In the case of milling, loss is determined by the type of milling itself and the cost involved. According to the type of mill and local eating habits,"
