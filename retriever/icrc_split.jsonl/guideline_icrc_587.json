"major geophysical phenomenon (earthquake, volcanic eruption) occurring. Moving these populations elsewhere is practically unthinkable, not only for purely sociocultural reasons, but also -and especially -for economic reasons; this is true primarily of populations living close to volcanoes, 35 rivers, and deltas. 36 This interaction is still more complex when disasters give rise to mass population displacements; they break up the social fabric, cut people off from their normal sources of food, expose them to a new microbiological environment, etc. These factors interact at several levels and may create a real chain reaction. Thus, latent malnutrition (individual vulnerability) and agricultural underdevelopment (economic vulnerability) combine to create a nutritional disaster (exercising its impact on the groups that are already malnourished) in the wake of a drought (phenomenon). The drought itself may be considered as the result (impact on agricultural regions) of a phenomenon (drop in rainfall) in areas already ecologically devastated by erosion, deforestation, the absence of irrigation works, etc. (economic vulnerability). In the first case,"
