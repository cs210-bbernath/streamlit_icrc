"subsequently be instituted to immunize those children who were under the age of six months at the time of the mass campaign. Despite these precautions, immunization coverage is never complete. Certain children outside the target group may not be immune, and develop the disease; others, although within the designated age group, miss the vaccination for one reason or another. Moreover, the fact that an immunization campaign has been carried out is no guarantee that a correct level of immunity has been achieved. Besides all the technical problems involved in the immunization campaign itself (effectiveness of the cold chain, vaccine efficacy, etc.), the percentage of seroconversion is in any case only some 90-95% in vaccinated subjects. In camps, controlling measles is an imperative, and the aim must be to immunize more than 95% of the population if measles is to be eliminated. 69 In unstable populations, notably in the case of uncontrolled migration, it is unrealistic to try to eradicate measles; but this is no reason to postpone immunization."
