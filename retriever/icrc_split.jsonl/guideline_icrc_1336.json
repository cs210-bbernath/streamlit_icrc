"inventories and stock maintenance are all necessary in order to limit complications and temptation. # Anticipation of needs Needs are anticipated according to weekly or monthly consumption patterns; this type of management allows for buffer stocks according to potential breakdowns in the logistics chain, and implies that orders be placed on time, according to usual delivery delays. While buffer stocks are necessary to allow for possible supply breakdowns, they must nevertheless be kept to a minimum to discourage looting. Storage conditions (heat and humidity) may also preclude the maintenance of large stocks. # Stock-fl ow monitoring The systematic recording of the incoming and outgoing commodity fl ow provides an accurate overview of stock positions at any one moment. # Physical inventories Inventories are performed at least fortnightly, and involve the physical counting of all commodities that are present in the warehouse. Resulting totals are compared with stock card entries, permitting the application of corrective measures if necessary."
