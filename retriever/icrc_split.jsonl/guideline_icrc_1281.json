"four or fi ve well-spaced snacks for infants; this often gives rise to problems, especially after weaning. Soup kitchens involve heavy workloads for a smaller yield than that of take-away GFD rations. A GFD in the form of soup kitchens is therefore only an option in quite specifi c circumstances namely the following. 1. The benefi ciaries cannot prepare their own meals because they lack the necessary space or material (such as cooking utensils and fuel). The provision of fuel is a major problem in GFD, and can cause widespread environmental damage because humanitarian agencies tend to neglect this fundamental aspect. Operating agencies must rather ensure that the use of fuel does not result in deforestation or the exhaustion of natural resources to the detriment of local populations, and does not give rise to tension. 2. Security conditions prevent benefi ciaries from taking rations home (as was the case in Somalia between 1991 and1993); prepared food on the other hand loses much of its appeal for human predators."
