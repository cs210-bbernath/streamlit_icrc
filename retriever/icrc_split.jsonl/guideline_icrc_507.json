Intervention must take place before the beginning of great migratory movements, which are usually accompanied by high mortality. Migration in fact begins when the crisis is already serious, and the migration is in itself an additional source of stress for the physiologically most vulnerable groups. Theoretically, then, it is at the moment when the EWSs begin to produce signs of agricultural and economic crises that aid interventions should be planned. The implementation of this principle, however, is hindered by several obstacles: # Indicator unreliability Locally recorded agronomical indicators are fairly reliable, but give a geographically limited view of the scope of the problem. In contrast, a satellite picture of the region gives an overall view, but does not lend itself to accurate analysis. # Lack of resources Anticipating disasters is not high on governments' priority lists; they prefer to focus resources on programs that have an immediate impact,"
