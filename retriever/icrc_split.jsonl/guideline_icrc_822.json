However, humanitarian agencies can contribute temporarily to the prevention of defi ciency, through massive and systematic vitamin supplementation in the areas where they are active, by the blanket distribution of vitamin A capsules to all children under 10 years of age. 40 Vitamin A can be stored in considerable amounts in the liver. The recommended amount is a single oral dose of 100,000 IU (55 mg of retinol palmitate or 33 mg of retinol acetate) for infants between 0 and 12 months; a single dose of 200,000 IU (110 mg of retinol palmitate or 66 mg of retinol acetate) for children between 1 and 10 years old. Prevention should be avoided during pregnancy, but a single 200,000 IU dose should be administered immediately after delivery. Women of childbearing age (pregnant or not) should ingest no more than 10,000 IU per day."
