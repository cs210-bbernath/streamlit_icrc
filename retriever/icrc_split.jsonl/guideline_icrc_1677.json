Food which is inappropriate for whatever reason causes suffering for the victims of the disaster, embarrassment and frustration for those responsible for their distribution and brings well-earned discredit on the agency responsible for the donation. Thus it is the ICRC/League's responsibility to ensure as far as possible that any appeal for food assistance is both necessary and appropriate before sharing that appeal with National Societies and other donors. The ICRC/League in coordination with other relevant agencies are also responsible for establishing the energy and nutrient content of the rations, indicating the suitable food items to achieve this. They must also ensure that the response is in line with policy and that distributions of each donation are carried out fairly, effi ciently and economically. All offers of food assistance must be cleared by ICRC/League and accepted by the operating Society. # B) General principles 1."
