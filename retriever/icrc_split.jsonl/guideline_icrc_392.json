"the field should be reasonably safe. # Human Resources Triage is above all a decision-making process which demands experience on the part of those who assume this responsibility. The head of the team must not only be experienced, but must also exert a moral authority over the rest of the team so that his or her decisions will not be challenged. The decisions as to who does what should not be made in the field; all procedures and responsibilities should have been defined in advance in a contingency plan for receiving large numbers of casualties. # Material Resources Material resources are usually commensurate with the skill level of the triage team. They also depend on the remoteness of the scene of action and the conditions of evacuation (duration, types of transport, etc.). Equipment should be ready in advance so that triage teams lose no time during the emergency. The injured should be ''labeled'' with standardized cards which are prepared in advance and familiar to all personnel, including the surgical unit."
