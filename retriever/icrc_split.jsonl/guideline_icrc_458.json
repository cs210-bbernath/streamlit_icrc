"further and further the points at which the two populations are declared different, at the same time the probability of declaring different populations identical (type II error) increases. Traditionally, the tendency is to control type I errors. 37 In this case, the initial hypothesis will be that the two populations are identical (null hypothesis). The 37 ''In fact, for a predetermined sample size, when we reduce the probability of making a type I error, we simultaneously increase the probability of making a type II error. In order to make both error probabilities arbitrarily low we would have to increase the sample size. For this reason we must choose which type of error we want to reduce; the convention has been to always control the probability of making a type I error.''
