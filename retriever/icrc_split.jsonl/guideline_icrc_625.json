"for a ban on anti-personnel mines and earnestly hopes that others will do so before the Review Conference itself.'' Statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (24 Oct. 1994) Civilian populations suffer in particular in situations of armed conflict; forced displacement, extortion, and assault are all frequent violations of international humanitarian law. The situation of prisoners, wounded, and shipwreck survivors is often particularly precarious. Nor should the impact of armed conflict on local systems be forgotten: . disruptions of the economic system; in some rural areas, landmines restrict access to agricultural land. . destruction of social infrastructures such as hospitals, water-supply services, etc. . impairment of the social fabric, including disruption of normal mechanisms of mutual aid. . destabilization of political structures, leading to a loss of control over the main functions of the State: police, justice, armies. All these disruptions affect noncombatants -especially since many countries have underlying structural deficiencies to begin with, which are aggravated by armed conflict."
