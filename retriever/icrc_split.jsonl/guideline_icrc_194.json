"approach should be ''tridimensional'': -Depth -The main risk is that the waste from the latrines will contaminate the ground water. The bottom of the pit should be two meters above the water table. 44 -Distance -Two factors are essential. First, the latrines must be far away from water sources, especially wells, to prevent contamination. 45 Second, they must be quickly accessible -though the problem of odor should be taken into account as well. Both these factors can be accommodated by building the latrines fairly close to the users' dwellings, but downwind. -Conditions inside -A latrine should offer safety and comfort: its users, especially children, should feel secure; 46 and it should be sufficiently spacious and kept clean to encourage use. The type of materials used will depend on their local availability. Nevertheless, the aim must be to build latrines of good quality. A pit latrine consists of a pit three meters deep and one meter wide, a platform (of cement, if possible) and a superstructure built with local materials."
