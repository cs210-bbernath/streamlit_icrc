"from an iron defi ciency within the organism, but can also arise from dietary folic acid defi ciency (its second most important cause), or defi ciency in vitamin B 12 and protein. Vitamin A, C, E, B 6 (pyridoxine), and copper defi ciency also contribute to anaemia. In developing countries, the average prevalence of anaemia caused by iron defi ciency among women of childbearing age is approximately 40%, against 12 to 18% in industrialized countries. Whatever its cause, anaemia indicates that haemoglobin levels in the blood are too low for the organism to function adequately. Haemoglobin is a protein comprising four sub-units, each containing a haeme group to which iron is fi xed. The haeme group gives blood its typical deep red colour. Haemoglobin iron contributes to the transport of the oxygen required for the aerobic production of energy. Haemoglobin is contained in red blood cells; the life span of these cells is short (some four months),"
