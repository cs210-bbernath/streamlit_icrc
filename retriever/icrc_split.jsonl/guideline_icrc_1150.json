"food (e.g. milling facilities, fuel, cooking utensils), access to safe drinking water, and access to other goods and services essential for survival. # BENEFICIARY SELECTION In principle, benefi ciaries are selected in the course of preliminary assessment, when populations requiring assistance are identifi ed. However, all households may not need to be included in a GFD; targeting individual households is not always possible, either because cut-off points are diffi cult to set or because targeting is not acceptable or tolerated. The issue of targeting is discussed further in Section 3.3 below. # OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED IMPACT As discussed in Section 1.3 above, a GFD may serve different purposes separately or in parallel; planning must specify this or these objectives clearly. This encourages planners to examine the relevance of the GFD closely (thus enabling the anticipation and prevention of possible negative effects), and to identify indicators required for monitoring and evaluation beforehand."
