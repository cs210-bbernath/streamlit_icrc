"geographical area. In Burkina Faso, meningitis is considered to have reached epidemic proportions when the rate of meningococcal meningitis is greater than 15 cases per 100,000 people per week for two consecutive weeks. Similarly, a 20% increase in the number of cholera cases in Bangladesh is business as usual, but a single case of smallpox is the beginning of an epidemic! The Alarm Signal The alarm may be sounded by: . the population itself, which notices spontaneously an unusual number of deaths following fever (malaria), rash (measles), diarrhea (cholera), or other symptoms. . the surveillance system, which shows a significant increase in the number of cases of a particular pathology; . rumors of unknown origin to the effect that people are dying. The reliability of such an alarm depends on its origin. By definition, information furnished by a surveillance system is more credible than rumors. Whatever the source of the alarm, however, an investigation will have to be undertaken to confirm or disprove the initial reports."
