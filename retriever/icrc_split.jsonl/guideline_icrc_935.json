"being signifi cantly restricted, it was clear from the onset that any assistance operation would meet with substantial constraints. Once in the fi eld, the rumours of drought and famine were confi rmed, without it being possible to verify their effects unless direct access was possible. The following hypothesis resulted: drought did exist, but its effects required verifi cation owing to the population's well-known resilience thanks to hunting, gathering, and fi shing. It was therefore not necessarily vulnerable to the drought phenomenon, which would then have had little impact on the performance of the people's feeding process. In reality, the fi rst visit to a village revealed generalized signs of severe malnutrition. The approach was adjusted accordingly, malnutrition was measured in order to calibrate the existing harm, and the hypothesis was formulated according to which malnutrition resulted from the drought, and revealed famine (it could have revealed contagious disease)."
