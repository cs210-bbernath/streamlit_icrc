"one environmental factor involved in the transmission of communicable diseases. For example, water may be polluted at its source by human waste, or at the point of distribution, by hands soiled with fecal matter. The absence of personal hygiene may itself be a consequence of lack of water. # Technical Implications It is particularly important to understand the nature of this interaction, which in various ways governs the balance between a population and its environment. Its implication is that no single factor (water, waste, housing) can be grasped without due consideration of the others. The most typical example is technical measures designed to protect sources of potable water. They can be really effective only if other measures are taken at the same time to control human waste and to promote personal hygiene. Practically speaking, an isolated sanitation measure which is not integrated into a comprehensive plan will a priori have little impact on a population's health status."
