"observe the condition of the benefi ciary, and report any problem to medical staff immediately. The health status of patients undergoing treatment should normally be monitored daily, and developments recorded on personal monitoring sheets. Deaths and their cause are recorded. # Monitoring attendance It is essential for attendance to be regular in order to ensure adequate feeding and care. Attendance is monitored at each meal, and recorded in a special ledger that indicates the bracelet number and the name of the patient under consideration. Benefi ciaries and their carers must be informed of the rules governing their presence at mealtimes and medical treatment sessions, and the consequences of absenteeism. 8 # Discharge The criteria for discharge have been discussed earlier. In principle, patients should remain in the centre until their nutritional status has stabilized at the anthropometric discharge criteria for two weeks. However, a signifi cant prevalence rate of severe malnutrition can impose faster rotations, and may lead to the reduction, or even the complete waiving of this safety period."
