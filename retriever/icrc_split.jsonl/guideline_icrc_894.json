"effect a security incident perpetrated in protest. In view of the above, possible side effects (both positive and negative) must be considered already during assessments, in order to allow for them in defi ning action. Effects can never be predicted with complete confi dence, and their evolution must therefore be carefully monitored during the operation proper. The best way of dealing with predictable negative effects is to engage in dialogue with local stakeholders to secure their acceptance and support -bearing in mind that most (such as victims, benefi ciaries, authorities, organized criminals, and locals) know perfectly well how humanitarian agencies operate, and how to profi t from their presence. # ETHICS CONCERNING VICTIMS An ethical approach to victims consists mainly in preventing and alleviating suffering. Then local customs must be observed when defi ning the needs and the required assistance. Ethics also require that victims be treated as privileged working partners: participatory practices invite the direct involvement of recipients, and this is the only way of securing their active support."
