"(costing approximately 700 mg), breastfeeding (approximately 175 mg during the fi rst six months), and growth. Usually, the diet cannot compensate signifi cant and/or regular losses either. # Iron losses Two types of iron loss should be distinguished: normal loss associated with the metabolism and the functioning of the organism, and abnormal loss related to a disorder. Normal iron losses are minimal due to the organism's exceptional ability to recycle it. Daily losses are estimated at 1 mg for men, and 0.8 mg for women; during menstruation however, women lose signifi cant amounts of iron (usually of the order of 25 mg during the entire cycle, but signifi cant variations exist, related to the iron status in the organism). Because of the weak iron absorption capacity of the organism, particularly among the poor whose diet is essentially vegetarian, it does not come as a surprise that anaemia prevalence levels are particularly high in women of childbearing age."
