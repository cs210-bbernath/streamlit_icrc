"Causes of dehydration Dehydration frequently results from recent and profuse episodes of watery diarrhoea; diarrhoea is thus a good indicator in explaining substantial fl uid loss. If dehydration is suspected, the patient's recent history of diarrhoea episodes must therefore be systematically documented. In a TFC in famine settings however, dehydration may also result from non-pathological losses that are not compensated by adequate fl uid intake. This is commonly noted during admission, in patients who have travelled a long distance in the heat, without proper access to water. In other words, severe dehydration may be totally unrelated to diarrhoea or septic shock. # Preventing dehydration The prevention of dehydration during initial treatment consists in administering rehydration solutions in order to compensate excessive loss due to diarrhoea and sometimes vomiting. In the absence of these two symptoms, patients must be made to drink regularly, through breastfeeding, fl uid reanimation feeding, and drinking water. # Treating dehydration Diarrhoea that combines with severe malnutrition causes substantial electrolyte and mineral imbalance;"
