The explanation can be found in an analysis of vulnerability, particularly its social aspects: . housing, where construction does not accord with earthquake standards; 50 . health-care facilities themselves fall prey to destruction in an earthquake; . health-care facilities are ill-prepared to receive large numbers of casualties; . restricted access to health-care facilities. # Measures to Reduce Vulnerability Measures to reduce vulnerability are also generally designed to reduce underdevelopment. They include the implementation of standards, particularly construction standards."
