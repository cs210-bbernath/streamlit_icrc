"Table # PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH USING ARTIFICIAL MILK IN RELIEF ACTIONS 4.1. General: the indiscriminate distribution of artifi cial milk in relief actions instils or perpetuates the belief that milk is an essential food and threatens to change long established food habits and to create unnecessary economic pressures. 4.2. Management of supplies: as with any other food with high water content, liquid or semi-liquid milks should not be transported or distributed since the high costs involved cannot be justifi ed. (See also 4.3.1). Powdered milk in air-tight sacks or sealed tins should have a shelf-life of at least one year except for dried skimmed milk fortifi ed with Vitamin A when the shelf life is six months. This requires careful supervision of supplies. Damaged sacks or tins should not be salvaged. Contaminated milk must not be used for human consumption. Health: the health hazards associated with indiscriminate distribution of artifi cial milks in relief actions are undocumented, but have been recognized if not recorded by relief workers for many years."
