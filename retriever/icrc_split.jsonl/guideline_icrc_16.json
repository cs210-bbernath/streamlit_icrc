"slow to develop, and for preventive and health promotion activities (such as prenatal consultations and vaccinations). # MHUs are not appropriate for a public health approach It is not possible to carry out a wide range of curative, preventive and health promotion activities on an intermittent basis. The simultaneous provision of all these services in a health facility is known as the horizontal or integrated approach. Some examples : -In Colombia, MHUs provide support for the PHC services in health promotion and preventive activities (vaccination, cytology). The authorities acknowledge that the MHUs represent a stopgap solution in regions where health posts have been abandoned owing to the conflict and where the MHUs are now the only health service available. -In the Vanni region of Sri Lanka, MHUs initially provided curative services but gradually moved towards an educational function for community health workers. In Trincomalee, a Ministry of Health nurse joined the MHU team, giving prenatal consultations and administering vaccinations."
