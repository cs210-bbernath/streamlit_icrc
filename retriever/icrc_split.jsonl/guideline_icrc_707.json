"# II. Code of Conduct for Relations between Humanitarian Agencies Humanitarian interventions have evolved over the last twenty years. The era of amateurism has given way to the professionalization of the big humanitarian agencies. Although this change may have resulted in a loss of spontaneity, humanitarian operations have, in exchange, gained in efficiency. It should therefore be possible to develop a joint code of conduct for the humanitarian agencies, based on accepted professional principles -although each agency has different interests depending on its mandate, its level of development, the nature of its relations with the States, and its financial means. # Relations between Agencies Relations between humanitarian agencies are complex. They depend on the factors described below, as well as the kind of situation involved. # Concentration Major humanitarian emergencies, especially those receiving heavy media coverage, are flooded with humanitarian organizations (governmental, nongovernmental, UN, etc.). # Confusion Confusion often arises, especially at the beginning of humanitarian operations, when numerous agencies arrive on the terrain without any precise mandate or objectives."
