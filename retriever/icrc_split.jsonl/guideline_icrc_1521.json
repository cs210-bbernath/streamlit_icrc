"in a spirit of openness and cooperation so that our partners will become aware of the ideal relationship we would seek with them. # Annex 5 Annex I: Recommendations to the governments of disaster affected countries 1. Governments should recognize and respect the independent, humanitarian and impartial actions of NGHAs: NGHAs are independent bodies. This independence and impartiality should be respected by host governments. 2. Host governments should facilitate rapid access to disaster victims for NGHAs: if NGHAs are to act in full compliance with their humanitarian principles, they should be granted rapid and impartial access to disaster victims, for the purpose of delivering humanitarian assistance. It is the duty of the host government, as part of the exercising of sovereign responsibility, not to block such assistance, and to accept the impartial and apolitical action of NGHAs. Host governments should facilitate the rapid entry of relief staff, particularly by waiving requirements for transit, entry and exit visas, or arranging that these are rapidly granted."
