"exercise control over the distribution of food aid, agencies tend to control all stages of the operation systematically, sometimes going so far as to control food distribution within the family.

Interventions should be multifaceted, exploiting the linkages within complex food production systems, to provide the pastoral sector with a respite from abnormal levels of stress.'' 55 # IV.
