"two to nine years old. Together with the plasmodic index (subjects carrying Plasmodium), it indicates the type of endemic involved. 52 -The population's degree of immunity There are many tests to detect the presence of antibodies. These techniques are not very practical in an emergency situation, although large-scale studies have been made in remote regions. 53 The degree of immunity can also be estimated by indirect methods, such as measuring malaria-related morbidity and mortality. -The measurement of mortality must take account of age A mortality rate associated primarily with children below the age of five years and pregnant women indicates that the overall population, with the exception of these vulnerable groups, has a certain immunity. A mortality which is distributed among all age sectors, on the other hand, is the earmark of a nonimmune population confronted by a high level of contagiousness. This distinction makes it possible to quantify not the number of malaria cases that can be expected,"
