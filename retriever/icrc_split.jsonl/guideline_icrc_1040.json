"measure than weight and height. If almost all the subjects in a village or neighbourhood can be gathered in a central location, it is usually possible to measure them all in a matter of hours; sampling on the other hand involves counting houses or people and verifying lists fi rst, not to mention the work involved in selecting samples and sampling methods. Complete enumeration is often more acceptable for the subjects than sampling, especially if the decision to engage in assistance is to be determined by such measurements. Clearly, ensuring the reliability of results requires a good understanding of the overall population and the proportion of subjects included in the height or age category under consideration. Assuming an overall population of approximately 6,000 individuals, and a proportion of target subjects of 20%, then 1,200 subjects must be measured. The advantage is that results refl ect reality directly, and avoid the use of sampling error and confi dence intervals."
