"intake (WHO, 1988b). In actual fact, protein should account for at least 10% and at most 15% of the overall energy intake (WHO, 2003); this 10-15% bracket is not an objective: it provides a tolerance range. # The contribution of simple glucides to the overall energy intake Simple glucides are products that are used to sweeten foodstuffs, such as cane or beetroot sugar, as opposed to complex glucides, mainly the starch chains (long glucose molecule chains) that form most of the tubers, and cereal and legume seeds. Simple glucides should account for no more than 10% of the overall energy intake (WHO, 1988b). # The contribution of complex glucides to the overall energy intake Subtracting the lipid and protein contribution from the overall energy intake indicates that complex glucides should account for between 55 and 75% of the overall energy intake. This recommendation does not allow for the possible intake of alcohol and simple glucides, whose harmful effects on health require no further demonstration. NUTRITION MANUAL 5."
