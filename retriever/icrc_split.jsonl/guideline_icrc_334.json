"number of patients does not justify setting up a hospital, or if the hospital serving the area is too far away or inaccessible (due to night curfews, for example). It is essential to supply the facilities at this level with drugs in accordance with WHO norms. # Tertiary Level The tertiary level corresponds to the hospitals, both district and provincial. They represent the final link in the chain of care offered to patients. The level of care will depend on the competence of the personnel providing it and on the means available. Displaced people should have the benefit of hospital services (either local services or parallel services instituted especially for them). 8 The type of care offered at each level will be adapted to the complexity of the medical problems. It should be remembered that curative action is only one aspect of the activities carried out at each of these levels; preventive activities, for example, predominate (or ought to, anyway) at the primary level."
