"the special protection of objects that are indispensable to the survival of the civilian population; likewise, such objects (like any civilian property) must not be made the object of reprisals according to article 54 of Protocol I. Protocol I indicates that protected objects may be used in part for the sustenance for the members of armed forces; however, in no event shall actions against these objects be taken which may be expected to leave civilians with such inadequate food or water as to cause their starvation or force their movement. (article 53, paragraph 3 b). Therefore, the development of international humanitarian law is not abstract, and takes the reality of military operations fully into account. It allows for the diffi culty of ensuring an exclusively civilian use of foodstuffs, and attempts to limit exceptions to their strict minimum. An expansion of exceptions would, in fact, severely undermine the prohibition of starvation of civilians as a means of warfare."
