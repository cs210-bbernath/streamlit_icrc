Ultimately, it shows whether or not a given population is economically insecure and therefore in need of assistance. It is done by comparing a normal, baseline year (reflecting the usual conditions when the population is able to cover its essential needs) and the year in question, especially after a crisis or shock. The comparison makes it possible to determine if the population is worse, the same or better off than in the past."
