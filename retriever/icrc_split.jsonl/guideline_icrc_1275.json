Figure 12.3 below provides a typical example of a distribution point, attention desks, and benefi ciary movements. # Food distribution The distribution of individual parcels or survival rations is usually simple, as the number of parcels should amount to the number of cards. Distribution from bulk consignments (or \"scooping\", for example the distribution of fl our out of bags) is usually more quickly and often more accurately done according to volume rather than weight.

To be calibrated, empty containers are used to zero the scale, and are then fi lled with the amount of the chosen commodity that corresponds to one ration (e.g. 12 kg of cereal).
