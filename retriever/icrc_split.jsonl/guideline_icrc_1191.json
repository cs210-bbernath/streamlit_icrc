"Economic priorities usually take precedence over nutritional concerns when the amount of food is more or less suffi cient to satiate hunger. In the absence of nutritional knowledge, specifi c defi ciencies are unfortunately often overlooked, and clinical symptoms are not connected to dietary disorders in time. Moreover, if the demand for complementary foods is high, then their price rises and consequently their availability diminishes, and alternatives must be considered sooner or later. On the other hand, the exchange of part of the basic rations for complements that are considered to be essential limits epidemics of specifi c defi ciencies. This has for example been observed in Ethiopia; it is worth noting that, in this specifi c case, relative value relations (or local terms of trade) were detrimental to benefi ciaries, and severe malnutrition stabilized at high levels for many months, without prospect for improvement. That being said, the sale of part of the rations also served other essential economic purposes."
