"behaviour, and circumstances; an average catch-up rate of 15 g/kg/day is thus satisfactory. A lower than 10 g/kg/day average catchup rate however suggests problems regarding the entire centre, and requires urgent action. The same warning applies to individual patients whose catch-up rate is lower than 10 g/kg/day during rehabilitation. These considerations are clearly based on the assumption that the diet supplies all nutrients in adequate amounts -especially Type II nutrients, whose absence would limit weight gain. In Angola, before the days of the Type I-Type II nutrient theory and when adequate vitamin and mineral supplements were not available, catch-up was noted to be much lower than expected according to the protein-energy intake, and appetite loss tended to spread after approximately one or two weeks of nutritional rehabilitation. The foodstuffs were in this example powdered milk, sugar, oil, corn fl our, and beans, combined into high-energy milk (twice daily), porridge (twice daily), and one normal meal per day.
