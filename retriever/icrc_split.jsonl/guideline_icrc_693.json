"a part In the very specific example of a program to control tuberculosis, a certain number of activities can be identified, such as: . immunization with BCG; . screening for patients presenting positive sputum; . treating the cases identified. Immunization with BCG can be done separately from the other two activities. The limits of this proceeding are known and accepted. In contrast, screening for positive TB cases without preparing to treat them is a step that merits careful thought. If no treatment is to be provided, the necessity for screening is questionable. Even worse, in cases of tuberculosis, is to begin a program but stop it for lack of funds before patients have completed their treatment. Not only does the disease continue its course, but this practice is likely to increase resistance to antibiotics. # Emergency Activities and Respect for Local Norms Another problem is what to do when the humanitarian organization is certain that the local norms do not match those generally recognized as effective."
