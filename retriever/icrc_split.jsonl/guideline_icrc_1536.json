"food donations may be used at the discretion of the operating National Society. They may be sold and the cash paid to the relief operation account and used for a more benefi cial purpose for the affected population. The ICRC/League must, however, be informed about such transactions. The League/ICRC should explicitly register separately gifts in response to League appeals and those not in response. (General Assembly October 1985). In certain circumstances, changes in the operational situation and/or a very large provision of certain items by donors may lead to a situation where it is desirable for the effective management of the operation, to exchange requested food items provided in abundance for others which are in scarce supply. In this case, q the National Society/ICRC/League must consult with donors before making any exchanges; q care must be taken by the National Society/ICRC/League to avoid situations where exchanged food items become available for sale or are distributed to groups other than needy civilians and re-bagging should be considered;"
