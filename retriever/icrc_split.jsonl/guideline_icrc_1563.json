"the programme, and that operations will indeed begin on 15 July. It does not provide indications as to their nature, which remains to be defi ned in more specifi c objectives. 9 Specifi c objectives: q to distribute rations of 2,250 kcal/day to 300,000 persons in region X from 15 July up until the March harvest of the following year -the expected impact here is not reiterated, as it is clearly stated in the general objective. q to vaccinate at least 90% of the children under 6 years old against measles by the end of July -the expected impact here is defi ned indirectly by the vaccination coverage, and the indication of location would be redundant. q to ensure that all water supply points in region X provide safe drinking water by the end of October -the expected impact here is a corollary of the nature of the objective, and implies that the water is so far unsafe and its consumption thus entails a risk of secondary malnutrition."
