"the study of epidemiological programs will be limited to those phases involved in crisis situations, specifically the following: 1. initial assessment of an emergency situation 2. assessment of an epidemic 3. organization of a surveillance system 4. organization of an early-warning system. # Initial Assessment 1.1 Principles of an Initial Assessment The basic concept of an initial assessment (already described in Chapter 1) is the necessity of determining whether there is a patent imbalance between victims' vital needs and the local facilities normally responsible for meeting them. A distinction must be made between the imbalance directly caused by the circumstances of the crisis and any chronic structural imbalance between needs and services. 48 No analysis of the first kind of imbalance, however, will make much sense unless it takes the second kind into account. In short, besides the factors triggering the crisis, the underlying causes of the imbalance must be examined. This approach may have a fundamental influence on the choice of intervention type and modus operandi."
