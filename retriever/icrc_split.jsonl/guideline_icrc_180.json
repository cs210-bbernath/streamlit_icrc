"the level of free chlorine in the water. # Boiling This method of treatment is seldom used in emergencies, since access to energy resources is usually difficult and uncertain. 34 # Decision Criteria The choice between the various treatment methods will be based on the following criteria: 33 Hence the importance of sedimentation, which reduces the quantity of organic matter. 34 Half a kilo of wood is needed to boil one liter of water. -Cost: The use of chemical products requires a permanent capital investment, which some communities will not be able to afford without outside help. Sand filter systems, in contrast, once installed, can be operated without any major input of materials. -Simplicity: Chemical treatment is the most complex of all the methods. If it is misused -for example, where the optimum dose is exceeded 35 -it can lead to health problems. -Reliability: Correctly implemented chemical treatment will destroy all the pathogenic germs in the water, whereas slow filtration does not provide total safety."
