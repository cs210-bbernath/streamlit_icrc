"scales must be checked before any weighing, ideally with two different known weights. The scale is set with one weight, and the second serves to test its accuracy. If the test fails, the spring must be changed. # Height Height must be established in order to measure statural growth and corpulence. Children under 2 years old are placed horizontally on their backs, barefoot, on an accurately graduated height board, whose \"0\" value extremity is fi tted with a fi xed perpendicular head board. The child's head is held fi rmly against this board, its buttocks must rest fully on the table, and the legs are held extended by pressing on the knees. The measurement cursor lies perpendicular to the table, and is then slid against the heels, with the feet kept at right angles to the legs. The cursor is maintained fi rmly while the child is removed and its height (or length) is recorded to the nearest millimetre (for example, 65.2 cm)."
