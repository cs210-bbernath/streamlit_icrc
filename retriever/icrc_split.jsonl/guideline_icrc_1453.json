"to safe water, disposal of waste water and garbage, habitat, vector control, and climate (temperature and humidity). Clearly, if the risk of infectious disease results mainly from an insalubrious environment, then water and habitat programmes are the fi rst defence against such risks, rather than lectures on food hygiene, however convincing they may be. This example again demonstrates the importance of tackling problems through multi-faceted integrated approaches. # Poor practice resulting in food contamination The risk of consuming contaminated food is associated with the following behaviours: 9 the use of visibly contaminated foods; 9 the premature preparation of food: it increases the risk of contamination before consumption, and harmful bacteria that have resisted the preparation process have more time to multiply; 9 insuffi cient cooking, which spares parasites and harmful bacteria; 9 contamination through contact (contaminated workbenches, utensils, and hands) and transfer to other foods (cross-contamination).
