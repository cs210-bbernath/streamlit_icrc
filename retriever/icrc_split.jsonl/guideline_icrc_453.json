"to be measured and the limits between which the result should fall. The confidence level of the result obtained will therefore correspond to the desired approximation to the true value. It should be remembered that: . usually, a proportion is sought; the choice of method depends on the distribution of the population: -displaced-person and refugee camps are best suited to simple random sampling or systematic sampling; -people dispersed in little groups over large areas are better suited to cluster sampling. In this case, the problem will be to obtain an estimate of the number of people by place of residence, a preliminary condition for calculating the cumulative populations and the sampling interval. The EPIINFO computer program can be used to obtain the sample size automatically: 1. Select the function STATCALC. 2. Select the option ''sample size.'' 3. Specify: . the size of the population (e.g. 5,000) the estimated frequency of the condition sought (e.g. 15%) the lower or higher limit (e.g. 10%) 4. Press F4 to obtain the result (e.g."
