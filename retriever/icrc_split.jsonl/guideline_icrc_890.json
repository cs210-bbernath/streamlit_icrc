"Sphere Project sets minimum standards in the main areas of humanitarian action. # Humanitarian ethics 3.1 The ethics of operational practice A number of other points deserve attention; they lie somewhere between practical action and the principles for action, and contribute to the defi nition of professional ethics. # THE ETHICS OF OPERATIONAL PRACTICE The ethics of operational practice rest mainly on the professionalism of fi eld staff and the respect of procedures. # Professionalism The professionalism expected of humanitarian staff comprises training and experience in the fi rst place. In addition, considerable tact and sensitivity are essential for these two aspects to be fully exploited in the fi eld. Sensitivity is a quality that combines courtesy and respect for local customs. In humanitarian operations, the concept reaches further: it is an instrument fundamental to establishing dialogue and securing acceptance, understanding problems and, ultimately, deserving respect. When locally available skills are inadequate, staff must be trained and coached in the fi eld, and this provides the advantage of real-life conditions."
