"disorder, intolerance resulting from the suspension of milk consumption in weaned infants, adolescents, and adults, and intolerance related to a congenital inability to synthesise lactase (lactose digestion enzyme). The fi rst two types in fact combine with diarrhoea, and disappear quickly in all age groups during initial treatment. The third type is irreversible, and requires a completely lactose-free diet. It is however very rare, because subjects who suffer from it usually die young since they are unable to digest maternal milk -unless parents can secure suitable substitution formulae. Consequently, this type of intolerance is very rare in a TFC; the author has never witnessed it. Congenital intolerance manifests itself in abundant watery diarrhoea soon after the ingestion of lactose; this diarrhoea stops when the ingestion of milk stops, and resumes with it. Should such cases appear nevertheless, the patient must be fed yoghurt or a lactose-free commercial formula. However, sudden and abundant watery diarrhoea should suggest cholera rather than congenital lactose intolerance."
