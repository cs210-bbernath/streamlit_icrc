"table : PPV is the probability that a given subject, revealed by the indicator as sharing the feature, really does. PPV may be computed as follows: true positives positive predictive value = - ----------------------------------\u00d7 # true positives + false positives Clearly, in order to determine the validity of an indicator, a testing method is required. This is rarely available in the settings of humanitarian action. However, validity must always be considered in order, fi rstly, to realize the risk of error that is associated with the indicator and, then, to decide whether, given the circumstances, high sensitivity or high specifi city is preferable. # The expression of indicators Indicators can be expressed qualitatively (such-and-such an aspect does or does not exist) or quantitatively (the average wage is X; X millimetre rainfall measured during the last quarter; X individuals suffer from measles; X individuals express a given opinion, etc.). Quantitative data is often expressed in the form of rates, the commonest of which are provided below."
