"importance of supplementary measures should not be underestimated. # Monitoring Complications # Diarrheal Diseases # E. coli (16%) . shigella (11%) Interestingly, the distribution of pathogens changes with age. The age bracket in which children run the greatest risk of developing pathogenic germs is between 24 and 35 months.
