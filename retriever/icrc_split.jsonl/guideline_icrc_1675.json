"WEIGHT-FOR-AGE AND WEIGHT-FOR-HEIGHT OF ADOLESCENTS 1 In humanitarian operations, the indicator of nutritional status that must be measured is usually corpulence. Unfortunately, there are no weight-for-height tables that apply to adolescents. This Manual therefore combines existing tables for height for age and weight for age for girls and boys aged between 2 and 18 years (WHO, 1983). Results are provided within one centimetre, rounded up to the closest category as an approximate where necessary. Height rounded up to the closest centimetre is indicated between brackets alongside the approximate height. The values that are rounded up to the closest centimetre and the corresponding median weight values are underlined. The 90%, 80% and 70% thresholds are only calculated for these underlined values; calculations begin at 10 years of age. This process preserves all age, height, and weight values supplied by reference tables, and thus provides comprehensive anthropometric data. This process is not strictly orthodox, but permits the evaluation of corpulence in adolescents."
