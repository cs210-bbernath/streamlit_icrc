"in advance. If we have no idea of the value of p, we can take as our estimate p = 50%, a figure which gives pq its maximal value (0.25). Since this value is part of the numerator in the following formula, it gives the sample size its maximal value as well, taking into account accuracy and the confidence limits established. . proportion sought: 50% . degree of accuracy: 10% . confidence level: 95% the result will be a sample size of 96. 31 This is based on the following two formulas. For means: 32 The size of a sample for an infinite population may be calculated with the formulas studied above, with due consideration to the parameters of accuracy and confidence. The value found will serve next for the calculation of the size of a sample representing a finite population. n = z 2 (x) s 2 d 2 (+) z 2 s 2 N For proportions: n = z 2 (x)"
