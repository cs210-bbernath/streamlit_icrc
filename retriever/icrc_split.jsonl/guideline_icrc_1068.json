Drawbacks: the method is less accurate than the QUAC Stick method. # Conventional cut-off points and classifi cation: 9 > 14 or 13.5 cm: satisfactory nutritional status 9 14 or 13.5 to 12.5 cm: moderate malnutrition 9 < 12.5 cm: severe malnutrition. # Anthropometry in adults The index that is most commonly used for adults is the Body Mass Index (BMI) or Qu\u00e9telet index.
