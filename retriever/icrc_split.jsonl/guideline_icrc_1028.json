"adequate as of 30 values; hence, in the case of biological quantitative variables, the sample size is suffi cient if it reaches 30 values; any number above is considered to be a large sample. The result of quantitative variable sampling is expressed by an average \"m\", and its standard deviation \"s\" (m \u00b1 s). A calculator or computer spreadsheet can provide the average and standard deviation. 18 # Qualitative variables For qualitative variables, sample size is primarily determined by the sampling method. It is then infl uenced by the sampling error that is considered as acceptable, the determined confi dence interval, the expected prevalence rate (the actual prevalence rate is what is sought), and the total population when it is small. The result of qualitative variable sampling is expressed in prevalence rates \"p\" subject to the obtained degree of accuracy, which amounts to more or less a given percentage \"b\" around \"p\": p \u00b1 b%."
