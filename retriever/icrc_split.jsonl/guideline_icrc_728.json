"is also charged with ensuring the protection and assistance of the victims of armed conflicts and internal disturbances (letter d above). It has many activities in this respect, in particular relief operations for the civilian population (food, medical care, shelter, drinking water, etc.). Its Central Tracing Agency forwards messages between the members of families separated by war, traces the missing and makes it possible for families to be reunited. The ICRC has a broad right of humanitarian initiative (paragraph 2 above) which enables it to offer its services when the presence of a specifically neutral and independent institution and intermediary may help resolve humanitarian issues. For example, the ICRC has access to political detainees. The ICRC's protection and assistance activities are also conducted for people displaced within their own countries who, during armed conflicts, are protected by humanitarian law. Refugees also come under the ICRC's mandate when they are protected by humanitarian law, when they face major security problems, or when UNHCR is unable to come to their aid."
