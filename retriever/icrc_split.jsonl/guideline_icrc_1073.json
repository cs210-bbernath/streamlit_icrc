"any deviation below would indicate malnutrition. The human genetic potential cannot be defi ned absolutely, the bodily standards observed in \"well-fed\" and \"healthy\" populations are accepted as approaching this ideal. Clearly, anthropometry is infl uenced by living conditions and changes with them. There is therefore no justifi cation to penalize already precarious populations by applying growth standards that are by defi nition lower than in the wealthy West. The second school of thought promotes the use of reference values obtained from apparently healthy subjects from the directly affected population. This approach rests on two arguments: In practical terms, the lack of local tables usually obliges humanitarian actors to resort to NCHS, Harvard or Tanner tables anyway. What really matters, then, is a sound knowledge of the limitations and the risks associated with their use and, above all, not to interpret anthropometric measurements wrongly in the light of such references. This raises the issue of the value of anthropometric indicators in refl ecting nutritional status."
