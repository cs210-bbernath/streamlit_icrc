"is unavailable or unacceptable, the entire population may be injected with iodine-enriched oil, in doses that avert defi ciency for three to fi ve years. This approach is sometimes recommended for nomadic or isolated peoples, provided that medical teams have access to them. The oral administration of iodized oil is also effi cient, but its duration is shorter, between one and two years only (Latham, 1997). The oral administration of oil is clearly easier than injections, as it requires no specifi c skills or injection material (and therefore none of the specifi c precautions associated with the transmission of HIV/AIDS). In endemic goitre areas where iodized salt is the only signifi cant dietary source of iodine, foods must be salted after cooking. Cooking causes the evaporation of considerable amounts of iodine that can reach 60% if the salt is added to boiling water. # PART THREE # HUMANITARIAN ACTION The previous Chapters provided an initial approach to nutrition by developing the concepts that are most useful to humanitarian operations."
