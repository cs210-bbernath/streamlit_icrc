"aid. This issue must be seen in its true dimensions, and a distinction must be made between classic international food aid 49 and humanitarian food aid. In the first case, the volume of aid is considerably larger than in the second, and is intended to complement inadequate national production. The risks are many; the main one is that the aid will cease to be a temporary stopgap 50 and simply become a permanent substitute for national production, putting the assisted countries under the political influence of the donors. The volume of humanitarian food aid is comparatively much smaller, and therefore poses fewer economic risks. Of course, under certain circumstances, food aid may cause a fall in the prices of locally produced foodstuffs, 51 and motivate the assisted populations to concentrate on growing non-food crops. On the other hand, food aid may help revive the local market and also, in some cases, push down market prices. 52 The fifth error is ignorance of non-food solutions."
