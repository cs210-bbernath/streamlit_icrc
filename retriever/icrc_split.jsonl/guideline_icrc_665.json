"view tends to restrict humanitarian interventions to the provision of material aid, when often the victims' need of protection is even greater. In a situation where essential material needs are covered, the humanitarian agencies may be tempted to cover non-vital needs in order to maintain their presence and thereby provide a certain degree of protection to victims being subjected to repeated violations of their rights. Similarly, a non-urgent intervention to help a particular group sometimes permits access to another group of victims whose essential needs may not be covered. # Local Services As mentioned in Chapter 9, international humanitarian law assigns the responsibility for meeting victims' needs to the national authorities. In practice, application of this principle can pose serious problems. # Do All the Victims Have Access to Essential Services? If discrimination exists (based on political affiliation, ethnic origin, etc.), all humanitarian agencies will condemn it to one extent or another, but the practical problem remains: what should be done for the victims?"
