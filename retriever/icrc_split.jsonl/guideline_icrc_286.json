"the same time carrying out in vivo tests to determine the parasite's sensitivity to the drug(s) used. 61 In vitro tests clarify drug resistance, but they cannot take the place of in vivo tests. 62 The strategy used to implement curative measures will depend on local capacities (available infrastructure) and the size and distribution of the population. If diagnostic means are unavailable and malaria appears (judging by endemicity and mortality) to be a major problem, then cases presenting clinical symptoms compatible with a diagnosis of malaria will be treated as such (presumptive treatment). If the necessary infrastructure for parasitological diagnosis is available, then confirmed malaria cases will be treated in the laboratory (radical treatment). In the case of a mass influx of displaced people, many of whom are suspected to have malaria, presumptive treatment should be the first step, in order not to overload the laboratory (if there is one)."
