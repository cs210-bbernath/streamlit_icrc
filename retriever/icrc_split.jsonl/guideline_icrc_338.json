"to the mass of medical problems depends on several factors, in particular the distribution of the population. In a camp, this is a relatively minor problem, given the high population density 10 and the presence (sometimes stampede!) of health professionals. Most of the health problems are conventional ones, and a good number of them can be treated at the most peripheral level of care. An orientation based on primary health care is therefore indicated in displaced-person camps. Decentralization is essential to avoid overloading facilities at the secondary and tertiary levels (dispensaries and hospitals, respectively). It is preferable to construct a care system in which 50% of the medical problems are treated by CHWs, rather than all cases being referred to health professionals. Otherwise the latter are likely to be completely swamped, and the quality of care becomes dubious. A study on health-personnel needs in Papua New Guinea estimated that a CHW could treat a maximum of 30 cases per day, a nurse 50, and a doctor 40."
