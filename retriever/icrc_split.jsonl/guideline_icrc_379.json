"respectively 18% for CHWs-Nicaragua, 51% for CHWs-Mosquito, and 53% for CHWs-Salvador. These are not absolute values, applicable under all circumstances. The CHWs' volume of activity depends on their skill, their acceptance by the population, and, especially, their motivation. Although very uncertain, these figures give an indication of volume of work in a dispensary. At the beginning of an intervention, the number of consultations required to attend to the medical needs of 10,000 refugees will be 100-150 per day. This figure provides a basis for determining the number of medical staff and the quantity of drugs 41 necessary. # Hospital Care Similarly, it can be estimated that for a total population, 40-50 per 1,000 will need to be hospitalized. 42 Thus, for a population of 50,000 refugees, the relief team should reckon on 2,500 patients being hospitalized per year. If an average hospital stay is figured at seven days, this works out to 18,000 days of hospitalization. Accordingly, provision must be made for a hospitalization capacity of 50 beds."
