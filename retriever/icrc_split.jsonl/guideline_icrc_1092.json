"a fairly accurate idea of the population in the different villages, or the consultation is useless. One person is put in charge of placing the tokens, or beans, in the boxes traced on the ground or a large sheet of paper, where each box represents one village. The 100 tokens are distributed based upon the information provided by each participating elder and the comments of the others, until the entire group of participants agrees upon the resulting attribution -this then determines the allocation of the seeds to be distributed. One or several accessible villages are then visited in order to perform a head count and thus translate percentages into numbers. Figure 10.14 below illustrates this example of proportional piling. In this example, investigators then visit village A in order to perform a head count; if the latter produces a total of 501 persons, then 1 bean corresponds to approximately 42 persons (501 persons / 12 beans = 41.75 persons per bean).
