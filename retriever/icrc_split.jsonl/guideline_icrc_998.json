"organizations, and United Nations agencies are other major sources of information. Consultation clarifi es what has already been done, facilitates coordination or the attribution of tasks, and limits the duplication of efforts. Existing data also accounts for much of the assessment report baseline data. # Interviews Except in disaster, when facts speak loudly enough, interviews are the key method for attempting to understand a given situation. They promote dialogue and confi dence. Interviews may involve individuals or small groups (e.g. households), key informants (e.g. the local authorities, organizations, specialists or public servants), or larger groups that represent the community. The procedure consists fi rst of all of introducing and briefl y explaining the purpose of the assessment. Interlocutors must understand that the assessment aims to understand a situation, that there is no danger in providing the required information or, for that matter, in withholding it. They must also understand that assessment aims at detecting and documenting possible needs for assistance, and not at satisfying requests without further ado."
