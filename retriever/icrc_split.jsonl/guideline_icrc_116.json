"V. Supplementary Feeding # Definition The terminology used to define supplementary feeding is not standardized. For example, in the UNICEF manual Assisting in Emergencies, supplementary feeding is defined as: ''the need...to ensure that young and moderately malnourished children, pregnant and lactating women receive adequate and suitable food The best strategy for ensuring appropriate food for these 'vulnerable groups' must be decided locally in each case on the basis of a thorough assessment of the causes of their nutritional vulnerability and the practical possibilities for reducing that vulnerability.'' 64 More specifically, the procedure is described thus: ''Additional food is given to selected, nutritionally vulnerable individuals to compensate for specific deficiencies -in energy, protein, vitamins and mineralsin the food otherwise available to them. It is intended to be in addition to their normal share of household food, including any general emergency distributions.'' 65 The World Health Organization (WHO) manual The Management of Nutritional Emergencies in Large Populations defines the purpose of supplementary feeding as: ''to supplement deficiencies in energy and/or nutrients,"
