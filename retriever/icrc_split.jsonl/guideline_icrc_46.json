"by identifying the main events that have affected people's lives. The exercise can be done during a general group interview; the more diverse the group, the broader the perspective on local history. I Draw a line and pinpoint two or three important events that have occurred within living memory. Place them in chronological order on the line. I Explain that the objective is to fill in the gaps on this line with other past events. I Ask people to recall significant events of the past (both positive and negative) and when they happened in relation to the other events already identified. Encourage them to explain the causes of the events and their impact. # Proportional piling Proportional piling is a useful exercise for estimating quantities and proportions, especially when working with people who are not used to quantifying data.
