"exist for this level of identifi cation. 1. Socio-economic discrepancies internal to the community are such as to result in some of its members needing aid, and others not. 2. GFD could demotivate the community from fi nding its own solutions to the problem. 3. Available resources are insuffi cient to assist all households, even if they all more or less require support. # GFD implementation 3.3 Targeting groups Socio-economic discrepancies are documented in the course of assessment -it may be diffi cult to ascertain their mere existence, and the exercise must be thorough and unbiased. In the absence of socio-economic discrepancies, all community members are considered to need aid (or not), and the issue is resolved. If disparities have been detected on the other hand, means must be found to identify the households that do require assistance by use of appropriate indicators. The second question then arises: is this feasible? In relation to the risk of demotivating recipients, assessment should, here also, demonstrate the actual need for assistance."
