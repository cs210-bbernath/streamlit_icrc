"diversion of food aid intended for civilian populations by armed groups The sixth error derives from the first five: food aid is no trifling matter, and its mechanisms must be controlled. This can be done only by setting up an effective surveillance system which provides an overall view of the food system. The tendency has been to concentrate on the measurement of nutritional status as a surveillance tool; but this approach is much too restrictive to allow relief organizations to take steps to prevent malnutrition when access to food is interrupted. It also offers no opportunity to judge the impact of food aid on the local economic system. # Emergency Strategy Given such a diversity of problems, given the logistical, political, and other constraints, given all the factors that must be integrated into a strategy in order to avoid perverse effects, can an intervention strategy be proposed? Although any strategy must be adapted to the particular circumstances of the situation, certain broad principles may be applied to every emergency intervention."
