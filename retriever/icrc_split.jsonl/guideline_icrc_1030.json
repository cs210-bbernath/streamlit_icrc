"in comparing results with those obtained six months before, confi dence intervals must not overlap, and this may require smaller confi dence intervals. Moreover, a 5% confi dence interval around a 50% prevalence rate is perfectly acceptable, but would be meaningless for a 3% prevalence rate. The expected prevalence rate raises one of the two diffi culties of understanding of the sampling process (the second being that population size does not infl uence sample size, except for small populations). It seems odd to use a sampling method to determine the prevalence rate of a given variable, when that rate is required as a preliminary for calculating sample size. This involves a preliminary estimation of results, which is infl uenced by the knowledge of the fi eld and of existing problems, or the results of pilot studies. When a prevalence rate cannot be estimated with suffi cient accuracy, it is arbitrarily set at 50% -this rate gives the largest sample (for equal sampling error and confi dence intervals)"
