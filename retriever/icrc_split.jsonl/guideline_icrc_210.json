"assessing a site are: . access to water & Natural drainage This factor is important for the removal of liquid waste. In displaced-person camps during emergencies, the systems recommended for waste disposal do not require water. But a system for removing liquid waste (the products of domestic use and personal hygiene) must be set up.

This section will merely enumerate the general principles underlying emergency solutions to the most pressing problems. The main principle is to plan the camp on enough of a slope to permit waste water to drain naturally. This is plain common sense. More specific measures may be undertaken as well: . drainage around water-supply points drainage ditches along the roads . construction of a cesspool at the foot of the slope. & Ownership of the land Before setting up a camp, organizers must find out who the site belongs to and take all the necessary administrative steps with the proper authorities."
