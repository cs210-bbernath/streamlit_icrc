"the international media put pressure on the governments involved in mine manufacture to cease production completely. However, prevention efforts can also focus on the way mines are made, although this may sound bizarre at first. Yet these weapons could, in fact, be fitted with devices causing them to self-destruct automatically a certain length of time after they are put in the ground. Finally, with respect to the use of mines, the goal is to prohibit, or -more realistically -to limit their use, by means of precise rules. These three levels are linked. Prohibition of the use of mines goes together with intervention in mine production and trade. Intervention at these levels, however, is political. Health-care personnel working in the framework of humanitarian operations are not, of course, responsible for seeking political solutions to this problem. But it is clearly incumbent on them to point out, indeed, to denounce, the consequences of mine use to the political, military, and diplomatic authorities, and to sensitize the media to the problem."
