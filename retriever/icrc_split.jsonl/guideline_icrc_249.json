"The measures taken should be evaluated. Note should be taken, for example, of the number of children immunized in a day, and the number of vaccine doses used; similarly, the temperature charts used throughout the cold chain must be monitored. # Evaluation of Immunization Coverage Immunization coverage corresponds to the ratio between the number of subjects immunized and the number of subjects in the target group defined at the beginning of the immunization campaign. # Evaluation of Vaccination Effectiveness It is difficult to measure the rate of seroconversion in an emergency situation.
