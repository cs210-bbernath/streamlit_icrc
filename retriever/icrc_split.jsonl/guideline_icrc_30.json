"reason for abandoning the indispensable dimension of protection in an ICRC operational approach of whatever nature. Every delegation must be constantly aware of the need to include a protection component in its activities, so as to take maximum advantage of the potential of a situation and thus deal as effectively as possible with problems of protection. The first beneficiaries of ICRC protection are the Ministry of Health representatives who accompany us on MHU programmes in the field. Population groups who are vaccinated are protected from a whole range of diseases. Furthermore, during our missions in areas where the population is cut off from health services, we can collect allegations of abuse and may be able to make contact with armed groups. In this context of complementarity with protection activities, ICRC medical teams are sometimes asked to carry out health activities in remote areas where the population is exposed to violations of humanitarian law."
