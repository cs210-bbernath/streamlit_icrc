"Although political stability is essential to development, 11 what it represents must still be defined: a wide democratic consensus on general policies, or a dictatorship which imposes its own ''stability.'' 9 ''No sustained improvement in human well-being is possible without growth. But it is even more wrong to suggest that high economic growth rates will automatically translate into a higher level of human development. They may, or they may not. It all depends on the policy choices the countries make.'' Ibid., p. 14. At this point, pure economic and social reasoning must give way to the much larger realm of respect for human rights, and particularly for the right of peoples to choose their own form of political representation and socioeconomic development. Dictatorships, no matter what their orientation, do not lend themselves to a process of development, as witness numerous examples in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Africa. 12 & Is development a factor in political stability? Development which favors a minority to the detriment of the majority generates conflict."
