"difference between the values observed 38 for the two populations, and to estimate whether that difference is big enough to affirm that the populations are different (that is, to reject the null hypothesis). This must take account of the persistent risk of sampling errors; the error here would be rejecting the null hypothesis when it is in fact true. This risk is expressed as a probability, the p value. The difference between two populations is significant when the probability (p) of making a mistake is less than 5%, and highly significant when the probability is less than 1%. # Statistical Tests Relative Risk The measurement of relative risk is not, strictly speaking, a statistical test, since it involves merely simple calculations. However, since relative risk is directly linked to the value of the variable estimated from samples taken in two populations, it undergoes the same variations, based on the confidence level and the confidence limits."
