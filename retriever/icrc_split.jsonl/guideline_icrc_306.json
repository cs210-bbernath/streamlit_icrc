"is low. See WHO, Guidelines for Cholera Control. 89 Without treatment, 50% of subjects with positive sputum will die within two years. Oxfam, Guidelines for Tuberculosis Control. 90 A positive carrier may infect an average of 10 people (although not all will develop an active form of the disease). A second, more sophisticated approach is to calculate the annual risk of infection, 91 which represents the percent of newly infected subjects in the course of a year. This percentage is linked to the number of sources of infection (subjects with positive sputum) in the population concerned. This rate is estimated to be 1-6% 92 in developing countries. On this basis, the presumption is that each time the annual rate of infection increases by 1%, incidence increases by 50/100,000 per year. 93 Thus, for a rate of 3%, incidence will be 150/100,000, and prevalence 300/100,000; for a rate of 6%, incidence will be 300/100,000 and prevalence 600/ 100,000; and so on."
