"XIII; readers should refer to Sections 3.1, 3.1.1, 3.1.2 and 3.1.3, and use common sense to adapt the recommendations they contain. Therefore, only aspects specifi c to SFP centres are discussed here. In a centre restricted to the distribution of take-away rations, activities are limited to benefi ciary registration and discharge, monitoring their nutritional and health progress, and the distribution of food. Its structure is accordingly simpler. The SFP centre must be located as close as possible to the population it aims to support. Where rations are to be eaten on the spot, the centre must not be located further than a 30 minute walk away -2 hours in the case of take-away rations. This is not because relatives could travel no further, but to allow time for benefi ciary progress monitoring. The outline of an SFP centre structure NUTRITION MANUAL Chapter XIV -Supplementary 2.
