"magnesium, and copper defi ciencies can themselves cause diarrhoea . The above alterations have led Briend and Golden to recommend an adapted rehydration solution that differs from the standard WHO-recommended ORS solution (which aims at correcting diarrhoea in the absence of malnutrition). For the severely malnourished, ORS contains too much sodium and not enough potassium, and lacks minerals (Briend & Golden, 1993). ReSoMal is isotonic (291 mOsm); it is available commercially in a slightly modifi ed form (it contains no selenium 18 ). However, ReSoMal can also be made by diluting one sachet of the standard WHOrecommended ORS in 2 litres of drinking water (instead of the usual 1 litre), and adding 50 g of sugar (25 g/l) and 4 g of potassium chloride (KCI, 2 g/l) (MSF, 1995). The rehydration process must be slower in case of severe malnutrition than in the absence of malnutrition: between 70 and 100 ml of ReSoMal per kg of body weight is usually enough to restore normal hydration (WHO, 1999)."
