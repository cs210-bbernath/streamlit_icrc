Using the brakes on a car may illustrate this: braking aims at stopping the car (intended effect); the inevitable side effect is a heating of the brakes due to friction and, thus, energy loss. Braking too hard may cause the car to skid by locking the wheels (negative side effect). If the driver must brake abruptly, is the negative side effect of possible locked wheels preferable to the collision he is attempting to avoid? In the case of food distributions, the intended effect is to feed people; the side effect could be a drop in the market price of food, and the negative side effect a security incident perpetrated in protest.
