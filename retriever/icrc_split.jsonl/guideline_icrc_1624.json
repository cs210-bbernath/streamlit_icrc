"and if the TFC cannot include a camp for the permanent accommodation of carers. Therefore, feeding should begin as early as possible in the morning and end as late as possible at night. Experience has shown that 5 daily meals between 7:00 am and 5:00 pm yield good results, provided that they are regularly spaced (7:00 am, 9:30 am, 12:00 noon, 2:30 pm, and 5:00 pm) -however, the total number of daily meals should be no less than fi ve. It is usually not possible to distribute amounts that correspond to weight. The same amount must therefore be distributed to everyone, or benefi ciaries must be divided into two or three categories with set amounts for each category: 9 < 1 year with 300 ml/meal; 9 1-2 years with 400 ml/meal; 9 2 years with 500 ml/meal. During famines, the chosen solution has usually been the systematic distribution of 500 ml/meal to all children, permitting the supervised redistribution of remainders to those who were still hungry or their carers."
