"organism into account, including subclinical oedema, intestinal parasites, and fl uid retention resulting from infection and infl ammation. As a result, a weight-for-height index of -3 Z-scores in humid and hot conditions, with high levels of intestinal parasites and infectious disease will probably not mean the same degree of wasting as the same index in dry conditions in the absence of parasitoses. As mentioned earlier, substantial differences were noted between the Ethiopian highlands early in the rainy season and the desert fringes in arid conditions at the same moment. With the same weightfor-height index, the MUAC of highland children was much smaller than that of desert children. In other words, with the same MUAC-for-height, highland children were heavier than desert children, but they were nonetheless emaciated. Mid-upper arm circumference in fact refl ects the state of the tissue that serves as nutritional reserves, that is, lean mass and adipose tissue; MUAC variations thus indicate variations in these two tissues exclusively. As observed by Briend,"
