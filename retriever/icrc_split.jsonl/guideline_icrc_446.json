"to fall +d from the true mean. # & Value of the variable: The last concept involved in calculating sample size is the value of the variable sought. Since this value is unknown, it is estimated on the basis of previous data. If this cannot be done, for instance when the variable is a percentage, it is estimated at 50%. # Formulas for Calculating Sample Size A prerequisite 27 for calculating sample size is to determine: . the confidence level -generally 95%, which gives a value of z = 1.96. 28 the degree of precision sought -expressed as d, which is the product of z (x) SE. The smaller we want the standard error to be, the bigger the sample size must be. . the value of the percentage sought. The elements needed to calculate the size of a sample 29 are obtained as follows. 1. Size of a sample to estimate a mean in the framework of a random sample of an infinite population. n = z 2 (x)"
