"Cross or Red Crescent Society in any one country. It must be open to all. It must carry on its humanitarian work throughout its territory. # Universality The Red Cross is a worldwide institution in which all Societies have equal status and share equal responsibilities and duties in helping each other.\" The mottos of the Movement, Inter Arma Caritas (in war, charity) and Per Humanitatem ad Pacem (through humanity towards peace) express the sum of its ideals. Practical translations of the philosophy of humanitarian action as defi ned by the Fundamental Principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement may be found in the Code of Conduct 14 and the Sphere Project (1998). These documents encourage greater accountability on the part of humanitarian agencies towards the recipients of their assistance and donors, and invite better working relations. The Code of Conduct is limited to general principles, whereas the Sphere Project sets minimum standards in the main areas of humanitarian action. # Humanitarian ethics 3."
