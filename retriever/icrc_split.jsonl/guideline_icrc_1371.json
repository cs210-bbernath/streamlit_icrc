The decision should ultimately be based on medical expertise and adapt to circumstances rather than follow strict guidelines. As for the treatment of septic shock, broad-spectrum antibiotics and fi rst-line treatment must be administered, allowing for second-line treatment in case of failure to respond to fi rst-line therapy. In case of systematic treatment, distinctions must be made between marasmus, marasmus with complications and kwashiorkor. 1. marasmic children with no apparent sign of serious infection and no hypothermia or hypoglycaemia should receive fi rst-line treatment as follows: q Cotrimoxazole (25 mg of sulphamethoxazole + 5 mg of trimethoprim/kg), orally, twice daily for at least 5 days; 2. marasmic children with complications such as hypoglycaemia, hypothermia, septic shock, skin infections, respiratory or urinary tract infections, or lethargy; and 3."
