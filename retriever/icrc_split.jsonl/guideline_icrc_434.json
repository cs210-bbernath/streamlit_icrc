"a mean. It defines the median axis around which are gathered the set of individual values in the population studied. The median of a set of observations is the value located ''physically'' in the middle of the set. The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a set of observations. # Applications in Emergency Situations Emergency situations are no different from normal situations as regards choosing an index of central tendency. The arithmetic mean is the most commonly used measure. 17 # Distribution Curve If all the individual values for a given population are represented on a graph, the result is the classic or ''normal'' distribution curve (Gaussian curve), with the arithmetic mean as its center. The individual values will be distributed around the mean, spreading out more or less in relation to the latter. # Measures of Variability In a given population, each individual value will be a different distance from the mean. On the basis of this fact,"
