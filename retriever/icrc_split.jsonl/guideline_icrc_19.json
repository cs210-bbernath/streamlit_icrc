"needs for protection and assistance in the health zone concerned. # Health personnel are responsible for the ICRC's MHUs The possibility of providing high-quality service, the short-term and long-term implications, the costs, the coherence of the programme, and above all its time frame, are factors that only the person in charge of the health team can assess. The same person will be responsible for adapting the MHU strategy to changes in the political, health or security situation. The MHU strategy is therefore not a political decision but one taken on the basis of the health situation, and the main criterion for that decision is the quality of the services that can be provided. # MHUs are expensive to run Only very specialized services such as dentistry and ocular surgery have proved their efficiency. # MHUs are often a \"logistical nightmare\" MHUs by definition set out to reach population groups isolated because of poor security or difficulty of access."
