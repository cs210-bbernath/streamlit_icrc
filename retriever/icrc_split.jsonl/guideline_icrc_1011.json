"is statistically the most orthodox method in terms of random selection. Theoretically, this method requires the availability of lists (e.g. census data) of all numbered subjects (individuals or objects) of the population under consideration, and implies that they are all accessible. The number of subjects amounting to the size of the sample is then randomly chosen. This may be done by resorting to tables (an example is provided in Annex 19), mixing tickets up in a hat, rolling dice, or NUTRITION MANUAL Chapter X -Assessment and planning 3. General aspects I. Assessment of assessment methods 3.4 Selecting subjects mechanical sampling performed by a calculator (or computer spreadsheets) that generates random numbers. 16 Selected numbers are then all subjected to the survey itself. It is often impossible to conduct a comprehensive census, or to have access to the entire population, and the process can be quite costly and time-consuming. Systematic and cluster sampling methods reduce this type of constraint substantially. Another (less rigorous) random sampling method produces accurate results,"
