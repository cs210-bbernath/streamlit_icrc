"the international community in general to the difficulties humanitarian agencies face in the normal performance of their work. The danger of this strategy, as mentioned above, is that it can harden the attitudes of the authorities responsible for blocking access to the victims; this may affect other vulnerable groups who already benefit from the presence of humanitarian agencies. The strategy of discretion consists in betting on the success of bilateral negotiations with the authorities responsible for the violations of international humanitarian law to persuade them to change their attitude towards the victims. Humanitarian agencies must choose between these two strategies. The ICRC has opted for discretion, whereas other organizations, such as Amnesty International, have chosen public denunciation. The two approaches are complementary, but in general each organization adheres to the line it has adopted. # The Limits of Denunciation and Discretion The option of discretion has its limits. Accordingly, when negotiations lead nowhere and international humanitarian law is repeatedly violated, it is reasonable to change strategy."
