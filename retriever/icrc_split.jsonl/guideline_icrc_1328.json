"the use of spoon at the beginning of initial treatment, when carers or assistants feed children; this option improves control over the process and keeps it slow, which reduces the risk of vomiting. As children regain their appetite, the use of mugs is probably preferable, because it speeds the process up, and reduces spillage, which can be collected in a saucer. If children need help to drink, mothers or carers must be instructed how to assist them: the child must sit in the lap of its helper, whose arm cradles it comfortably, while the other arm is used to feed it. If the child is agitated and the helper cannot collect spillage, another helper must do so for the child to consume its entire ration. This aspect is essential during initial treatment, because intakes are deliberately calculated to be only just suffi cient to ensure maintenance. 3. Feeding must be resumed immediately, even in case of vomiting or diarrhoea."
