"(+) z 2 s 2 N For proportions: n = z 2 (x) pq = d 2 + z 2 pq N # Calculating the Size of a Sample to Find a Proportion by Simple Random Sampling Estimate of prevalence sought (when in doubt, take 50%, which will make the sample as large as possible) Cluster sampling is known to be less accurate than simple random sampling, but this disadvantage can be offset by increasing the size of the sample. Experience has shown that doubling the sample size necessary for simple random sampling is sufficient to compensate for the statistical approximativeness inherent in cluster sampling. 33 In the case given above, the size of the sample in cluster sampling would be 96 x 2 = 192. N = Z 2 pq D 2 q = 1 -p The minimum number of clusters must be 30. The size of the population from which the sample is drawn is in fact not very important, and it may not even be known."
