". Spring Water A spring is in fact ground water that rises to the surface at a certain point. The water has thus been naturally filtered by the geological strata and is usually potable. The trick is to draw the water immediately at the spot where it emerges (known as the ''eye'' of the spring). Spring water which has flowed above ground for too long becomes surface water, and is very likely to be polluted. Technological input is considerable. The filtration zone uphill from the point where the water emerges must be preserved and the filtration effect may have to be reinforced by the addition of new layers of sand or gravel. Uphill from the eye of the spring, a low retention wall is normally built, to which is adjoined a storage box. From it the water enters a distribution system (a simple pipe from which people help themselves directly to water, or a conduit to the village where distribution will take place). 19 ."
