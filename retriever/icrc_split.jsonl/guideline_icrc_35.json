"the modes of action (mobilization, support, substitution, etc.) to be applied. The strategy is a choice of activities and a combination of modes of action which make it possible to operate on different levels, while taking advantage of strong points and of the opportunities offered by the environment and trying to minimize weak points and to neutralize or circumvent external obstacles, in order to achieve the objectives set. MHUs are beset by a very large number of intrinsic constraints which must be considered at this stage. Here questions 4 and 5 must be combined so as to: -determine the diseases to be dealt with; -ensure that the priority activities correspond to those pathologies; -ensure that the question as to the modes of action to be applied is asked again for each activity. Do we have time to conduct our activities? Or should we abandon them? If we go ahead, will we achieve any results? Are we setting out to treat acute or chronic diseases?"
