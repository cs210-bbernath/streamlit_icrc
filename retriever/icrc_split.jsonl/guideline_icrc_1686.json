"tables (WHO, 1983) supplies MUAC-for-age and MUAC-for-height values with the standard deviation of MUAC-for-age. The -2 Z-scores threshold is more specifi c than 85% of the median values used by de Ville de Goyet; the -3 Z-scores threshold is roughly identical to 75% of these median values. The -2 Z-scores and -3 Z-scores thresholds tend to become more specifi c above 100 cm in height. This Manual recommends that the -2 Z-scores threshold be used for moderate malnutrition, and the -3 Z-scores threshold for severe malnutrition, as provided in Annex 4.3. Table A.9.2 below provides the data for the QUAC stick. # NUTRITION Feeding system of the observed population q Production: q contribution of the agricultural and pastoral production to the overall economy in normal conditions and at the time of the assessment; q access to land and production inputs (seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation, veterinary services, animal feed); q crop and herd types; q seasonal calendar; q cultivated surface, herd size, and possible yield;"
