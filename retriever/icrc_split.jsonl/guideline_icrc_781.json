"severe humid or wet beriberi at any moment (Davidson et al., 1979). It is still unclear why it develops into one form rather than the other. Davidson suggests that active people tend to develop wet beriberi, owing to the high concentration of pyruvate produced by the expenditure of energy; more sedentary people tend to develop nervous disorders (peripheral neuropathy and, less frequently, encephalopathy associated with the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, particularly among alcoholics) (Davidson et al., 1979). # Wet beriberi Also called cardiac beriberi, wet beriberi implies progressive cardio-vascular disorder, associated with excess pyruvate and lactic acid in the bloodstream (thiamine defi ciency impedes the transformation of pyruvate into acetyl coenzyme A). The accumulation of these metabolites appears to cause the dilatation of peripheral blood vessels, resulting in vasodilatation. At this stage, fl uid is leaking from capillary vessels, resulting in the formation of oedemas. Vasodilatation also causes an increase of the cardiac function in order to maintain blood circulation. The cardiac muscle, already weakened by the defi ciency in thiamine,"
