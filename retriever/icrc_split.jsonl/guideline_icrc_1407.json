They were initially intended to promote the nutritional recovery of moderately and slightly malnourished children, as well as preventing a deterioration of the nutritional status in specifi c circumstances: poverty, weaning, or an unfavourable environment, conducive to infectious diseasewhose possible impact on the nutritional status has been discussed above. 5 Results vary greatly for a number of reasons; they have been discussed at length in a famous study by Beaton & Ghassemi (Beaton & Ghassemi, 1982) and summarized by Gillespie & Mason (Gillespie & Mason, 1991). One reason, which could not be considered at the time, was the fact that rations were rich in protein and energy, but could not always compensate defi ciencies in Type II nutrients. 6 In that case nutritional recovery is quite slow, or even impossible, and cannot be confi rmed by anthropometry if the indicator is weight for age.
