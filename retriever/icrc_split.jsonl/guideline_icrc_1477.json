"proper cleaning and sterilizing is virtually impossible to guarantee. It is therefore best to use spoons, even if this option initially requires patience and time. The use of bottles and teats is strongly advised against here, because children can be spoon-fed from day one, provided that they are gently and patiently coaxed into the method. The use of bottles also suggests that such utensils are necessary, and this can provide a bad example. Any leftovers must be disposed of or fed to somebody else -they must never be kept for the following meal. Leftovers can become a dangerous culture medium within tens of minutes depending on the climate and environmental contamination. Artifi cially-fed infants must be able to drink water when they are thirsty -this is usually the case in hot climates and in the case of diarrhoea or fever. Sickness should not cause the child to receive less food or fl uids. # Medical care Children that are not breastfed run greater risks of developing infections."
