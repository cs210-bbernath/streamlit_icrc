"If resources permit, the entire population can be immunized; otherwise, immunization must be reserved for the groups most at risk. Alternatively, vaccination can be provided only for people coming directly in contact with the disease, to reduce the number of secondary cases. To be effective, an immunization campaign must be carried out rapidly (at least before the peak of the epidemic, which occurs sometime during the first four weeks). A surveillance system is therefore fundamental, since it permits immediate detection of an epidemic. The determining threshold for an epidemic may be: . a cumulative incidence higher than 100/100,000; . a doubling of cases from one week to the next; . a rate of attack higher than 15 cases per week for two weeks. The procedure for organizing an immunization campaign need not be reviewed here, since the problems are similar for every disease. # Cases Presenting a Biological Reaction It is unrealistic to try to treat subjects showing meningococcus in a throat culture."
