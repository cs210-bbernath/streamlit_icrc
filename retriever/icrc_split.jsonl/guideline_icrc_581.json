"which the road network, means of communication (telephone), etc., are so important. # International Economic Vulnerability Economic vulnerability follows the Dow Jones index. An international economic recession does not have much effect on the volume of international aid sent to countries in the grip of disaster. However, if there is no acute emergency, programs to prepare for or prevent disasters (dams for flood control, for example) are cut to the bone. As a result, all the groundwork done to reduce certain types of local and national vulnerability will be disrupted. The international economy, by controlling the prices of raw materials and foodstuffs, directly influences the income of a large proportion of the rural populations of developing countries (cf. the collapse of cocoa prices). The examples are many. The role of humanitarian agencies working in emergency situations is usually limited to identifying family and local economic vulnerability, with no involvement in the resolution of national and international problems."
