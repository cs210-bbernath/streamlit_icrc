"energy requirements are 2,895 kcal (12,100 kJ); the reference adult female weighs 55 kg, and her average daily energy requirements are 2,210 kcal (9,240 kJ) (Latham, 1997). Applying this level of requirements to WHO 2 adults raises the average daily ration to 2,243 kcal (9,375 kJ). # NUTRITION MANUAL Chapter XII -General food distribution 3. GFD implementation # Setting rations On the basis of the information above, the question arises as to which of the following recommendations should be chosen. 9 WHO, the WFP and UNHCR have recently chosen to round the WHO 2 ration up to 2,100 kcal (8,780 kJ) as the reference ration for initial planning. This ration is somewhat restrictive, as it rests upon a rather low adult weight and only light physical activity. In camp settings, the population is indeed often rather inactive; in most situations, however, populations targeted for GFD assistance are moderately, or even heavily, active. In this respect, it is worth reiterating that they may depend on general distributions,"
