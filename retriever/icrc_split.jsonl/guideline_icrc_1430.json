"have fallen, but new cases continue to appear owing to new arrivals and/or persistently harsh living conditions (incapacity to deliver adequate healthcare, poor climatic conditions, precarious habitat and general survival). In the second situation, a GFD is uncalled for, but economic living conditions can be precarious, and/or problems can arise in the fi eld of health services, water and habitat, in turn promoting the appearance of scattered malnutrition cases. This scenario again illustrates the comments made in Section 2.1.1.A above on admission and discharge criteria and food distribution methods. Benefi ciary selection can be made at the entry point to the centre, as soon as the population has been informed of the latter's existence and objective. The active search for individual cases on the basis of household visits is particularly recommended in such circumstances. # Providing a relay for therapeutic feeding When therapeutic feeding centres (TFC) are overstretched, it may be preferable to complete the nutritional treatment in an SFP centre, linked to the TFC."
