"the gums, bleeding of the gums following contact, and diffi cult healing. After 180 to 200 days, internal haemorrhaging intensifi es, old scars reopen, gums become spongy, teeth loosen, osteoporosis appears, pain is considerable, and the patient becomes immobile.\" (Basu & Dickerson, 1996). The above timeframe warrants caution. The development of scurvy is determined by two variables: reserves existing at the onset of defi ciency, and the magnitude of the dietary defi ciency itself. Moreover, dietary vitamin C concentrations may vary according to circumstances. What matters here is that a population whose diet contains virtually no vitamin C and who already faces subclinical defi ciency is exposed to epidemic-scale scurvy within 2 to 3 months, and mortality will appear within 3 to 4. Furthermore, death can occur without warning at any time after the appearance of the classic clinical signs of defi ciency (internal bleeding and gum damage). Declared scurvy is thus a very serious illness,"
