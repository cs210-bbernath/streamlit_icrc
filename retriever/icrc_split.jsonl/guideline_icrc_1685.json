"to be overly sensitive, whereas the 75% cut-off point is neither too sensitive nor too specifi c in order to determine severe wasting. 1 The US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) reference tables for mid-upper arm circumference (WHO, 1995;Mei, 1997) provide median MUAC-for-age and MUAC-for-height values with their standard deviation. Unfortunately, the standard deviation is low in MUAC-forheight tables (Mei, 1997), causing the -2 Z-scores and especially the -3 Z-scores thresholds to be too sensitive to determine moderate, and especially severe, malnutrition accurately. For example, for a child measuring 92 cm, the -2 Z-scores threshold is 13.9 cm, the -3 Z-scores threshold is 12.8 cm. The corresponding values for 85% and 75% of the median are 13.9 and 12.2 respectively according to de Ville de Goyet. Sensitivity grows with height, causing an increasing specifi city loss. On the other hand, the combination of MUAC-for-age tables (WHO, 1995) and height-for-age tables (WHO, 1983) supplies MUAC-for-age and MUAC-for-height values with the standard deviation of MUAC-for-age."
