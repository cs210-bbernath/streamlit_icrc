"in regions of unstable or low transmission, immunity fluctuates, and there may be a large increase in the number of malaria cases during periods of high transmission. # -age In regions of unstable transmission, all the members of the population are predisposed to attacks of malaria. In regions of stable transmission, certain age groups are more vulnerable than others. Essentially, children under the age of two years are most at risk. 47 -pregnancy Mortality among pregnant women, especially primapara, is particularly high. 48 Whether or not a certain immunity is present within the population is a key determinant for the development of ''malaria disease.''
