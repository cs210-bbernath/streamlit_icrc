"fact that F-75 and F-100 Formulae contain all the necessary vitamins and minerals in appropriate amounts. # Congestive heart failure Heart failure can result from over-hydration when standard ORS solution is given, or from severe anaemia. It is indicated mainly by fast breathing (40 breaths per minute or more in children between 2 and 12 months, and 30 breaths per minute in children between 1 and 5 years). Feeding and fl uid intake must be stopped immediately until breathing slows down substantially -this can take between half a day and two days. # Kwashiorkor dermatosis This is characterized by pigment loss (hypo-pigmentation) of the skin, shedding of the skin in fl akes or scales, and skin ulceration. Provided that feeding follows the protocols indicated above, dermatosis recedes and heals quickly (within 2 to 3 days), mainly because of the zinc contained in the diet. Because kwashiorkor cases must in any case be subjected to antibiotic treatment upon admission, the risk of infection is controlled."
