By assessing the degree of imbalance between the subject's initial resistance and the magnitude of the pathogenic attack, we can anticipate the seriousness of the clinical manifestations, and take the necessary measures in time. The migration of a non-immune population to a region where the malarial agent Plasmodium falciparum is endemic should prompt fears of a considerable increase in cases of severe malaria. A clinical case of disease may give rise to permanent damage (paralysis after poliomyelitis, for example, or keratomalacia after measles). Here again, consideration of both the immediate clinical aspects and the potential sequelae will help determine the measures to be taken. A disease does not necessarily go through all the stages mentioned. Many infections go unnoticed.
