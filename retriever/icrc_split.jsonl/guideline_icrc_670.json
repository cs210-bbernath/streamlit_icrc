"are below the standards that would be considered normal in a particular context. Humanitarian agencies give themselves the ''right'' to take over the facilities in question in order to improve their performance, reorganizing their management, investing in them, etc. In this case, the question of the facility's autonomy or dependence vis-a`-vis the authorities normally responsible arises. Without real control over the facility's operation, relief organizations cannot expect rapid change; the aid they provide will go to produce services which will always be below the norm. At the other end of the spectrum, however, a total appropriation of the facility amounts to a strategy of dependence. In short, humanitarian agencies must respect what already exists, but, at the same time, they must know how to take its place if necessary. Any attempt of this sort should, of course, be subject to careful reflection. Besides the colonialist overtones of this approach, its long-term effects must be considered -for example, the risk that the local authorities will abdicate their responsibility."
