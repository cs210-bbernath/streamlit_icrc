"and apply this percentage to the observed values of the number of cases. The values obtained are those that would appear if there were no differences in the number of cases in the different populations. The same procedure is carried out for the subjects who do not present the characteristic. The values obtained are those that would be obtained for the ''non-cases'' if there were no differences between the population groups. 40 Thus, the test calculates the differences between the observed values and the values that ought to have been obtained if there were no difference. It expresses the result in the form of a numerical value. The magnitude of this value depends on the degree of difference between the values mentioned above. Empirically, the greater the chi-squared value, the greater the probability that the populations are different. If, for example, the chi-squared value is 3.841, the probability of error is 5%, and the two populations are affirmed to be different. The chi-squared value reaches 6."
