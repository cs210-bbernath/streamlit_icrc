Without a broader strategy encompassing the maintenance of family food security, however, rehabilitated children will find themselves back in a dysfunctional food system where families' basic needs are not covered. Such children will inevitably slip back into their previous malnourished condition, with its attendant risk of death. 47 The second common error is not to plan for a long-term solution based on selfsufficiency for a population that has already benefited from assistance.
