"and an undue acceleration of the overall rehydration rate. In the course of rehydration, patients must also resume feeding as quickly as possible, that is, as soon as they become alert. Breastfeeding is the best approach, and the child should be encouraged to feed every 20 to 30 minutes from the onset of rehydration. It is worth reiterating here that breastfeeding is an absolute priority in the treatment of severe malnutrition, in all circumstances. Furthermore, F-75 Formula should be given as soon as possible (usually 2 to 3 hours after starting rehydration). As soon as the rehydration frequency diminishes with larger amounts of ReSoMal and feeding resumes, ReSoMal is alternated with F-75 Formula. There is no risk of excess mineral concentrations if ReSoMal is alternated with F-75 Formula, especially in the case of potassium; both solutions in fact share roughly the same mineral concentration, which corresponds to requirements. However, ReSoMal must never be combined with F-75 Formula in the same solution,"
