"a given height) and statural growth (the height achieved for a given age). It also facilitates the understanding of nutritional compartments, such as lean mass and adipose tissue, for example through the measurement of mid-upper arm circumference and skin folds. Nutritional anthropometry is a non-invasive method that is cheap and relatively easy to handle; it relates to both individuals and entire populations. It enables the understanding of the nutritional status of the former on a quantitative basis, and to monitor it during treatment, for example. In populations, it reveals the overall nutritional status based on, for example, the prevalence rate of weight defi cit. It also permits the monitoring of this status in the course of surveillance or the evaluation of programmes intended to improve it. This rate is measured through what is called anthropometric survey, either of a representative sample, or of the entire frame population. The measurement of the nutritional status of a given population provides reasonably accurate data regarding its nutritional condition."
