"5% accuracy, and the expected prevalence rate was 20%. Assuming that actual values are in fact as follows: p = the actual prevalence rate = 35% n = the actual sample size = 220. Then actual accuracy is the following: accuracy = \u00b1 1.96 \u00d7 1/2 = \u00b1 6.3% The fi nal result is thus 35 \u00b1 6.3%, the actual accuracy being \u00b1 6.3% and not \u00b1 5% as suggested by the initially chosen accuracy. In cluster random sampling, the formula used to obtain actual accuracy is not determined by sample size, but by the differences in results from different clusters. The resulting formula is the following: accuracy = \u00b1 \u03b5 \u00d7 {\u03a3 i = 1 to k (p i -p) 2 / } 1/2 Where: p = the actual overall prevalence rate in the entire sample, say 30.1% k = the total number of clusters included in the sample, say 5 i = a given cluster within the overall sample (numbered 1 to k)"
