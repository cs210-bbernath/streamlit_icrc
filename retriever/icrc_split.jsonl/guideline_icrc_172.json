"developing countries, there are many local methods for drawing water from wells -for example, by means of a bucket attached to a rope and either thrown directly into the well or set on the end of a counterweighted pole. The major disadvantage of these systems is that the well usually remains uncovered. 21 # Choosing between Different Methods and Means of Digging a Well # Handdigging Use of mechanical digging tools # Boring with a drill # Mechanical drilling # Means # Manual Mechanical Digging # Methods # Drilling # Pumps The use of pumps has the advantage of allowing the well to remain closed, and if measures for protecting the area around the well are correctly applied, the water is kept free of all contamination. There are many types of pumps, which can be broadly classified as manual pumps or mechanical pumps. The technical specifications of each pump will not be described here;"
