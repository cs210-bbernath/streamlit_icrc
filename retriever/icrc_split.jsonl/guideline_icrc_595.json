"than circumstances. # IV. Applications This section will cover drought, earthquakes, floods, and volcanic eruptions. # Droughts Droughts are an ideal example for a study of vulnerability, as they are numerous and involve a complex interaction of factors. # Interaction of Phenomenon and Vulnerability # Vertical Chain of Reaction Changes in rainfall, whether a decrease compared to the usual level or a anarchical distribution of rainfall over the year, may result in a lack of usable water for agriculture, due to preexisting erosion 41 and the absence of any reservoir system. The final result is an ecological disaster. This disaster, in turn, will endanger those crops sensitive to lack of water, reducing agricultural production 42 and thereby giving rise to an agricultural disaster. The drop in agricultural yield will affect the economically vulnerable groups, 43 who will have trouble obtaining food. These problems will be all the more serious if the society in which they occur has a vulnerable social structure (dysfunction of traditional mechanisms of mutual aid,"
