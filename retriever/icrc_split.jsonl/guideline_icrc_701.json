"by virtue of its specific mandate, it sets three conditions before undertaking any relief action, namely that it be allowed access to the persons requiring assistance, to observe their situation and to evaluate their needs; that it be present when the aid is brought in; and, finally, that it be allowed to exercise administrative supervision in order to prepare reports on distributions made.'' 10 If the authorities will not give advance consent to the monitoring of humanitarian assistance, the humanitarian agencies can either withhold assistance until they receive a guarantee that they will be able to supervise it, or provide the aid in the hope that the authorities will eventually yield. The crucial point here is how urgent the victims' needs are. If the situation is critical, postponing humanitarian assistance is ethically questionable. If conditions are less drastic, it is then possible to temporize while trying to obtain permission to supervise the operation. In the time required to conduct such negotiations, however, the victims' condition may deteriorate dramatically,"
