"high on governments' priority lists; they prefer to focus resources on programs that have an immediate impact, rather than on EWSs, the utility of which is less obvious. # Political difficulties Political leaders are loath to admit that a crisis is near, and tend to downplay its extent. Only in a serious nutritional crisis will they admit the truth. # The unwieldy nature of interventions Relief interventions are generally logistically ponderous, and decision-makers prefer to wait for solid evidence 77 before putting them into motion. Under such circumstances, EWSs have a limited value, unless their predictive value is improved in future and decision-makers' mentalities change. Epidemiology is an important component of relief actions. Epidemiological tools are necessary in all fields: nutrition, environmental hygiene, communicable diseases, curative medicine. Moreover, their integration in the framework of epidemiological programs permits a global approach to crisis situations (initial assessment) as well as providing the opportunity to monitor crisis evolution (epidemiological surveillance). 77 Today's mentality considers ''evidence'' to be a high mortality rate."
