"lessons learned from the unfortunate experience of the disaster. For example, following an earthquake, structures may be rebuilt in accordance with anti-seismic norms. These may be considered as true development activities, designed to make populations less vulnerable to harmful phenomena in future. # Intervention Strategy in the Wake of a Disaster Aid to victims is an essential task, and one that local resources are best suited to perform. International relief must be considered as back-up support for local mutual-aid systems. Rehabilitating the facilities damaged by the disaster must be part of the emergency strategy. In the short run, it is more efficient and less expensive to repair a water-supply system than to settle for distributing water from tanker trucks. The two measures can obviously be combined. Similarly, agricultural rehabilitation programs are essential to take over from food distribution programs. Reconstruction cannot be undertaken without preliminary identification of the areas of vulnerability that gave way under the shock of the initial phenomenon."
