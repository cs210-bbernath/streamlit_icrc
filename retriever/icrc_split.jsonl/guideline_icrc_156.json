"toxic substances (arsenic, mercury, lead, nitrates, etc.) or abnormally high levels of trace elements (such as fluoride) in the water poses a risk to the health of the people who consume it. Eliminating such substances requires complex, costly technical measures which are difficult to implement under normal circumstances, and practically impossible during an emergency. An elevated concentration of salts (chlorides, sulfates) leads to few health problems, since beyond a certain level the water's salty taste deters people from drinking it. 8 Where chemical contamination presents a danger to health, the only solution is to seek another water-supply source. # Physical Quality Physical quality concerns the physical attributes of the water, namely taste, smell, and appearance. Water which appears turbid is not necessarily unfit for consumption, if microbiological and chemical criteria are met; but the potential consumers may be disinclined to drink ''dirty'' water.
