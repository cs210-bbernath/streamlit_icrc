"off, preventive measures must be taken from the outset, such as the distribution of vitamin A capsules to all children under the age of 10. 19 The advantage of vitamin A relates to the fact that it is stored in the liver in rather large amounts. The posology is 200,000 IU (110 mg of retinol palmitate or 66 mg of retinol acetate) per dose, administered orally, for all ages above 1 year; half that amount, that is, 100,000 IU (55 mg of retinol palmitate or 33 mg of retinol acetate) per dose, administered orally, is recommended for infants between 0 and 12 months. Preventive treatment should be avoided during pregnancy, and instead a single 200,000 IU dose should be administered straight after delivery. Vitamin A capsules are usually found in 100,000 IU and 200,000 IU doses. If no 100,000 IU capsules are available for small infants, a 200,000 IU capsule may be punctured, and three drops extracted from it for oral administration."
