"food, population. Boxes are then drawn up, each corresponding to an object in relation to which the variable must be examined. Informants are then requested to place a number of tokens, such as beans or stones, in each box proportionately to each object. The total number of tokens must be 100 (to refl ect 100%). For example, a survey is conducted prior to the distribution of seeds in an area that includes many remote or inaccessible villages. The population (i.e. the variable) of each village (in this case, the object) must be defi ned for the appropriate allocation of seeds. The community elders (that is, the informants who are assumed to hold most legitimacy within the community) are invited and informed of the purpose and conduct of the survey; they are then requested to defi ne the population in each village. The elders must know one another well, and have a fairly accurate idea of the population in the different villages, or the consultation is useless."
