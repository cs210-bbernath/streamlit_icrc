Locating edible mushrooms involves some knowledge as to toxicity, and of where, when and how they may be found. This cannot be done effectively by a beginner referring continuously to a textbook, because academic research and fi eld investigation are not simultaneous activities. As a result, a certain minimum knowledge or the presence of an expert is required, or the excursion is fruitless and may even be dangerous. The same comments apply to nutritional surveys: comprehensive nutritional expertise is not necessary, but investigators must know where to fi nd information in case of doubt, and must bear some basic conceptual models in mind. Economic performance models, 20 household economy models, 21 and the feeding system model 22 are especially helpful in this respect."
