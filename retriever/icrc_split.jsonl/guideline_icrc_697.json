"The use of resources from outside the country is often necessary. In every case, the consequences of deciding to use outside resources must be carefully weighed. For example, the food resources required for a relief operation may be purchased in the trouble zone itself; or in the country, but outside the trouble zone; or in neighboring countries; or, finally, they may be imported from Europe, the US, or other surplus countries. Merely ascertaining whether food is available locally is not sufficient; a whole group of factors must be analyzed. # Buying locally Buying locally offers several advantages: costs are lower (food, transport, maintenance, etc.), the food is more quickly available (short transport time, no customs duty), and it is better suited to local dietary habits. All these factors make local purchasing very attractive. However, it should be remembered that local buying may unbalance a shaky local market, and that local merchants will refuse to sell their food stocks in order to push prices up."
