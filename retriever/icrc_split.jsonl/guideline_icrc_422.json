"cases of malaria and is therefore highly sensitive, but a number of cases thereby labeled as ''malaria'' are not actually malaria, meaning that this indicator has a weak positive predictive value. If fever (temperature higher than 37.5 o C) is taken as an indicator, the tendency will be towards a reduction of the proportion of negative cases labeled as positive by the first indicator (better specificity). At the same time, however, sensitivity will decline, in that a large proportion of genuine malaria cases will be labeled as not having the disease. A test's positive predictive value varies according to the proportion of the selected indicator in the population. If the proportion of cases in the population is weak, 9 S.K. Lwanga and Cho-Yook Tye, Teaching Health Statistics (Geneva: WHO, 1986), p. 16. 10 The results of such a test can be accepted as fairly conclusive, although the fact that no parasites are detected in a microscopic examination does not formally rule out malarial infection."
