"assessment 2.1 Preliminary appraisal At the time of assessment, the economic adjustment response aimed at increasing the use of the most profi table means of production in order to compensate the production loss caused by the drought, is as follows: 9 20% of the required resources are generated by agriculture; 9 20% by gathering; 9 30% by wage-labour; 9 10% by social obligations; 9 20% by reserves set aside for this use. In the above example, the population under consideration is still at the adaptation level of the famine process -in other words, its food-securing performance is still satisfactory. A qualitative gap appears, but it is not yet quantitative. The hypothesis that drought causes problems is not confi rmed in this fi rst stage of the feeding process. It may however be verifi ed with respect to the consumption and biological utilization of food because, at these stages, adaptation may translate into changes in the time devoted to the different essential activities, and in the functioning of the family cell."
