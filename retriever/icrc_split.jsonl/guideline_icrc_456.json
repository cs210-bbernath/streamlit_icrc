"= 1.96). In this case, the two populations will be deemed similar, as long as the difference between the values of the control population and those of the studied population remains within the confidence interval. However, if the value for the surveyed population exceeds these limits, the two populations must be considered different with respect to the variable under examination. Yet this difference cannot be accepted as certain, since, in the example above, there is still a 5% probability that the populations are similareven if the value of the population studied is outside the confidence interval, since this interval was defined with a confidence level of 95% (z = 1.96). The opposite situation involves two populations presenting different true means (for example, 8% and 17%). Due to sampling errors, the value obtained for the sample from the first population may be 12% (mean + z SE), while the value for the sample from the second population is 13% (mean -SE). The two values are dangerously close,"
