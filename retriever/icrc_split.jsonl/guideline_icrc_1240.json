"targeting must not be attempted, and aid may need to be cancelled altogether. Nevertheless, the humanitarian agency running a GFD must retain control over targeting processes, precisely in order to avoid diversion and limit pressure on local authorities. It goes without saying that results are infl uenced above all by the quality of human relations and mutual trust, and this does not just arise from decisions or goodwill but from sustained interaction, which is often utopian in times of crisis. In addition to targeting, the second challenge lies in the defi nition of selection criteria that are practical and unambiguous. This may generate a technical problem whose magnitude grows with diminishing vulnerability levels and rising numbers of individuals in the critical bracket. The local population and its leaders should participate in the identifi cation of those who require assistance as a priority. But the seriousness of the situation and its potential for deterioration may complicate participation to the point of causing more problems than it resolves."
