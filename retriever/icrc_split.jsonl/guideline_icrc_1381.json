"important in view of the fact that nutritional catch-up is calorie and energyintensive, requiring 5 kcal (21 kJ) and 0.16 g of protein per gram of recovered tissue. Rapid catch-up (in the order of 20 g/kg/day) implies that the proportion of food that it requires is equal to or greater than maintenance requirements. For example, the maintenance requirement of a child weighing 10 kg is 1,000 kcal (4,180 kJ) per day. Based on a daily catch-up rate of 20 g/kg/day, this child will gain 200 g per day, which require 1,000 kcal (4,180 kJ) in addition to maintenance needs. Adequate and regular intake is therefore essential as soon as nutritional catch-up has begun -practically speaking, children under 5 years of age need an average intake of 200 kcal (840 kJ)/kg/day, provided that physical activity is moderate, and that thermo-genesis requirements are low. 34 If physical activity is heavy, the intake should be 250 kcal (1,050 kJ)/kg/day. With respect to protein,"
