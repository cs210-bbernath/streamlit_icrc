"particular, sea fi sh and seafood) from iodine-rich areas are no longer at risk. # The development of defi ciency and symptoms The most striking clinical manifestations of iodine defi ciency is goitre, which is a hypertrophy (or abnormal enlargement) of the thyroid gland. This hypertrophy in fact refl ects an adaptation of the organ to an insuffi cient iodine intake, enabling it to drain more blood and, thus, improve the capture of circulating iodine, which is necessary for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. A daily iodine intake that is lower than 50 \u03bcg is considered to be insuffi cient in adults. The thyroid is located at the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. According to the severity of defi ciency, the goitre may cause a slight, unobtrusive or large (larger than 1 litre) and highly visible swelling. It may be soft or nodular; the latter indicates long-term defi ciency."
