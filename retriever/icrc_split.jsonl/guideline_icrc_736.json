"History The organization Me\u00b4decins sans Frontie`res (''Doctors without Borders'') was founded in 1971 in Paris. Today it has seven sections (France, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Spain, and Greece). # Structure Each section is directed by a president and a director-general. The International Council, which meets every three months, comprises the seven presidents and the seven directors-general, as well as the secretary-general of MSF International. The board defines the main policy lines of the organization. # Role MSF acts in all emergency situations, whether they are caused by natural disasters or armed conflicts. Its sphere of action is essentially health. Assistance to refugees is a major part of its programs. MSF actions are based on a charter which defines the context and structure of its interventions. Under the charter, MSF volunteers undertake neutral, impartial action in the name of universal medical ethics and the right to assistance. MSF also implements long-term rehabilitation programs, particularly for hospitals. 7. The European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) # History The European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO)"
