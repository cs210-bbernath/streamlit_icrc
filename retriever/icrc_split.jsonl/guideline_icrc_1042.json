"fi rst be considered as severely wasted. The adjusted distribution is then 33% severe wasting, 42% moderate wasting, and 25% acceptable nutritional status. The 200 missing subjects are then classifi ed as \"acceptable\", and the adjusted distribution becomes 16% severe wasting, 42% moderate wasting, and 42% acceptable nutritional status. Both distributions are possible, and the situation must be investigated in order to determine whether it results from the absence of subjects (absenteeism). Corroboration of the feeding process and/ or renewed measurements should then establish whether the result is closer to 33% or 16% of severe malnutrition, which is, after all, a substantial difference. Whether the objective is to obtain a rough idea of severe malnutrition rates or to compare such rates with previous or future rates, the sampling error is too signifi cant for results to be simply accepted as fi nal. This example shows that complete enumeration may indeed be faster than sampling, but may also involve serious delays if its results are questionable."
