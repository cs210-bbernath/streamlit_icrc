"a population (migration) and the economy (market prices), are relatively simple and reliable. # Seriousness Drought is very serious for a population. Of course, a drought does not appear to kill as many people as the immediate effects of an earthquake, since it is a slowly developing phenomenon which does not have the suddenness of an earthquake. The death rates per 10,000 people affected by an earthquake or a drought are, respectively, 150 and 8. 75 Nonetheless, of all the disasters, drought is in first place due to the size of the populations affected 76 and the mortality associated with it (the number of deaths is often underestimated). # EWSs in Drought-Prone Areas The Choice of Indicators The choice of indicators depends on the probable causes of drought. Although these indicators are interwoven in a complex manner, a certain hierarchy among them can be established, based not on their power to precipitate the problem, but on their capacity to reflect the seriousness of the situation."
