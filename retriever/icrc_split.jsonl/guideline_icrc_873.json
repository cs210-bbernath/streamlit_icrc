"In other words, problems at these levels are unlikely to be relevant to humanitarian action: if the society has survived so far, then these parameters are probably normally adequate. On the other hand, the stress caused by crisis is a different matter, whether it aggravates deleterious practices, or induces new ones. Dangerous behaviour and its causes must therefore be detected, and addressed if possible. This is preferable to attempting to resolve disorders in the previous category without addressing their causes. Deleterious behaviour has three main causes that should be properly distinguished in crisis: Constraints can only be removed in order to remedy their effects on consumption. Practices and maladjustment, on the other hand, can only be tackled through sensitization and education. However, natural intelligence and curiosity tend to be eclipsed by the need to survive in times of crisis.
