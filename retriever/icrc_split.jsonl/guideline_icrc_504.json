"identify the source of the epidemic - establish criteria for diagnosing cases - monitor the progress of the epidemic point they would begin to take steps to protect themselves against the rising waters. # Basic Principles Theoretically, all disasters could be predicted by EWSs, which would report preliminary signs of conflict -social instability, disturbances between ethnic groups, political conflicts, etc. -and early signs of natural disasters, such as the results of seismological, volcanic, and hydrological surveillance. However, trials of EWSs have been confined mostly to drought prediction, for the following reasons. # Ease of Prediction Droughts are easy to predict compared with disasters that develop extremely quickly, such as earthquakes and cyclones. There are two reasons for this. First, droughts develop slowly, allowing time (theoretically) to take preventive measures in case of alert. Second, the indicators that permit observers to predict a drought, or at least its initial consequences for a population (migration) and the economy (market prices), are relatively simple and reliable."
