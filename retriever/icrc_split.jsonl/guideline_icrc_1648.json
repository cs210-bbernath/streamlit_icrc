"excessively theoretical. 9 Key messages should be kept clear and simple, they should be repeated regularly, and be tested as often as possible. The three guiding principles of teaching are: what is only heard is forgotten, what is seen is more likely to be recalled, but only what has been practised is remembered. 9 Each session should be limited to the delivery of one key message only. 9 Each session should conclude with its evaluation. 9 Key messages should be identical for all. 9 Regular sessions should be organized for the audience to share its experiences and suggest improvements or changes -endorsement by the audience is the only guarantee of success. 9 Training staff should follow trainees closely until the delivered instructions are spontaneously applied in practice. 9 Programme indicators should refl ect expected behavioural change clearly; in crisis, indicators should relate to the reduction of the incidence and seriousness of sickness, rather than to growth performance and nutritional status, which cannot improve dramatically in highly precarious living conditions."
