"idea of the growth of pre-school children. # Indicator of change This implies the longitudinal study (i.e. over time) of individuals or groups. Weight, MUAC and height may also be used independently, without reference to age or height. course of the monitoring, the method used initially must be applied throughout; if necessary, it may be combined with another measurement. # Indicator of reference point It may be best to set reference points, especially in preliminary appraisal. Indicator selection is determined by: 9 the purpose of the measurement: growth and/or tissue mass; 9 available resources; 9 available time; 9 the sampling method; 9 existing data where available. MUAC, alone or related to height, is more suitable than weight measurements. # Screening indicator MUAC-for-height provides the most accurate indication of wasting, but MUAC alone is quite acceptable, and is faster. Depending on the purpose of screening and available resources, thresholds may be set that differ from conventional cut-off points."
