"children are exposed to. # Intestinal infections Intestinal infections usually manifest themselves through diarrhoea, which can be bacterial, parasitic, or viral. The difference is not easily made in a TFC, especially in the absence of laboratory facilities. Viral diarrhoea has no specifi c treatment, and accounts for 60% of all cases according to MSF (MSF, 1992). Consequently, most diarrhoea cases require no other treatment than the replacement of lost fl uids, done with ReSoMal. If diarrhoea is combined with fever, the treatment for septic shock should be applied immediately. Bloody stool suggests the presence of shigellosis: this is treated for 5 days with cotrimoxazole (according to the prescription for simple marasmus provided above). If bloody diarrhoea persists for more than 2 days, the antibiotic must be replaced with one that is effective on the local shigellosis strain (WHO, 1999). If diarrhoea (bloody or not, with or without fever) persists beyond 5 days of treatment, metronidazole should be introduced (see below, parasite infections)."
