"on a daily basis, regular weight verifi cation is indispensable to follow individual benefi ciary progress, so that appropriate measures may be taken. # SUPERVISION AND ASSESSMENT Supervising the activities of the centre facilitates the overall assessment of its performance and of developments in the circumstances, while assessment allows the verifi cation that set objectives are being met. # Supervision In terms of supervision, comments are the same as those found in Chapter XIII, Section 3.4.1, except for meal attendance. In an SFP centre, a higher than 90% meal attendance is considered satisfactory. A lower rate usually indicates problems external to the centre rather than doubts about the quality of the services it provides. Understanding the reasons for lower than expected attendance rates is therefore necessary for appropriate steps to be taken. (Gillespie & Mason, 1991) This statement shows the limits of nutritional information outside crises, and highlights the precautions that should be taken before engaging in such programmes."
