"ratio between the number of individuals that hold the opinion and the overall population, multiplied by one hundred (this is frequently done in election polls, for instance): number of cases at a given moment prevalence rate = - ---------------------------------\u00d7 # overall number of individuals at risk Prevalence rates refl ect the magnitude of an event at a given moment in time. They must be accompanied by some comment as to its causes, and predictions as to its most probable evolution, in order to be used correctly in terms of action. # Mortality The mortality rate is the number of deaths during a specifi ed period of time as a proportion of the overall population, measured at the middle of that period, expressed in per 1,000, per 10,000, or per 100,000. Mortality rates are commonly calculated for age or sex groups, or in relation to the causes of a specifi c situation. Cause-specifi c mortality rates are useful to determine the severity of a problem, provided that valid comparison points exist."
