"direct contact with carers or close relatives. Hypothermia (rectal temperature lower than 35.5\u00b0C) requires patients to be kept warm: 9 maternal contact is best: the mother lies on her back and her child is placed on her chest, in direct contact with her skin and covered with clothes (including its head) and blankets; 9 if this is not possible, the child must be wrapped in blankets and an incandescent fi lament lamp must be placed above it but at a safe distance and rectal temperature must be checked every half-hour, as hyperthermia can set in quickly. If the child is unable to maintain a normal temperature independently within two days, death is almost inevitable (Perrin, 1985). Because of the direct association between hypoglycaemia, hypothermia, and infection, any patient suffering from hypothermia should be treated for hypoglycaemia and systemic infection also, and be fed. # Dehydration and electrolyte and mineral imbalance Dehydration is a very serious complication of severe malnutrition. As such, it must be detected and treated rapidly."
