The European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) # History The European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) was created in 1992 in order to increase the effectiveness and visibility of the European Union's humanitarian efforts. In addition, the European Commission wanted to concentrate its various emergency-relief instruments within a single organization. # Mandate ECHO reflects the desire of the European Union to provide more rapid and effective assistance to the victims of conflicts taking place in third countries. # Role ECHO intervenes primarily by obtaining funding for the activities of its operational partners (international and non-governmental organizations, the ICRC). ECHO also implements its own operations as a subsidiary activity. # A New Organization: the Geneva Foundation # History The Geneva Foundation was established in 1994 in Geneva. It was born of the perceived need to rationalize the humanitarian response, given the disproportion between the needs of war victims and the resources made available to the organizations working to help them."
