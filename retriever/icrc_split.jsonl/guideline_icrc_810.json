"disease common. Breastfeeding pregnant women reveal prevalence rates that are considerably higher than those of other female community members. Prevalence studies have shown that boys are more prone to the defi ciency than girls are (1.2 to 10 times more). Patients, especially young children, suffering from infectious disease can show an insuffi cient vitamin A transport (related to systemic infection), signifi cantly increased faecal excretion (diarrhoea), strongly diminished absorption (intestinal parasites), and an increased urinary excretion combined with a reduced absorption (respiratory infection). Other vulnerable groups include prisoners (whose diet is usually insuffi cient and largely or entirely lacking fresh foods), and refugees and the displaced who do not have access to complete rations. # The development of defi ciency and symptoms Thanks to the storage of vitamin A in the liver, reserves enable survival for many months. However, where the disorder is endemic, precipitating factors such as measles or kwashiorkor (their combined effects are devastating in this respect) can reveal clinical signs within days."
