"financial means once the emergency is over; 8 . lack of personnel to meet both urgent demands and long-term demands. Despite these obstacles, however, every emergency aid program must include some reference to a long-term solution -even if it consists in nothing more than delegating the responsibility to specialized agencies. The solutions commonly proposed are not truly long-term solutions, since they usually consist in rehabilitation programs designed to restore facilities to their former state. This is not genuine development, since no radical changes are made in the techniques used or in individual behavior, nor are the established systems challenged. For a rural population with no food resources, the priority is, of course, food distribution. However, from the moment preparation begins for a food aid operation, thought should be given to alternative measures that will eventually replace the food distributions. One possibility might be, for example, providing the population with seeds and tools so that they can return to their usual agricultural activities and achieve a certain self-sufficiency."
