"of subjects. If the purpose of the survey is to obtain some estimate, even a rough one, of mortality, morbidity, or malnutrition rates, the epidemiologist should take these distortions into account when analyzing the data. # Sample Size A sample should be as large as possible to reduce sampling errors to the minimum; it should be as small as possible to reduce the investment of operational resources to the minimum. In deciding on the right size for a sample, investigators must respect certain basic principles. & The concept of sampling error: Where the entire population is surveyed and the mean is calculated, the result obtained is the true value of the mean (Xp). If, instead, sampling is employed and the mean (Xe) is calculated from the data collected from the sample, the value obtained will deviate more or less from the true mean. If the sampling process is repeated, each time with the same number of subjects, each time a mean (Xe 1 , Xe 2 , Xe 3 ,"
