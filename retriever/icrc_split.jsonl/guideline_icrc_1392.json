If the potential number of benefi ciaries is high (and provided that access to food at home is adequate), rehabilitation may also be terminated as soon as the patients' nutritional status exceeds the criteria for severe malnutrition and their medical disorders are treated; such patients are then transferred to Supplementary Feeding Programme (SFP) centres. 39 This option however increases the risk of relapse, and slows down the catch-up process. # ADDITIONAL ASPECTS OF INITIAL TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION # Breastfeeding Breastfeeding is an absolute priority in the treatment of severe malnutrition, and every effort must be made to encourage or restore it. 40 The importance of breastfeeding is even greater in a TFC because maternal milk is the best possible infant food: it protects against infection (which is often rampant in a TFC), and plays a fundamental role in the emotional balance of infants, which is usually upset by their living conditions and malnutrition."
