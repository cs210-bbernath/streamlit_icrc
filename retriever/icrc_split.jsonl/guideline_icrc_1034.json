"in stratifi ed sampling, is calculated in the same way as for simple random sampling. # General aspects of assessment methods 3.4 Selecting subjects Cluster random sampling Sample size is calculated in the same way as simple random sampling, but the greater uncertainty, and the inevitable heterogeneity associated with clusters must be allowed for. The formula is therefore completed with a \"c\" cluster factor, which increases sample size in order to preserve the degree of accuracy. Experience shows that a factor of 2 (c = 2) is usually suffi cient: doubling the sample size obtained through the simple sampling formula adequately allows for the cluster effect. The adapted formula is as follows: p \u00d7 q n = \u03b5 2 \u00d7 c \u00d7 ------- d 2 Where the cluster factor c = 2. In the case of cluster sampling intended to determine the experimental value of a prevalence rate expected to be of 20%, the sample size is the following: The number of clusters must then be determined: for example,"
