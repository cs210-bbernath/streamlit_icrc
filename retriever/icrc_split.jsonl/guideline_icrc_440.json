"EPI coverage. In this application, it was calculated that 30 clusters were necessary, and that, in each cluster, it was sufficient to examine 7 children. 22 The geographical location of the clusters is determined on the basis of the sampling interval 23 and the cumulative list of the population present in each geographical location or area. A sampling frame must be constructed for each of these methods. The sampling frame may consist in a list of all subjects (simple random sampling, systematic sampling), a list of all subjects by strata (stratified sampling), or a list of all the clusters (cluster sampling). 23 The sampling interval is calculated by dividing the total population by the number of clusters provided for in the sample. The choice between the different sampling methods will depend on various considerations: -geographical distribution of the population -In a displaced-person camp where an entire, homogeneous population is concentrated in a restricted space, simple random sampling is adequate. If the population comprises subgroups with different characteristics (for example,"
