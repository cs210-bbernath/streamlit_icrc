"several Type II nutrients (unlike F-75 Formula) whose interaction is essential in tissue synthesis. Annex 15 provides their composition and use. The formula containing ReSoMal supplies approximately 74 kcal (313 kJ) for 100 ml, with a P/E% of 6.6%. Pre-mix is prepared by blending the powdered milk, sugar, and ReSoMal powder, and then mixing in the oil until the blend is completely homogeneous. If pre-mix is not used immediately, it must be mixed again before use because oil tends to separate out. Milk is reconstituted with water that has been previously boiled for at least 10 minutes. # Formula without ReSoMal In the absence of both vitamin and mineral complements and ReSoMal, a formula similar to F-75 may nevertheless be prepared; it however lacks the amounts of vitamins and minerals that are necessary for the optimal treatment of severe malnutrition. The amount of sugar is increased to compensate for the absence of ReSoMal. This formula has nevertheless proven effi cient in initial treatment, and is presented in Table 13.7 below."
