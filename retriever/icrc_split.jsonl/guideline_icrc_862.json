"that humanitarian aid is confi ned to specifi c operations such as food assistance or healthcare is now obsolete. Accordingly, Perrin's essay adopts a global and multidisciplinary approach: humanitarian and development aid are both linked to social problems, and must ensure that society can live adequately in compliance with its cultural standards (Perrin, 1996). # Cost Free donations are less common today; concepts such as cost recovery and compensation funds -or micro-credit -are steadily gaining ground, not to mention \"food-for-work\" projects that are questionable in many circumstances. In fact, when services default (and not the population's resources), free donations are probably not the most appropriate. The challenge lies in setting contribution levels that do not exclude the poorest: this may be achieved through differentiated tariffs, or the waiving of payment for the most destitute. But such solutions are not easy to implement, and may even prove unrealistic, owing to the diffi culty of targeting and setting thresholds between recipient categories."
