"constant attention. The preparation, distribution and consumption of food are most time-consuming; as such, they should be organized to perfection and be supervised constantly in order to ensure their quality and regularity. # Food distribution The benefi ciaries, their carers, and the staff must all know and observe mealtime schedules. During initial treatment, assistants can deliver the food directly to the patients in the intensive care unit, especially if the latter operates 24 hours per day. Otherwise, the benefi ciaries and carers collect the food. They are asked to queue in an orderly way; their presence is recorded at each meal. They then wash their hands and proceed to the canteen; at its entrance, they receive their ration in a bowl, mug, or plate, with a spoon. They are asked to sit in rows in order to allow supervisors to check that the meal takes place as planned, and to assist children or helpless people if necessary."
