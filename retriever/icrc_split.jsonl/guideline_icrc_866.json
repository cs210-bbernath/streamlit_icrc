"the implicit admission is that each expression refers to a type of intervention. In fact, from a semantic perspective, the words development and rehabilitation are compatible, but the term emergency is incompatible with the other two. Development and rehabilitation express action, whereas emergency simply indicates a state of affairs. Semantic rectitude would suggest the use of \"survival relief \": this expression avoids confusion, and can easily be associated with rehabilitation and development. \"Emergency\" would then preserve its fi rst meaning according to the circumstances of a given operation: the urgency of enforcing fundamental rights, of providing economic support to vulnerable groups to avert famine, of evacuating casualties to save lives, of restoring economic self-suffi ciency, of engaging in development to mitigate structural weaknesses... Distinguishing emergency from humanitarian action provides a more serene image of humanitarian aid, and invites more accountability towards the victims,"
