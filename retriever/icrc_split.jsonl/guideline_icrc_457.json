"the sample from the second population is 13% (mean -SE). The two values are dangerously close, to the point where they are equated with each other. In this case, the affirmation that the two populations are identical is an ''error of the second kind,'' or type II error. The risk of error can be reduced by increasing the value of z. Thus, if z = 2.58, the risk of the value falling outside the confidence interval would be 1%. In the preceding example, the limits of that interval would be 10% and 20% (+2.58 SE). This means that the value of the variable in the population studied must be more than 20% or less than 10% for the two populations to be declared different (with a 1% probability that the difference will be due to a sampling error). While the probability of type I errors is reduced by pushing back further and further the points at which the two populations are declared different,"
