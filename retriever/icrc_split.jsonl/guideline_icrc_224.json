"interaction of risk factors. A clear plan of action should be adopted, based on the natural cycle of communicable disease; that cycle will determine the different levels of intervention. In February, 1985, in the refugee camps in eastern Sudan, mortality rates for measles, diarrheal illnesses, and respiratory infections were 16/1000/month, 8/1000/month, and 2/1000/month, respectively. See M. Toole and R. Waldman, ''An Analysis of Mortality Trends among Refugee Populations in Somalia, Sudan and Thailand,'' Bulletin of the World Health Organization 66 (1986). # Natural Disease Cycle as Applied to Communicable Diseases The classic model of the natural history of a disease comprises several stages: What provides the link between a population's susceptibility and an attack by pathogens? We have already seen that a population's susceptibility to a pathogen is not uniform, and varies from one pathogen to the next. The measles virus, for example, constitutes a problem for only a specific sector of the population. But the interaction between susceptibility and pathogenic agents is not always this simple."
