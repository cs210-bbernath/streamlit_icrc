"family size. Set numbers of family members along demographic lines would seem a useful device for operating agencies, as it permits the preparation and distribution of standard rations. It is however not recommended, because it profi ts families that are smaller than average, to the detriment of larger families, without an automatic reallocation of the distributed resources to correct this imbalance. Grouping families according to set numbers of individuals is time-consuming for recipients. If they can agree however, this option can be quite useful and fast (like set family sizes on a demographic basis). Nevertheless, experience shows that individual distribution is usually best. Queues and handover points are organized according to the actual number of family members. As a result, each family receives its exact entitlement. Handover point staff is familiar with individual amounts, and this option saves time and confusion. Individual distribution is also surprisingly fast: it can permit the distribution of goods to as many as 25,000 persons per day in a single location."
