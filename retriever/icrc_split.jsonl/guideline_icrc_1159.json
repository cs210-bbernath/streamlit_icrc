"The rate of supply must also match the rate of distribution, allow for the most appropriate reserves, and follow the \"fi rst in/fi rst out\" principle. The greater the reserves, the more variable the commodity fl ow can be, and the lower the risk of shortages is; however in that case, storage conditions also require more attention, in order to prevent the deterioration of the commodities. On the other hand, the smaller the reserves, the more constrained the commodity fl ow is because of the greater risk of shortage; however, spoilage related to storage is of course less likely. Large, immobile stocks are expensive, and generate signifi cant risks in terms of commodity expiry, lack of use and theft. Humanitarian agencies must accept these dangers: limiting stocks reduces risks and costs for the operating agency, but exposes victims to the risk of shortage. Humanitarian action deals with uncertainty, and the best possible compromise must therefore be found -this is usually based on experience."
