"mainly by recommended intakes. However, energy may equally be supplied in the form of lipids or glucides (simple or complex, see below) as in the form of protein. In order to limit statistical health risks, 14 the necessary balance between macronutrients in order to satisfy energy requirements are summarized below. # The contribution of lipids to the overall energy intake Lipids should account for 15 to 30% of the overall energy intake (WHO, 2003). # The contribution of saturated and unsaturated lipid to the overall energy intake The proportion of lipids within the overall energy supply (i.e. 30%) should combine 20% unsaturated lipids -of which 2.5% essential lipids -and no more than 10% saturated lipids (WHO, 2003;European Commission, 1993). # The contribution of protein to the overall energy intake The energy value of protein is 4 kcal (16.7 kJ)/g. Protein should account for 12 to 13% of the overall energy intake (WHO, 1988b). In actual fact,"
