"Use of Existing Surgical Services? In every situation involving war-wounded, the question arises whether to work with an autonomous surgical unit or to use existing surgical services. Making the right decision involves considering a whole set of parameters, such as the number of wounded, security, access to health-care services, and the quality of care. The procedure to follow is discussed in Chapter 7 (''The Health-Care System''). # Level of Care The level of care is conventionally defined in terms of a country's socioeconomic level. The facilities offered by the US army in Viet Nam, for example, have nothing in common with those of Angola, Ethiopia, etc. The maximalist approach depends basically on the capacity to mobilize considerable resources in the form of personnel, logistic equipment (helicopters for evacuation, etc.), and so on. Only Western-type armies can afford this luxury. The minimalist approach relies on the strict management of existing resources to achieve an optimal outcome with respect not only to survival, but also to functional recovery."
