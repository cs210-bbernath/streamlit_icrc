"-this increases the protein concentration, raising the P/E% to approximately 6.5%. # ReSoMal adjunction In the absence of vitamin and mineral complements, ReSoMal may be used to produce a formula that is similar to F-75 (see Table 13.6 below); this alternative however lacks vitamins, which can be supplied in the form of tablets. On the other hand, in the absence of declared vitamin defi ciency, minerals (especially zinc) are more important at this stage. The protein-energy ratio (P/E%) is the percentage of the protein contribution to the overall energy of the diet. As a reminder, 1 g of protein supplies 4 kcal. Consequently, the protein-energy ratio, expressed in %, is obtained by multiplying the number of grams of protein in the ration by 4, dividing the result by the overall energy content of the ration, and multiplying the fi nal result by 100. Results are adequate, but such recipes lack several Type II nutrients (unlike F-75 Formula) whose interaction is essential in tissue synthesis."
