Diphtheria, for example, is a serious disease, but relatively rare, with limited contagiousness. Measles, on the other hand, is also a serious illness, more common than diphtheria, and highly contagious. It thus represents a definite risk for vulnerable groups. Intestinal parasites, in turn, may be a public health problem for a large proportion of a population; yet, except in rare instances, they are not life-threatening.

For example, epidemic meningitis develops during the dry season; the incidence of malaria, diarrheal diseases,"
