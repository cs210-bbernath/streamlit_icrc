"accurate height measurement, which saves time, human resources, and calculations. # Conventional cut-off points and classifi cation: 1. CDC classifi cation: 9 > 85%: normal nutritional status 9 85 to 80%: moderate malnutrition 9 < 80%: severe malnutrition. # Waterlow classifi cation: 9 > 90% or > -1 Z-score: satisfactory nutritional status 9 89 to 80% or < -1 Z-score to -2 Z-scores: mild malnutrition 9 79 to 70% or < -2 Z-scores to -3 Z-scores: moderate malnutrition 9 < 70% or < -3 Z-scores: severe malnutrition. The above matrix shows that groups located in the white areas do not require urgent action, whereas those that are located in the shaded boxes do, and the further towards the upper left-hand corner they are, the greater their need for assistance. The matrix validity must then be tested by fi eld surveys, and its contents adjusted as required. For example, farmers located along the river may turn out to be less vulnerable to drought than initially assumed, if their land is irrigated."
