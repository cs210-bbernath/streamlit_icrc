"to water, or a conduit to the village where distribution will take place). 19 . Ground Water Ground water is the water least immediately available. Consequently, the technological input necessary to gain access to it will be greater than for other sources. However, ground water has a naturally good microbiological quality that surface water, for example, does not. Surface water is easily accessible, but it must be treated before it can be consumed, whereas treatment is usually not necessary for ground water. In practice, the initial technological investment may seem large, but it later turns out to be in fact relatively minor. Thus, when potential water sources are being compared, the issue of technological input should be seen in perspective. # Principal Steps for Using a Natural Spring as a Source of Water Supply - identify the eye of the spring (the point where the water emerges) - develop a filtration system (natural or engineered)"
