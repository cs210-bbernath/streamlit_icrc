"GFD implementation 3.5 Distribution modalities of six distribution points, of which each serves two recipient groups on a fortnightly distribution basis, implies that each round be conducted in less than a fortnight, and that each group receive its rations every fortnight. If one group is served per day, then the round would be completed in 12 days; this is too long for a fortnightly cycle, because it leaves no leeway for unexpected delays. If on the other hand two groups are served every day, then the round would be completed in 6 days (for example, 4 days during the fi rst week and 2 days during the following week). This would allow for delays, the drafting of reports, monitoring, the organization of the following round, the maintenance of vehicles, materials, and warehouses and, if necessary, would even permit the postponing of a given distribution. Rest for staff is necessary also, because assistance work is stressful. Proper work plans are a crucial element of a smooth logistical operation."
