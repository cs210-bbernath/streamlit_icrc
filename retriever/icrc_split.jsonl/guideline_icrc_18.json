"made for primary and secondary level hospitals to receive patients sent to them by the ICRC, which pays the transport costs (no ambulance service). -In Sri Lanka, patients who were seriously ill were transferred to three hospitals in the Vanni region. # MHUs are not tools for assessing a health zone Any assessment generates considerable expectations among the potential beneficiaries. To avoid disappointing the population groups concerned (this might cause security problems), it is important not to confuse assessment with strategy for action. MHUs are a strategy for responding to a health problem, and not an evaluation tool. An MHU is not set up to assess the needs of a population group, \"to see who will turn up, and with what sort of problem\".
