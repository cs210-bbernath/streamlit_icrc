"1. To monitor the evolution of factors (phenomena, vulnerabilities, impacts, and problems) that prompted humanitarian action in the fi rst place. 2. To follow the evolution of the feeding process (activity implementation and performance). 3. To derive the evolution of the needs for assistance from the previous two points. 4. To predict the probable evolution of the nutritional situation and of the need for aid, in order to plan the rest of the operation. 5. To monitor the practical implementation of aid programmes by verifying that the resources are utilized as initially planned. This may be illustrated by the following example. On the Angolan Planalto, in a rural environment, minimal monitoring consists in verifying the availability of production inputs and the access to land prior to the two planting seasons in July and October. It then involves supervising plant growth and appraising the harvest potential, according to the climatic conditions and the action of non-human predators."
