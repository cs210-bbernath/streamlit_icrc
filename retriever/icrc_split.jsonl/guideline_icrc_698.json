"merchants will refuse to sell their food stocks in order to push prices up. # Buying in neighboring countries The risks involved in buying supplies in the bordering regions or countries are the same as for buying locally, though they are less certain and less extensive. # Importing from Western countries Importing food from Western countries presents major disadvantages in terms of delivery time and cost (even if it is not the aid agency that foots the bill, in the case of donated goods and transport). Moreover, there is a risk of importing food inappropriate to local conditions. Just as the introduction of new medical intervention strategies (such as for tuberculosis) is risky, so the introduction of new technologies or products may have harmful consequences. Here again, this does not mean that anything new should automatically be rejected; but a distinction must be made between what is appropriate and what is not. The introduction of inappropriate resources (too expensive, or unsuited to needs) is contrary to humanitarian ethics."
