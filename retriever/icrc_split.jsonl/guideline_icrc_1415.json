"are indeed those in which SFPs have the greatest impact, are most justifi ed, and entail the least negative side effects. Where SFPs aim at temporarily containing the effects of a crisis, the moderate malnutrition criterion should also reveal restricted access to food, unless available means permit the implementation of a preventive SFP. This is uncommon; if it were the case, the criterion would be restricted access to food. 1. General comments 1.7 The risk of negative side effects # THE RISK OF NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS Where SFPs aim at temporarily containing the effects of an acute or developing crisis -owing to the fact that preventive measures are inadequate -the risk of negative side effects is greatest. All the more so because some humanitarian agencies view SFPs as an almost standard response to inadequate basic rations, which translate into more or less serious malnutrition. Thus the rationale for SFPs in crisis is usually observed malnutrition rates and insuffi cient access to food for the majority of victims."
