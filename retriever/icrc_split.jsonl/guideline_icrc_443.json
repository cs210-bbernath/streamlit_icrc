"time with the same number of subjects, each time a mean (Xe 1 , Xe 2 , Xe 3 , etc.) will be obtained that deviates + from the true mean (Xp). If all the values Xe 1 , Xe 2 , Xe 3 , and so forth are values representing individuals and arranged in a distribution pattern, the latter will have three main properties: 24 1. The mean (XE) obtained from the means of a series of identical samples is equal to the true mean (calculated on the basis of the entire population). 2. The standard deviation between the mean XE and the mean of each sample (Xe 1 , Xe 2 , etc.) is called the standard error. 25 3. The distribution curve of the means Xe 1 , Xe 2 , etc., is a normal distribution curve."
