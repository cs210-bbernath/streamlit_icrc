"these groups de facto lack access to a balanced diet); 9 groups suffering from sub-clinical defi ciency abruptly expected to make an unusually heavy physical effort (thiamine requirements increase with energy spending). # The development of defi ciency and symptoms Thiamine defi ciency is frequently associated with defi ciencies in other B group vitamins, and severe malnutrition. As a result, early clinical signs are not always easy to interpret unambiguously as indicators of thiamine defi ciency. The onset of defi ciency may be identifi ed through a reduced thiamine excretion in the urine. After approximately 10 days, the transketolase activity of the erythrocytes becomes depressed; after 3 to 4 weeks, fatigue, irritability, headaches, emotional instability and depression appear (Basu et al., 1996;Shils et al., 1994). If defi ciency persists, beriberi as such appears. Just as for scurvy, this timeframe refl ects the development of defi ciency beginning from a normal situation. The clinical signs typical of beriberi can appear within 1 to 2 months."
