"target groups that are especially vulnerable or, where this is not possible, to set ration levels that satisfy the need for assistance as effectively as possible. This however implies that some will receive too much, and others too little; the latter may require additional safety measures such as the establishment of supplementary and therapeutic feeding centres in order to treat moderate and severe malnutrition. 9 Coping mechanisms and the economic potential of available resources can be diffi cult to appraise, and may be unclear if target groups are still at the stage of exploring available opportunities. 9 Over time, GFD benefi ciaries usually improve their economic effi ciency and their nutritional status, and this may justify ration adjustments. However, fi eld workers must not follow impressions blindly, and they must remember that GFD rations sometimes provide a nutritional and an economic contribution simultaneously. Food access possibilities alone must therefore not infl uence ration adjustments; the economic situation of ration recipients must be appraised in the light of overall operational objectives."
