"priority will depend largely, from one situation to another, on : the possibilities for implementation: local and expatriate human resources, logistical resources and, in the case of MHUs, the time to be spent on the spot, for example ; how the population perceives the situation. Example of the prioritization process for a given situation : 1. In the case of vaccinations, when an epidemic breaks out social mobilization will take place very spontaneously as soon as information about the time and place of the vaccination campaign begins to circulate. When there is no epidemic, however, mobilization may take much more time and require more resources. 2. IEC (information, education, communication) sessions are rarely a priority in an emergency situation, but are an essential activity at all other times. In the case of MHUs, the selection of priorities among activities is essential in view of the intermittent nature of the services provided. Careful thought must be given to any new activity."
