Rather than a poor nutritional status, the risk of deterioration should be the criterion for action. Nutritional status is in this case an indicator among others in the decision-making process. In assessment, it serves to test hypotheses, to monitor developments, to measure the impact of operations or the severity of a situation and, for example, to select individuals for inclusion in therapeutic feeding programmes. Consequently, anthropometric survey is not necessarily a priority in preliminary appraisal. # Anthropometric variables and their measurement The commonest anthropometric variables are age, weight, height, and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC, or brachial circumference). This section also discusses the detection of oedema, which is not an anthropometric variable, but is usually investigated together with nutritional anthropometry. # Age The age of small children is a necessary parameter in evaluating statural growth and, to a certain extent, ponderal growth."
