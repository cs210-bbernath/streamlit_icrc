"Dehydration is a very serious complication of severe malnutrition. As such, it must be detected and treated rapidly. Dehydration occurs in the following stages (Gentilini, 1986): The clinical signs that should suggest incipient or developed septic shock are (WHO, 1999): 9 signs of dehydration, but without a history of watery diarrhoea; 9 hypothermia or hypoglycaemia; 9 oedema and signs of dehydration. It is worth noting that the combination of several infections can often associate dehydration, due to past diarrhoea episodes, with septic shock. Septic shock is mainly treated by administering broad-spectrum antibiotics as soon as its is diagnosed. The recommended fi rst-line treatment is the following (WHO, 1999): 9 Ampicillin: 50 mg/kg every 6 hours for 2 days, followed by amoxicillin, 15 mg/kg every 8 hours for 5 days (if amoxicillin is unavailable, ampicillin can be given -25 mg/kg every 6 hours). In combination with: 9 Gentamicin: 7.5 mg/kg once daily for 7 days. The second-line treatment follows if the patient fails to respond, if improvement is weak,"
