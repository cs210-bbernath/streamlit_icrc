Treatment outlines are provided in Chapter XIII. # Management of the centre These features are the same for supplementary feeding programme (SFP) and therapeutic feeding centres (TFC). They have been discussed in Chapter XIII, Section 3.3.8. # Other activities SFP centres delivering rations to be eaten on the spot offer the opportunity for other activities than meal distribution, healthcare and recovery monitoring -which must, nevertheless, remain the centre's central tasks.
