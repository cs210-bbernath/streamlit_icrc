"human resources and logistical constraints. # What will be done ? To decide what should be done, planners must take note of existing norms and the constraints of the situation. This will allow them to define the limits of what can realistically be attempted -in other words, to set objectives. The decision to take action takes an analysis of the political and health situation (pre-crisis, acute crisis, chronic crisis or transition) into account. Mortality and morbidity rates have been ascertained by the assessment and are our first priority. # How will it be done ? To achieve a particular objective, planners can choose between several types of activities. Initially, they must define all the activities that can be undertaken to accomplish a specific objective, and then decide which will actually be carried out and in what order -in short, determine a strategy. At delegation level, it is essential to determine the modes of action (mobilization, support, substitution, etc.) to be applied."
