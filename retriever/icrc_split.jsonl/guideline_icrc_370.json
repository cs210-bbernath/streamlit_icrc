"# Evaluation of Health-Care Facilities An evaluation of the activities carried out in a health-care facility is doubly useful. Before an intervention, it shows whether an existing facility has what it needs to cope with an emergency situation. In the course of an intervention, the evaluation process can be applied to a facility set up especially for the occasion; in this case, it falls into the more general framework of a surveillance program. # Designing a Consultation Room Should there be provision for patients to lie down during examinations, and if so, how much space is required? Where should the cupboard containing medical equipment be placed? Where should the washstand be? How much space is needed to write prescriptions and explain them to patients? Are a table and three chairs needed? Most ''check lists'' for dispensaries or hospitals contain basically quantitative information; this chapter, however, will also discuss the qualitative aspect of health-facility structures."
