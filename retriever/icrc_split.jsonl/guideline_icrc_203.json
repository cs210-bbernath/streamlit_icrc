"of means of protection from the cold favors the development of malnutrition and increases mortality linked to hypothermia, which itself is fostered by malnutrition. Indirectly, then, ''warming up'' displaced populations by providing them with housing suited to the climate and, if necessary, sources of energy (wood, kerosene) as well makes it possible to reduce the quantity of food required for distribution. 53 The distribution of blankets is more economical than the distribution of a food supplement to cover energy needs generated by chill. Unsuitable housing, such as, for example, the crowding of large numbers of people into collective habitations, causes an increase in certain communicable diseases, as well as psychological stress. An increase in maladies such as tuberculosis, measles, or scabies is directly linked to overcrowding. In addition, the absence of family privacy is a factor in psychological and social tension. Access to energy sources is always a problem for displaced populations. First of all, most major population movements occur in disadvantaged countries, where energy supplies are traditionally unreliable."
