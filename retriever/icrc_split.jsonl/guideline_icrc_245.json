"work is necessary before an immunization program can be implemented. Usually this work will be carried out through the medium of the most representative members of the community. -The proximity of health services to the population In displaced-person or refugee camps, distances are not generally a problem. At the beginning of the campaign, mobile teams move from one place to another in the camp, following an itinerary jointly decided on with the representatives of the population. The campaign may be carried out either by mobile teams or through outpatient visits to medical facilities (dispensaries) set up in the meantime. These facilities are usually very close to where the camp residents live. This does not mean, however, that people will turn up in droves to be immunized. In camps, the simplest solution is to ask the local EPI to take charge of the immunization campaign; if that is not possible, all or some of the necessary equipment and personnel will have to be imported from abroad."
