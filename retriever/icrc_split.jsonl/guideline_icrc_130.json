"planning the facilities that will be needed. At this point nutrition rehabilitation centers (NRCs) come into the picture. # Nutrition Rehabilitation Centers Under What Circumstances Should an NRC Be Built? In deciding whether an NRC will be required, planners should consider two factors: the expected number of beneficiaries and the potential of existing local facilities. # Number of local beneficiaries If the problem is limited to a few cases of malnutrition, it is usually possible to have them admitted to a local health facility. Serious nutritional emergencies involving large populations, in contrast, produce a heavy ''demand'' for nutritional care. In this case, the establishment of facilities designed expressly to meet that demand must be considered. -The potential of existing local facilities The degree to which local facilities can meet demand varies from one situation to the next. It should be noted that in most developing countries, the relevant health services, particularly pediatric services, are already overburdened."
