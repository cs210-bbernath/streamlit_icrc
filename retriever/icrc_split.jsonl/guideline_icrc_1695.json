"c active chlorine concentrations. This concentration must therefore be allowed for in order to achieve a given concentration of chlorine in the water. In contact with water, the chemical dissolves and releases free chlorine. This free chlorine sets on the particles, notably organic particles that contain carbon, through oxidation. Particles that are living organisms (e.g. virus, bacteria) are destroyed by chlorine oxidation. Water purifi cation is completed when all particles have been bound by the chlorine. Free chlorine is thus consumed by purifi cation; consequently, the process may be considered to be completed when free chlorine remains in the water after a given contact period (this period varies according to the amount of water). Residual free chlorine is easily measured: following the required contact period, 0.5 mg of free chlorine per litre of water should remain -this amount is usually effective against possible subsequent contamination. However, the transfer of purifi ed water to unclean containers can deplete residual free chlorine entirely resulting in the preservation of some pathogens. Consequently, 0."
