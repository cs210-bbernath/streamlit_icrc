"Cross.'' # Status and structure By virtue of the mandate conferred on it by the international community in the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols, the ICRC has a specific status. Although non-governmental, its international tasks and responsibilities give it a stature which goes beyond that of a simple NGO. It is recognized as an international legal entity, and the many headquarters agreements it has concluded with States puts it on a par with intergovernmental organizations. As such, the ICRC benefits from several privileges and immunities, and its personnel usually has diplomatic status. These advantages guarantee that the ICRC can act in total independence. The specific status of the ICRC was confirmed in 1990 when the United Nations General Assembly granted it observer status. The ICRC has its headquarters in Geneva. Its governing body is the Committee, composed of up to 25 members, all of Swiss nationality and elected by co-option. The Committee meets in an Assembly, which decides matters of general policy and the acting principles of the institution."
