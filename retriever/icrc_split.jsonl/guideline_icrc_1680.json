"Restricted use Precooked or instant foods (e.g. instant C.S.M.) that require reconstitution with cold water before consumption should be avoided. They are expensive and require special instruction and supervision in preparation. Clean water is necessary for the safe use of these products and when this is not available, there are increased health hazards. They may be used very occasionally in porridges/stews in the initial phase of an operation and where fuel is scarce. Certain foods produced in industrialized countries should be used restrictively and only in exceptional situations when well monitored. These concerns are especially true for: a) milk products -the above are the subject of a special ICRC/League policy, The Use of Artifi cial Milk in Relief Actions, 1985. These are of special concern when used in infant feeding and are the subject of the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitute (WHO) 1981. b) \"high protein\" or \"high energy biscuits/tablets\" are not suitable substitutes for food -restricted use as the night meal in therapeutic feeding may be considered."
