"of dietary iron, the recommended treatment is the administration of iron tablets, usually combined with folic acid. If, however, the anaemia results from vitamin B 12 defi ciency, then this vitamin must also be administered. The treatment of anaemia resulting from iron defi ciency corrects haemoglobin imbalance within 3 to 4 months, but therapy must last for 6 to 12 months to ensure that iron reserves have been reconstituted. The treatment dosage for adults is 300 mg of ferrous sulphate twice daily, between meals. For children, it is 50 mg of ferrous sulphate per day and year age, up to 600 mg per day (12 years old and above). Doses recommended for children must be observed strictly, because excessive iron becomes toxic. Iron sulphate colours the stool black -this is harmless, but parents must be forewarned. The administration of folic acid in the form of tablets should be limited to 1 mg per day; in the case of higher doses, excess amounts are excreted in the urine."
