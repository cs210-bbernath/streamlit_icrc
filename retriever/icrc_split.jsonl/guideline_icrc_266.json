For example, epidemic meningitis develops during the dry season; the incidence of malaria, diarrheal diseases, and respiratory infections increases in the rainy season; and measles epidemics spread more easily during the dry season. It should be noted, however, that the different seasons sometimes correspond to occasions when large numbers of people are gathered together. In the case of measles, for example, the concentration of a group of vulnerable subjects probably plays a more important role in the development of an epidemic than the season during which that gathering takes place. # Possibilities of Intervention In emergency interventions, what is theoretically possible will be conditioned by practical constraints. # Theoretical Effectiveness of Technical Measures The technical solutions appropriate for a particular problem can be determined at the outset. This, in fact, means deciding which of the tools studied above are the most effective for controlling a given communicable disease. It is known, for example, that immunization against measles and oral rehydration therapy are effective,"
