One fruit and vegetable complement that supplies the lacking minerals and vitamins (especially vitamins A and C) in order to avoid potentially very serious defi ciencies. The basic food should account for roughly 50 to 60% of the energy intake if it is in the form of a cereal or potato; the protein complement then accounts for 10 to 20% of the energy intake, and the energy complement 30%.

If the basic food is cassava, it should account for no more than 40% of the energy intake, implying that the protein complement supplies approximately 30%. The drawback of cassava is its low protein content. As an illustration, a 1-year-old child, three-quarters of whose protein requirements are to be met in the form of boiled cassava (the remainder being covered by breastfeeding),"
