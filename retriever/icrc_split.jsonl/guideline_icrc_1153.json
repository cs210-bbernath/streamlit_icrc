Misuse and corruption are all too common in the case of indirect distribution, and they are impossible to correct later. The legitimacy of the operating agency and donors is also at stake. Indirect distribution is an option in the case of small communities that are easy to control and, above all, with which mutual confi dence has been established. Indirect distribution can be an option if physical access to the victims is hindered by political or security constraints; this being said, such settings are precisely those in which the danger of misuse is greatest. Indirect distribution should therefore be seen as a last resort, when no alternative exists and the life of recipients is at stake -even in such extreme cases, the approach often fails."
