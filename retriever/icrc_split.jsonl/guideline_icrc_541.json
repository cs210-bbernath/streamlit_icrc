"Too much space would be required to analyze all the facets of a health-care system here; this section will be limited to medical facilities and how they can be analyzed with the help of a flow chart. # Accessibility of the # The Basic Problem In developing countries, most of the health-care services are insufficient to respond to the needs of the population. This is the reason, for example, for the congestion of health-care facilities and the long waiting lines at water distribution points. This problem leads to dysfunction in these facilities and a lack of motivation in health-care personnel, who are swamped by a demand they cannot satisfy, and in the populations themselves, who hesitate to turn to the health-care services. In an emergency situation, demand is especially great, and without rational organization, services 22 are quickly overwhelmed. Certainly, a doubling of the population in the space of a few weeks in a city of average size often strains the capacity of hospital facilities intolerably."
