"particularly long. It is unrealistic to try to collect all the data possible, since that would require a great deal of time and a large staff, and the sheer volume of the data collected would make analysis difficult. The quest for information is best limited to certain health indicators, chosen for their relevance in describing a given situation or its evolution over time. # Indicators Directly Related to Health Status Indicators directly related to health status are the following: # Mortality Disaster situations often involve very high mortality among the victims. Mortality rates are by far the most valuable indicator for measuring the impact of a relief operation. 2 # Morbidity Monitoring changes in morbidity allows epidemiologists to determine its main causes, to gauge the impact of preventive measures taken to benefit populations affected by a disaster, to sound the alarm when epidemics threaten, etc. # Nutritional Status Nutritional status is reflected by the rate of malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies."
