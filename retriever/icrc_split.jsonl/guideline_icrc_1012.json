"cluster sampling methods reduce this type of constraint substantially. Another (less rigorous) random sampling method produces accurate results, provided that the enquiry area is homogenous with respect to the variable under scrutiny. The observer places an empty bottle (or a pencil on a book) as close as possible to the centre of the area under consideration, spins it, and systematically selects all subjects in the direction indicated by the bottleneck, and as far as the area extends in that direction. If the number of subjects is insuffi cient, the exercise may be repeated as often as necessary. This method saves the effort and time required for census or accurate subject counting. Simple random sampling is illustrated in Figures 10.5 and 10.6 below. Figure 10.5 Simple random sampling -example 1 16 Of course, these are not perfect random numbers because they are generated using an algorithm, but they are near enough for all practical purposes. In the case of EXCEL computer spreadsheets, all the names, or subject identities,"
