"calculations. & Confidence limits: The confidence limits are equivalent to the degree of accuracy. This corresponds to the acceptable number of standard errors multiplied by the standard error itself: d = z x SE. Since SE is unknown, 25 The standard error is calculated as follows: Standard error = standard deviation (estimated by sample) square root of the size of the sample 26 Values under 95% are not normally taken, but 99% can be taken as a confidence level. In this case, the number of standard errors must be altered (2.54 for 99%). # Distribution of Means of Repeated Samples Taken within the Same Population The average of the means found in repeated samples of the same population is equal to the true mean the global value of d is estimated -that is, the sample must be large enough so that at 95% the value found by sampling is sure to fall +d from the true mean."
