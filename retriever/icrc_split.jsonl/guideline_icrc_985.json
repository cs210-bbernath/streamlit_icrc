"cases with the defi ned feature (true positives) it reveals, but at the same time it will reveal more cases to appear that seem to share this feature but in fact do not (false positives). The greater the sensitivity, the lower the ability to select only true positives is. Inversely, the more specifi c an indicator is, the greater its ability to detect cases that are not positive (true negatives), but it also detects more cases that appear not to share the feature when they in fact do (false negatives). The greater the specifi city, the lower the ability to detect all true positives is. Anthropometric indicators provide a good illustration: if the severe malnutrition threshold is set at -2 standard deviations of the MUAC-for-height reference value, then the resulting indicator is highly sensitive and reveals all cases of severe malnutrition, but also many cases of moderate or mild malnutrition. If on the other hand the threshold is set at -4 standard deviations,"
