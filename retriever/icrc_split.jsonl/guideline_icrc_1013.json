"for all practical purposes. In the case of EXCEL computer spreadsheets, all the names, or subject identities, are pasted in one column; the next column should then contain the function =RAND() -this produces random numbers between 0 and 1, which can then be sorted. In Figure 10.5, the subjects are numbered and randomly pre-selected; in Figure 10.6 they are not identifi ed individually prior to sampling, but are selected according to a general random direction, within an area that is suffi ciently homogenous for all individuals to be representative of the overall population. # Systematic random sampling Systematic sampling consists in selecting subjects at regular intervals (for example, every fi fth individual), starting from the fi rst subject, which is selected randomly. This method implies a comprehensive census and numbering of the population under scrutiny; it also requires a sound understanding of the local geographic or spatial organization in order to, in this case, count all subjects and then select those (in this example, every fi fth)"
