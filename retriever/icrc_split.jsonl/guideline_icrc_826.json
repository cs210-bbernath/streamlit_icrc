"these cells is short (some four months), and their constantly renewed synthesis causes signifi cant dependency on factors that may inhibit their synthesis or that of haemoglobin. According to these limiting factors, anaemia may be microcytic (in which red blood cells are unusually small), macrocytic or megaloblastic (unusually large red blood cells), haemolytic (many red blood cells are destroyed), or hypochromic (red blood cells contain little haemoglobin). Folic acid and vitamin B 12 are the major limiting factors because of their contribution to synthesis in the bone marrow, whereas iron is limiting because it is a constituent of haemoglobin. Defi ciency in folic acid and vitamin B 12 induces macrocytic anaemia, whereas iron defi ciency induces microcytic and hypochromic anaemia. Anaemia caused by iron defi ciency in the organism and defi ciency in folic acid and vitamin B 12 is called dimorphic anaemia. It is common among poor populations. This Manual considers the two main causes of anaemia, being iron defi ciency in the organism, and folic acid defi ciency."
