"Type II nutrient balance must be observed. The above has led Briend and Golden to recommend the use of F-75 Formula, as detailed in Table 13.5 below (Briend & Golden, 1997); this diet is adapted to the initial treatment of severely malnourished individuals that present both kwashiorkor and marasmus. Briend and Golden have also devised the F-100 Formula, used during rehabilitation, which contains higher energy and protein concentrations, with the same micro-nutrient content. F-75 Formula supplies roughly 75 kcal (313 kJ) per 100 ml (hence its name), with a protein-energy ratio 24 (P/E ratio) of approximately 5%, and a lipid-energy ratio of approximately 35%. Opinions differ as to the use of F-75 Formula during initial treatment because its energy concentration is low, it introduces a new product and additional complications for kitchen staff to handle, while the use of more concentrated solutions has yielded equally good results. However, in severely wasted patients and those suffering from kwashiorkor, F-75 Formula is without question most appropriate and avoids, in particular, protein overload."
