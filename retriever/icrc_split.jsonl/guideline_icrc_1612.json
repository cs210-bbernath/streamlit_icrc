"mug or spoon, or instilled slowly by inserting a syringe gently into the corner of the mouth. After administering treatment solutions, operating staff must monitor patients until they become alert, feed them F-75 Formula regularly, and check for infection and treatment where relevant. # Hypothermia Hypothermia is proportional to the seriousness of severe malnutrition. On the one hand, body temperature is sub-standard because the basal metabolism diminishes with malnutrition; on the other, the lower critical temperature 17 is higher, whereas the capacity for thermo-genesis of the organism diminishes with ambient temperature (among other things, malnourished children are unable to shiver). As a result, mortality peaks among famished, unsheltered groups occur at dawn and in rainy conditions. Hypothermia is prevented by feeding patients adequately and regularly, and supplying them with appropriate shelter, that is: 9 avoiding draughts; 9 ensuring an ambient temperature above 25\u00b0C; 9 supplying clothing and bedding; 9 maintaining direct contact with carers or close relatives. Hypothermia (rectal temperature lower than 35.5\u00b0C)"
