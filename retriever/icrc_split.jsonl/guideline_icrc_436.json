"within the limits constituted by the mean and +2 standard deviations. If we take the example of the birth weights of a group of children where the arithmetic mean is 3 kilos and the standard deviation is 400 grams, 95% of the birth weights can be assumed to fall between 2.2 kilos and 3.8 kilos. # Implications for Emergency Situations The standard deviation is the measure of variability most commonly used. The method of calculating the standard deviation should be properly understood, even though the EPIINFO computer program performs it automatically. # Measures of Comparison By comparing the values for two different populations, an evaluator can perceive possible differe n c e s b e t w e e n t h e t w o . Comparing raw data is useless; they can only be compared as rates or percentages (same denominator). # Relative Risk Relative risk is a useful concept in analysis, since it is the ratio between the rates of a variable measured in two populations,"
