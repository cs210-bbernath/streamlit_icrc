"use of sampling error and confi dence intervals. The process may nevertheless be undermined by an unexpectedly low turnout of subjects due to estimation mistakes (these subjects may simply not exist) or absenteeism. Investigation must therefore determine whether the entire population has indeed been measured and, if not, why. The ensuing process is determined by the magnitude of the possible error, and the objectives of the assessment. Returning to the previous example, if only 1,000 subjects are measured, 13% of assumed subjects are missing: how does this infl uence results? To provide an answer, the 200 missing subjects are arbitrarily included in the severe or normal category: these are both extremes and highly unlikely, but doing so provides an indication as to most optimistic and pessimistic results. If among 1,000 subjects, 20% have shown severe wasting, 50% moderate wasting, and 30% an acceptable nutritional status, the 200 missing subjects should fi rst be considered as severely wasted. The adjusted distribution is then 33% severe wasting, 42% moderate wasting,"
