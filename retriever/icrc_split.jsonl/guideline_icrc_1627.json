"ACCORDING TO SFP OBJECTIVES SFPs can pursue the following objectives in crisis situations: 9 temporarily containing malnutrition, morbidity and mortality; 9 contributing to a more effective response to moderate malnutrition; 9 providing a safety net; 9 providing a relay for therapeutic feeding.

The community under consideration must be aware of what it may expect from an SFP, its limitations, and the criteria for selection and screening. It must take part in the programme's design, implementation, assessment and proposed adjustments, if necessary. # Temporarily containing malnutrition, morbidity and mortality Where this is the SFP's objective, it indicates a deteriorating or acute crisis, and signals that the main problem is inadequate access to food. Two targeting options result. The fi rst concerns individuals depending on specifi c criteria."
