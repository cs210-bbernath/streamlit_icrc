"the food basket. # a) The shelf life of food should normally be at least 6 months after arrival in the country and stored in such a way to keep the food quality in terms of taste, texture and nutritional content. Packages of food should be labelled with production date and expiry date. Donated foods must be packaged in a way to stand hot, humid climates and rough handling. Guidelines to good warehouse management should be provided and followed to prevent unnecessary wastage. # b) Fortifi ed foods must be accurately and clearly labelled. All foods should be in appropriate packages and clearly labelled in the offi cial international language used by the recipients regarding its contents or ingredients and instructions for use. This facilitates the acceptability from a cultural and religious point of view and ensures proper usage. This is particularly important for tinned foods and blended dried foods in sacks."
