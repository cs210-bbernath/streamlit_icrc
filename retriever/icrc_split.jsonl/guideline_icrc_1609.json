"MUAC variations thus indicate variations in these two tissues exclusively. As observed by Briend, the measurement of mid-upper arm circumference therefore provides a better indication of mortality risks than does weight-for-height (Briend, 1995). On the other hand, progress is measured in a TFC according to weight (once oedema, intestinal parasites, infection and infl ammation have been treated), because weight gain per kilogram provides a reliable catch-up criterion. Furthermore, muscular catch-up may occur fi rst in the lower limbs rather than the upper limbs, because the legs are solicited fi rst when children recover their mobility and curiosity. In such circumstances MUAC does not refl ect actual nutritional catch-up in the early stages of recovery. When the author resorts to anthropometry, the selection criterion (or cut-off point) is a MUACfor-height lower than 75% of the reference, or -3 Z-scores. Many agencies apply the cut-off point of weight-for-height inferior to -3 Z-scores. A MUAC inferior to 11 cm is sometimes used also -this is rather severe,"
