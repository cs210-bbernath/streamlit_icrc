"the displaced people themselves (although they may have a certain degree of immunity), but the local population may also be affected, being usually much more sensitive to a new pathogenic agent. Conversely, by changing environment, a displaced population may be confronted by a new pathogenic agent against which it has no immunity. 3 # Susceptibility of the Population A population's susceptibility to disease is reflected at two levels: the population's immunity and the individual's immunity. After several years in camps in Thailand, where antimalarial control is particularly strict, the Cambodians returning to Cambodia were exposed to Plasmodium falciparum, against which most of them had lost their natural immunity. # Immunity of the Population Every community possesses a certain degree of immunity: ''There is nothing mysterious about the high resistance which certain groups of people have to particular diseases.
