"environment depends on such factors as security conditions and the scope of ''military necessity.'' Finally, if the civilian population remains on its home ground, its means of subsistence must be protected. Here again, health-care personnel can turn to legal instruments. # Protection of Means of Subsistence Article 14 of Protocol II guarantees the protection of goods indispensable to survival: ''Starvation of civilians as a method of combat is prohibited. It is therefore prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless, for that purpose, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works.'' This article is clear. However, a point brought out by the Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 merits reflection; it refers to failures to take the necessary measures to supply a population with goods indispensable for survival."
