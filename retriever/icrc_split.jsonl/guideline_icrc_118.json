On the practical level, the trend is increasingly to supply a supplement to the basic ration distributed to families, consisting of foods chosen to compensate for the specific deficiencies of the basic ration. The resulting increase in the basic ration is essentially intended to respond to the specific nutritional needs of the vulnerable groups, rather than the general quantitative needs of the family."
