"consists mainly of an immediate improvement in the diet. Niacin is found in most foods in limited amounts, however meat (especially offal), fi sh, beer yeast, peanuts, and wholemeal barley and wheat all contain higher concentrations. Animal products are particularly good sources of niacin because, in addition to their high niacin concentrations, they also contain signifi cant amounts of its precursor, tryptophan. However, the synthesis of niacin from tryptophan involves ribofl avin and vitamin B 6 ; rations intended to prevent niacin defi ciency must therefore be balanced, particularly in terms of other B group vitamins. If the dietary micro-nutrient intake cannot be balanced, all vitamins and minerals should be supplied in amounts consistent with recommended daily intakes. The excessive reliance on maize should then be mitigated by promoting dietary diversifi cation through the production and consumption of niacin-rich (e.g. cereals other than maize, and legumes, particularly peanuts) or tryptophan-rich (animal products) foods. The use of low-extraction fl ours should be discouraged,"
