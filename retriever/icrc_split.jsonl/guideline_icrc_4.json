This request for support may be made formally on the basis of Article 1 common to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions (obligation to \"ensure respect\"). # Support: cooperation with ineffectual authorities Support activities are aimed at the authorities themselves, and are intended to help them to fulfil their responsibilities. Such support may be in many forms: material support and help with training activities, assistance in the areas of management and coordination, for example. It presupposes a relationship of trust with the authorities, the cooperation of those authorities, and previous agreement on the objectives to be achieved and the appropriate time frame."
