"however the intended accuracy can be reduced, provided that this still produces results that are relevant to operations, that is, that permit decision-making. Intended accuracy has the greatest impact on sample size. Correction for small populations Population size does not in principle infl uence sample size. However, in small populations, a correction factor may be used. A small population is one in which the sample \"n\" as calculated above exceeds 10% of the total population \"N\". In such cases, the corrected sample is calculated as follows: corrected n = n / Referring to the above example: n = 246 N = the total population, say 2,000 subjects In this example, the sample size is reduced by 11%. Had the total population been 1,000 subjects, the corrected sample size would be 197 subjects, that is, a 20% reduction in sample size. Sample size for systematic random sampling, and for each unit in stratifi ed sampling, is calculated in the same way as for simple random sampling."
