"rations must be designed on the basis of simple and easily found foods and ingredients. Table 12.3 below suggests a list of such foodstuffs, indicating their average protein and energy content, in addition to ingredients that are included in order to enhance fl avour and diversity. Calorie and protein variations clearly occur according to the type of foodstuff chosen, but they are usually minimal with respect to the uncertainty related to context-specifi c calorie requirements. The foodstuffs indicated below represent the major food groups that can be included in GFD. Other foods may of course be included, provided that they comply with local eating habits. CSB should supply the micro-nutrients that are lacking in rations containing only cereals, legumes, and oil according to recommended daily intakes. c Fruits and vegetables supply micro-nutrients and enhance the fl avour of the diet. Their calorie and protein content does not affect ration calculation. d Canned fi sh is understood as preserved in oil and not brine."
