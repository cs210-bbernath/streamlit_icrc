"are difficult to analyze, but remain relevant in an emergency situation. # The Political Environment In conflict situations, it is essential to consider indicators reflecting the political situation. Some political decisions have direct consequences for the victims' health status -for example, in the case of forced population displacements, or restrictions on access to food or medical services. Having defined the type and number of indicators required, the epidemiologist must determine where the necessary data can be found. # Sources of Information Depending on the information sought, several sources are possible: # The Population During the initial assessment, when the health services are not yet in a position to furnish precise data, the population itself is the only possible source of information. For the purposes of a surveillance system, however, it is still preferable to seek facts from the health services rather than the population, except in the case of research specifically concerning the latter."
