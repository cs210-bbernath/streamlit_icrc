"setting the calorie level of rations on a nutritional basis, the fact that food represents more than just nutrients and calories must also be considered. Indeed, its fundamental nutritional role provides it with social, economic and political dimensions that shape its use, and often makes it a vital issue. # The social dimension of food Food must be consumed daily in order to meet the nutritional need of humans. In primitive societies, most production activities are related to the securing of food, which thus plays a central role.
