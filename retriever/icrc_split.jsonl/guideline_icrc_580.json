"In addition, economic difficulties have driven rural populations into the cities, where they are concentrated in unsafe areas (for example, the flooded regions in El Salvador in 1989). Development itself is a source of vulnerability. Agricultural policies that advocate single-crop farming leave farmers with nothing to fall back on in case of accidents, be they climatic, agronomic (crop diseases), or economic (price collapse). 29 In this case, the most vulnerable families will be those with a low production capacity due to the limited land available to them for cultivation. # National Economic Vulnerability Inconsistent economic development policies, corruption, and city officials' lack of interest in rural areas are a few of the factors that help increase the vulnerability of populations at the end of the economic chain. Economic underdevelopment means that the installation of infrastructure essential to the economy cannot be financed. This plays a major role in disasters, in which the road network, means of communication (telephone), etc., are so important."
