"for a set of samples of identical size will fall between the value of the true mean and +2 standard errors. & The confidence level: Turning this reasoning around, it can be said that there is a 96% chance that the mean obtained from ONE sample will fall somewhere between +2 standard errors and the true mean. In general, this reasoning works as follows: With a 95% 26 probability, the value found is sure to fall between +1.96 standard errors relative to the true mean, or, from a pessimist's point of view, there will be a 5% risk that the value found in the sample will deviate by more than two standard errors from the true value (x errors). The formula 1.96 = z (where z is the number of standard errors between the true mean and the sample mean) is important to remember, for it appears in numerous statistical calculations. & Confidence limits: The confidence limits are equivalent to the degree of accuracy."
