"each. n = 1. Another approach consists in deciding arbitrarily to select 30 clusters of 30 subjects each. This practice is common in humanitarian assessment, and avoids tedious calculation and sampling error, and provides good results. For a 5% sampling error, the expected accuracy in relation to different expected prevalence rates is the following: Once the assessment has been completed, accuracy must be corrected by applying a formula that allows for the cluster effect. The closer the results for different clusters match, the closer accuracy is to the above fi gures. Cluster sampling does not require correction for small populations: it is best to use the largest possible sample anyway, and cluster sampling is usually applied to populations that are larger than ten times the sample.
