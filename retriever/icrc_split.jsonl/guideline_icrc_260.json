"population comes to the fore here. 43 The community may see its problems differently from the health professionals. They do not necessarily have the same priorities. & Study a population's behavior and customs when faced with the problems identified. This includes factors such as: -care of sick children; -knowledge or ignorance of rehydration therapy for diarrheal disease; -propensity to seek help from health services or traditional doctors; -quality of personal hygiene. & Set objectives. If the goal is to have mothers rehydrate their children during attacks of diarrhea, it will be necessary, for example, to: -make mothers aware of the risks of dehydration; -teach mothers to prepare a rehydration solution; -make mothers aware of the importance of continuing to breastfeed during a diarrheal episode. & Determine the appropriate measures. Appropriate measures are: -culturally acceptable to the population; -effective in treating the health problem in question; -feasible in the context of the emergency."
