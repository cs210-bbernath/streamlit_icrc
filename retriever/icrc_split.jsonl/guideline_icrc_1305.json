"the determining parameter. In famine, the number of severely malnourished subjects is always suffi cient to justify therapeutic feeding and the introduction of a TFC. However, a threshold number of individuals must be set when a given phenomenon affects the nutritional status only marginally, and when severe malnutrition is scattered. This number can vary between 20 and 100, depending on the operating agency and circumstances. The prevalence rate of severe malnutrition provides a useful indicator in setting this number, and this rate must then be compared to the size of the population, its geographic dispersion, and access to it. For example, in a camp that accommodates 10,000 persons whose demographic profi le is that of a developing country, 10% rate of severe malnutrition recorded in children under 6 years of age means that 150 children from this camp require TFC attention. This is feasible, because camps are rather easy to manage: individuals can be targeted easily, distances are reasonable, and access to the population is ensured."
