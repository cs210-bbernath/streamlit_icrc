"might appear. The following parameters must be taken into account: The word ''person'' is traditionally used in epidemiological manuals. Obviously, however, a health indicator may also correspond to objects, as in the study of the bacteria in a water source. # Representativeness Representativeness is the concordance between the elements sought and those that the test actually finds. The indicators that may be chosen in an emergency are not necessarily the same that would be used in a normal situation. For example, the anthropometric measurements of weight for height and weight for age are used to detect conditions of severe malnutrition. Weight-for-height, however, is used to measure acute severe malnutrition, while weight-for-age can indicate both acute and chronic severe malnutrition. For this reason, the results obtained with the weight-for-age method are not representative of a problem of severe acute malnutrition which arises abruptly during a disaster. # Choice of Variables for Interpreting Indicator Variations # Validity The validity of a test is characterized by two properties, sensitivity and specificity."
