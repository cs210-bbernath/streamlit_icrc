"Appraisal of opportunities and constraints. Appraisal of necessary accompanying protection measures (assistance and representation). Necessary decisions following the assessment, and required follow-up. # ANNEX 12 # IMPROVING WATER QUALITY IN A THERAPEUTIC FEEDING CENTRE Both the quality and the quantity of the water supply must be adequate in a therapeutic feeding centre (TFC) in order to ensure appropriate care and feeding. The recommended amount of water is usually 30 l per patient and per day; 10 litres are the absolute minimum. This amount applies to the type of TFC that is common in disasters in developing countries; it may however be much greater in modern facilities equipped with fl ush toilets, showers, pressure cookers, and laundry machines. These are usually connected to water supply networks, and in that case the water need not be fi ltered or purifi ed. Improving the water quality in a TFC involves the use of several methods, which may be combined according to need and available means: sedimentation, fi ltering, and purifi cation."
