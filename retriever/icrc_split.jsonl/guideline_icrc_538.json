The mobile teams move on, the patients remain. # Accessibility and Economic Restrictions Many health services, particularly curative services, are accessible only to paying patients. A situation of conflict aggravates preexisting economic differences and tends to reduce equitable access to health services. This factor may be one of the reasons that the victims of conflict tend to congregate in places where health services are accessible. # Accessibility and Security Unsafe conditions may prevent access to a population's usual services, for example, to health facilities. They may also restrict an entire population's access to its immediate environment.

The destruction of communication routes (bridges, for example) may also cut off access to local services."
