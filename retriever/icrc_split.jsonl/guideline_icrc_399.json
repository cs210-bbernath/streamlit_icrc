"highly reductionist view of the problem completely obscures the fact that the outcome of a surgical intervention depends on the functioning of a chain that begins with the first aid provided at the site of the injury, and ends with the rehabilitation measures designed to minimize a handicap. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, the old saying goes -but as the cliche\u00b4rightly indicates, operations to benefit the war-wounded must be conceived on a global scale. The absence or mediocrity of first aid will be reflected in: # Chain of Care for Casualties in Conflict Situations . an increased number of deaths on the field of combat; . an increased number of wounded who are suffering from shock (uncontrolled bleeding) when brought to the hospital; an increased number of infected wounds (if evacuation is slow). The absence or mediocrity of an advance medical post and of means of medical transport will have the same effect."
