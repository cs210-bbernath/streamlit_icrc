"familiar with the principle of integrating the different sanitation measures, with each other and with health-education activities. This subject will not be discussed further in this chapter, but will be raised again in connection with diarrheal illnesses (Chapter 4, ''Communicable Diseases''). The next section will cover the technical principles involved in a water-supply system. # Water-Supply Techniques In disaster situations, water-supply systems are often partially destroyed, or the materials necessary to maintain them are lacking. In such cases, relief workers must determine to what extent the missing elements can be replaced. When, due to an exceptional situation, populations are displaced, they occasionally find refuge in an area containing no infrastructure for providing water. In such cases, a water system furnishing the minimum quantity of water consistent with the norms described earlier must be put together quickly. We will take this type of situation as our primary example in studying basic watersupply techniques. This study will follow a logical progression,"
