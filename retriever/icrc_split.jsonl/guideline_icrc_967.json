"and the action of non-human predators. It also consists in detecting the action and impact of human and non-human predators at the time of harvest, to determine whether the harvest was collected prematurely or not and, if so, why. Finally, it involves the documentation of how farmers use their harvest, and how they describe the current and future (i.e. until the next harvest) situation, their intentions, expectations, and demands, and whether the latter amount, objectively, to a need for assistance. The capacity of local health services (dispensaries, hospitals, nutritional rehabilitation centres) at the onset of the rains must also be appraised, because this season is usually marked by epidemics of contagious diseases, causing a signifi cant increase in severe malnutrition.
