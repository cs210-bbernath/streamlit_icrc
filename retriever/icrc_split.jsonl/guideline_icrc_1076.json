This is not surprising in view of the many possible causes of pathological malnutrition. Anthropometry therefore remains a sound indicator of nutritional reserves or past growth patterns, but only provides an estimate of nutritional status. # The choice of index Anthropometry nevertheless remains essential in many circumstances. The points discussed here are intended to facilitate the selection of an index that is relevant to the dimension under investigation. The cut-off points discussed earlier are commonly used, but their meaning requires some attention. It goes without saying that the choice of index and cut-off points is determined by the overall purpose in doing so. However, choices are still all too often dictated by imitation or habit, rather than by actual thought as to the investigated issue."
