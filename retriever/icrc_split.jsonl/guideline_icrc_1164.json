"GFD cannot allow for individual nutritional needs; even if it could, the effort would be pointless as the # NUTRITION MANUAL Chapter XII -General food distribution 3. GFD implementation 3.2 Setting rations several rations would in any case end up in the communal cooking pots and be allocated according to eating habits and priorities set by the family and not the distributing agency. Moreover, if the family does not consume the entire ration, then the lengthy process of setting individual rations would lose its purpose altogether. It is therefore best to defi ne the average nutritional need of the overall target population, according to its demographic distribution, its average level of physical activity (expressed as a multiplication factor of the basal metabolism) and, where relevant, its environment. The number of rations that each household receives is determined by the number of its members; and the amount of food received by each household is usually suffi cient because each household is more or less a microcosm of the overall population."
