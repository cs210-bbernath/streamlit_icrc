"breastfeeding diminishes. This progression results from the substantial energy requirements per kilogram in infants, considering that their stomach is small and that they can only be fed small amounts at a time (150 ml between 6 and 12 months old, and 200 to 300 ml between 2 and 3 years). The energy density of weaning foods must therefore be suffi cient, and this is usually only achieved by adding fats; fats must nevertheless not account for more than 30% of the energy intake. Fats also make porridges smoother, which consequently do not require the addition of water as they cool off and congeal. For example, a 12-month child weighing 10 kg, whose energy requirement is approximately 1,000 kcal (4,180 kJ), one-quarter of which is supplied by maternal milk, will need the rest to be supplied in the form of 220 g of a cereal-legume blend if no oil is added; this represents a cooked food volume of roughly 800 ml, to be fed in fi ve meals at least."
