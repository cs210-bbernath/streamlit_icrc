"indicate the different sources they rely on. These different issues, or sources, are then entered in the rows and columns of a matrix; the heading of column 1 is identical to that of row 1, that of column 2 is identical to that of column 2, and so on. Issues are then compared to one another once, and informants asked to state their preference; for example, \"Do you prefer issue 1 or issue 2?\" or \"Which is more important: source 1 or source 2?\". The answer is then recorded in the corresponding box. The issue, or source, that is most frequently selected is the most important (i.e. it has the highest priority); this permits the ranking of all issues or sources by order of importance (See Figure 12). # Figure 12 Pair-wise ranking -example of food sources In the example in Figure 12, totals are as follows: I Production was found to be more important three times: 3. I Gathering was said to be more important twice: 2."
