"but rather to illustrate their role through a few examples. In situations of armed conflict, needs are not limited to health care, but also include measures to protect the victims. The intervention of humanitarian agencies is occasionally made difficult by the complexity of the political environment, which in many cases restricts access to the victims. Respect for a humanitarian ethic is essential, despite the constraints inherent in situations of armed conflict. Under no circumstances should the difficulties encountered serve as an excuse for interventions that are thirdrate or even dangerous for the victims. Consultation, coordination, and cooperation between agencies are the basis for a code of conduct governing the relations between them. However, these forms of collaboration must respect the specific mandate and/or intervention strategies of each humanitarian organization. Mention the word ''war'', and our thoughts turn at once to those most directly affected: the dead and wounded, prisoners, those who have gone missing or been separated from their families, those who have been forced to flee."
