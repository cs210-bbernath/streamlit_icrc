"from which the sample is drawn is in fact not very important, and it may not even be known. For a given sample size, it is better to choose a large number of clusters and a small number of individuals in each cluster rather than the contrary. 34 In our example, 7 children (6.4 rounded off to 7) will be examined in each cluster, giving a final total of 210 children. 35 Let us take the example of measuring the prevalence of malnutrition in famine-stricken areas, with the following parameters: -confidence level = 95%; -estimated prevalence of <80% weight-for-height = 20%; -confidence limits = +5%. n = Z 2 (p) (1 -q) (DEFF) # N = Z 2 pq D 2 A total of 400 children would have to be included in the study -either 30 clusters of 14 children or 50 clusters of 8 children. Increasing the number of subjects in each cluster will not significantly increase the accuracy of the results;"
