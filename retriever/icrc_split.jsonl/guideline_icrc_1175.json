"material, etc.), and clothing and blankets for thermal comfort. Such measures against the cold are usually taken once only (one-off supplies), whereas adjustments to food rations must then be adhered to permanently, involving a signifi cant increase in the overall cost of the operation. That being said, increasing rations is sometimes justifi ed, and the decision must involve nutritionist input. It is worth noting here that, if the organism cannot maintain its normal temperature, the resulting hypothermia is usually fatal below 25\u00b0C. The chilling of a malnourished individual, poorly clad and exposed to the elements (as is often the case in disaster), is extremely rapid. In famines, malnutrition becomes generalized and extreme, and mortality among the homeless peaks at night-time and in rainy conditions. Clearly, humanitarian ethics demand that acceptable habitat and thermal comfort conditions be ensured whenever feasible. If these conditions are satisfactory, rations must nevertheless be adapted to the ambient temperature, in compliance with the recommendations issued by the World Food Programme (WFP)"
