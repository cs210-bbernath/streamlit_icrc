"to sit down? This sort of question may seem trivial during an emergency situation, but relief workers should keep in mind that the warmth of the patient's reception will largely determine the quality of the relations between patients and health-care personnel. # Taking the Patient History An emergency often serves as an excuse to cut short the patient's recital of complaints. Lacking a complete patient history, however, the care provider risks misdiagnosing the problem. Moreover, when the health-care personnel (expatriates, for example) are working in an unfamiliar cultural context, the quality of the patient history is apt to suffer. # The Clinical Examination Traditionally, the clinical examination is an essential step in the care-giving process; in an emergency situation, its importance is all the greater because its quality must compensate for both the deficiencies of the patient history and the lack of the technical means for radiological and biological tests."
