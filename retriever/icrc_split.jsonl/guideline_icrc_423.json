"parasites are detected in a microscopic examination does not formally rule out malarial infection. # Principle of Test Sensitivity and Specificity Test Healthy subjects Sick subjects Results: The capacity of the test to distinguish sick subjects (sensitivity) and healthy subjects (specificity) # PPV = true + (true +) + (false +) # PPV # Sick Yes No In an emergency situation, the tendency is to try to treat as many subjects as possible by reducing the number of true positive cases tagged as negative by the test. This orientation gives sensitivity priority over specificity. # Standardization Except in cases of changed prevalence, as mentioned above, the same measuring method should be used for a given indicator so that data from different sources or collected at different times can be compared. The fact that humanitarian agencies work with different indicators and measurement tests does not favor the exchange of information. Similarly, humanitarian agencies should take note of the locally used methods and determine to what extent they should be used."
