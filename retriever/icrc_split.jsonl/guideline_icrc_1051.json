"the nutritional status of a given population provides reasonably accurate data regarding its nutritional condition. Its strength lies in the clear credibility of quantitative data, and high malnutrition rates prompt immediate action. Its weakness however lies in the fact that it is often considered as the prime method to decide upon humanitarian action. This is a conceptual aberration, because data in itself does not explain the lead-up to the situation nor its evolution in any way. As discussed in Chapter VI, measuring nutritional status provides a single indicator of the entire feeding process and its overall functioning. This indicator however only permits late action, particularly if it provides the main criterion for assistance. As a result, it does not meet the objectives of humanitarian action, which for example cannot be delayed until 30% of a given population has lost 20% of its weight. Aid would in this case be too late; but it may also be too late if the situation improves before its delivery -aid would then be redundant."
