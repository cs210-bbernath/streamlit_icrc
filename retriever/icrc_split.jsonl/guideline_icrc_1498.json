"to 60% of the overall energy intake in a 2,400 kcal (10,000 kJ) ration -this amounts to roughly the daily ration of an adult man with light physical activity. In this ration, the protein complement balances the amino-acid intake, which is especially important in small children. If tubers account for most of the staple food, protein complement in the form of legumes should exceed 60 g in the case of cassava, plantain, or sago: if the staple food (for example cassava) accounts for approximately 70% of the overall energy content of a 2,400 kcal (10,000 kJ) ration, the rest being supplied by the energy and protein complements, then the protein intake is 7 g of protein approximately. In that case, at least 38 g of protein are lacking in order to match recommended intakes, without even considering digestibility and the biological utilization of protein. In that case, the protein complement supplies the lacking protein -it is no longer then a matter of balancing the amino-acid intake,"
