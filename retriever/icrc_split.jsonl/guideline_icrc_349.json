"by great population mobility, the aim should be to institute effective treatments that do not require repeated visits to the medical facilities. However, entrusting the patient with all the drugs he will need for a full course of treatment carries the usual risk of patient non-compliance (the drugs received may be sold, used for other members of the family, etc.). For a certain number of pathologies, the care provider may choose between a conventional course of treatment (several daily doses administered over several days) and a single-dose treatment. Usually, they are equally effective. However, in view of the non-compliance so frequently observed in the longer course of treatment, the single-dose treatment often proves to be the more effective. In addition, it does not demand as much of the health-care personnel's time and energy. Its main disadvantages are that it is often more expensive, and that it does not correspond to local therapeutic practice. In every situation, the pros and cons of the two approaches must be weighed."
