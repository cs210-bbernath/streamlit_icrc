"theirs if access to food were suffi cient, and that their physical capacity is substantially diminished. This observation was in fact confi rmed in the case of a specifi c prison in which undernourished and highly wasted inmates fi nally gained unlimited access to an adequate diet. Their food consumption initially rose dramatically, and then stabilized. Measurements taken three weeks after stabilization indicated an average 22 BMI, with a 1.9 standard deviation. Clearly, a balance had been found between dietary intake and energy expenditure. As a result, the new WHO classifi cation may tend to underestimate mild malnutrition in adult males; this can have serious consequences for humanitarian action. Moreover, the suggested brackets imply a 7.5% weight loss between mild and moderate malnutrition, and only a 6% one between moderate and severe malnutrition: is such sophistication really necessary? This Manual therefore prefers to refer to the previous classifi cation discussed above; it matches reality more closely, and its cut-off points are more relevant to humanitarian action."
