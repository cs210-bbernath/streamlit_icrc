"ml/meal to all children, permitting the supervised redistribution of remainders to those who were still hungry or their carers. # NUTRITION MANUAL # CHAPTER XIV # SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING PROGRAMMES # DEFINITION Supplementary Feeding Programmes 1 (SFPs) provide food supplements to individuals or groups of individuals considered as vulnerable within a given community. This vulnerability is either physiological (slightly to moderately malnourished individuals, pre-school age children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, the elderly and the sick), or related to specifi c living conditions to be found mainly in institutions such as hospitals, orphanages, homes for the elderly and prisons -this does not preclude general food distributions (GFD) in such environments. SFPs are thus understood in contrast to GFDs, 2 which target individuals forming overall households, and therapeutic feeding, 3 which is aimed at severely malnourished individuals. SFPs are discussed after therapeutic feeding, owing to their hybrid role between the two really effective nutritional measures in crisis: GFDs to forestall malnutrition, and therapeutic feeding to address severe forms of malnutrition."
