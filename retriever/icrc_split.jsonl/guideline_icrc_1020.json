"based on the example of a total population of 30,000 subjects. The number of clusters per section is then defi ned in order to complete column 5; this is done by defi ning an interval size \"a\" that amounts to the total population divided by the total number of clusters \"k\" (in this example, 30). The interval size in the above example is 30,000 / 30 = 1,000. A number is randomly selected between 1 and 1,000 to provide the starting point for cluster selection, say 455. The fi rst cluster is then attributed to the sub-section that corresponds to 455, in this example, sub-section 2. The following clusters are obtained by adding 1,000 (the interval) to the fi rst number (455): 1,455; 2,455 (both are included in section 2, like the fi rst value 455); 3,455 (section 3); 4,455; 5,455; 6,455; 7,455 (all included in section 4); and so on."
