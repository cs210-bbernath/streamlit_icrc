"must not, of course, be neglected; it should correspond to the norms defined above. From a practical point of view, if it is necessary to choose between supplying small quantities of pure water or large quantities of water containing a few coli bacilli, then the latter option is preferable. # Malnutrition The impact of water supply on nutritional status shows quite clearly that water quantity and quality are closely linked. A study carried out in Madras, 14 for example, shows that for children under the age of three years, water quality is relatively more important, while quantity is more significant for children over that age. The main thing to remember is that water, through its role in the transmission of diarrheal diseases, has an impact on nutritional status. At this point, we know the norms for supplying water and the risks we run by deviating from them. We are also familiar with the principle of integrating the different sanitation measures, with each other and with health-education activities."
