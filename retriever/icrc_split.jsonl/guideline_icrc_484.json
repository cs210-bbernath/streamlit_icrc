If there are too many of them, a few should be selected to play the role of ''sentinels,'' or reporters. The rate of malnutrition should be monitored within the population, an important source of information, and not from the cases of malnutrition referred to the health-care facilities. # Data-Collecting Systems There are two ways of collecting data.
