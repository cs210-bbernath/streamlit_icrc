"to estimate a mean in the framework of a random sample of an infinite population. n = z 2 (x) SD 2 d 2 For a sample of n size, it is 95% certain that the value of the mean will fall between the established confidence limits. 2. Size of a sample to estimate a proportion 30 in the framework of a random sample for an infinite population. 27 These prerequisites are based on the following equation: the maximum value of the difference between the mean found in the sample and the true mean corresponds to the degree of precision established for the study. This value, d, is equal to z times the standard error (SE), or d = z (x) SE. The standard error is equal to the ratio between the standard deviation (SD) and the square root of the sample size (n), or SE = SD/Hn. Thus, d = z (x) SD/Hn n = z 2 (x)"
