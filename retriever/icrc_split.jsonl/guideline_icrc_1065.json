"a short, stout child; it requires accuracy in setting age, which is usually diffi cult to ensure; weight is infl uenced by variables that may alter the interpretation of results; weight is not always easily measured. # Conventional cut-off points and classifi cation: 9 > 90%: normal nutritional status 9 90 to 75%: mild malnutrition (fi rst degree) 9 < 75 to 61%: moderate malnutrition (second degree) 9 < 60%: severe malnutrition (third degree). # MUAC-for-height Advantages: a very good indicator of wasting; it provides a more accurate refl ection of the real nutritional reserves of the organism than weight (which explains its stronger correlation with mortality than with weight). According to circumstances and concurrent infection, overall weight loss is frequently proportionately lower than lean mass and adipose tissue loss (parasite infection, and sub-clinical infl ammation and oedema). Measuring brachial circumference amounts to measuring tissue that serves as nutritional reserves (i.e. lean mass and adipose tissue), and any variation in this circumference indicates variation in these tissues exclusively."
