"To sum up, before deciding to establish an MHU we have to ask ourselves eight questions (the following text is taken from the Handbook on War and Public Health, 15 with our comments in italics). # What is happening ? The raw data that flow in during a disaster are often imprecise and contradictory, and are certainly an inadequate basis for deciding whether action should be taken and, if so, in what form. The first requirement, then, is to make an initial assessment of the situation. Mobile health units are not an assessment strategy, for assessments generate too many expectations on the part of the population. It is important to have thorough knowledge of the various actors involved, as it is they who will make it possible to apply modes of action other than substitution. # What is important ? The initial assessment will bring into focus a set of problems, some of them more important than others. The task here is to identify the problems of highest priority."
