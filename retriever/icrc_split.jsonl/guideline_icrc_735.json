"by the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator. # Structure The DHA is run by an emergency relief coordinator appointed by the UN Secretary-General. Its seat is in New York and it maintains offices in Geneva. # Role The DHA's functions are to: . advise the Secretary-General on emergency situations; . reinforce the coordination of UN agency responses to emergencies; . mobilize the international community in cases of natural disaster. To direct this coordination, the DHA created an Inter-Agency Standing Committee. Other organizations, such as the ICRC and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, are represented on this Committee as observers. The DHA coordinates the financial appeals of the agencies. The ICRC, while invoking its independence and underlining the absolute necessity of making its own financial appeals, agrees to make its emergency appeals jointly with those of the DHA.
