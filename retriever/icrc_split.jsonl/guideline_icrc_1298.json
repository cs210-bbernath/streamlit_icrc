"total warehouse surface must exceed the occupied space by at least 25%, in order to afford enough space between the walls and the stocks, and in the aisles between food rows. 9 One tonne of food in 50 kg bags stacked in pairs in crossed layers makes a volume of roughly 2 cubic metres. Bags must not be stacked directly on the fl oor, but rather on pallets raised to at least 10 cm off the fl oor. Bags must not be stacked too high in order to prevent the stacks from collapsing, which can be dangerous. Different commodities must be stacked separately. 9 Damaged bags must be stored separately, and repacked as soon as possible if their contents can still be used. For instance: damp grain can be dried, and fl our contaminated by insects such as weevils can be sieved. If the food is damaged to the point of being unfi t for human consumption it should be disposed of by being buried, incinerated,"
