"easily, and this can lead to kidney and heart failure -manifesting itself in oedema and ultimately death. In such cases, it is tempting to increase protein supplies because kwashiorkor oedema is all too often ascribed to protein defi ciency, but this only worsens the situation. Hence the occasional reports of serious marasmus cases that developed kwashiorkor, and eventually died. In this particular case, oedema is totally unrelated to kwashiorkor, and results from kidney failure. This type of problem is possible if the P/E ratio of initial treatment feeding exceeds 6%. In the absence of ready-made F-75 Formula, alternatives prepared with basic ingredients include the following. # Improvised F-75 Formula F-75 Formula can easily be improvised in compliance with Table 13.5 above, from powdered milk, sugar, oil, cereal fl our, and special vitamin and mineral complements. 26 The difference lies in the use of cereal fl our instead of cereal starch -this increases the protein concentration, raising the P/E% to approximately 6.5%."
