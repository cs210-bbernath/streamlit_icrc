"filtration system (natural or engineered) - protect the area around the source from possible contamination - set up a water-distribution system - develop a drainage system for runoff - set up a maintenance and surveillance system Technological input includes sinking a well and constructing its walls or lining. There are four principal ways of sinking a well: . manual digging . mechanical digging . # manual drilling . mechanical drilling 20 The choice between these methods will depend on various factors, the importance of which varies from one situation to the next: # alternatives (other sources of water) . cost versus available funds # Technical Means for Extracting Water # Gravity Using gravity is the best way of drawing water, since it requires very little equipment. It can be used for some natural springs and for surface water (which can be diverted to a treatment unit). # Ancillary Means In developing countries, there are many local methods for drawing water from wells -for example,"
