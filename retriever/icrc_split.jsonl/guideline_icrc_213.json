"In a camp, the shelters are uniform, basic units lined up in rows; each family or group of families should have reasonably convenient access to latrines and water. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) recommends, for example, that latrines be available within a radius of 50 meters, and water within about 100 meters. 59 If necessary, the camp can be divided into zones according to different ethnic groups. Around each dwelling, a drainage system should be constructed for waste water and rain water. Precautions should also be taken against fire. # Organization of the Infrastructure The basic principle here is ''think big.'' Access roads must be passable all year and navigable by relief trucks. # VI. Evaluation of Water and Sanitation Programs First, the coverage of the programs set up must be evaluated. Coverage is reflected in such figures as the ratio between the number of people and the quantity of water available, and the ratio between the number of latrines and the total population."
