Select all children between 74 and 109 cm in height (i.e. roughly between 1 and 5 years old) for measurement. 2. Measure mid-upper arm circumference as described in Chapter X, Section 4.4.1. 3. Stand the child upright with its back fl at against the height scale. 4. Observations may be interpreted in two ways; they lead to the same result, but may cause confusion. q The child's actual mid-upper arm circumference is found on the left-hand scale (-2sd). If the child is shorter than the corresponding height indicated on the scale, the child is not wasted. If on the other hand, it is taller than the reference height for its MUAC, it is wasted, and the height corresponding to its MUAC value must be sought on the right-hand scale (-3sd). If the child is shorter than this reference, it is moderately wasted; if the child is taller,"
