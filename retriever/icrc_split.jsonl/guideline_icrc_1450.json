"can also be contaminated later by microbes that cause gastro-intestinal and respiratory infection, in addition to hepatitis, tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, and typhoid fever. Some of these microbes also produce toxins that may cause fatal poisoning. The water used for cooking and drinking can also contain such pathogens. Food can be contaminated by contact with dirty hands, insects, animals, dust, water, cooking utensils, previously contaminated kitchen benches and, clearly, other previously contaminated foods. Hands can be soiled through previous contact with food, clothing, objects, contaminated hair, or the use of sanitary facilities without subsequent washing. Pathogens multiply quickly in food, because the latter is their own food or culture medium. Multiplication is faster in food that is moist or contains elementary nutrients such as sugar, and in hot conditions. Strict food hygiene is therefore the pre-condition for the control of infectious disease. However, good food hygiene seldom arises from a scientifi c understanding of the connection between microscopic pathogens and infection."
