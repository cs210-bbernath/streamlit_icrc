"to adequate habitat conditions. # Economic rehabilitation This mode consists in restoring the means of production to the point of ensuring economic selfsuffi ciency at household level. Economic rehabilitation clearly only makes sense if the circumstances permit durable rehabilitation, that is, usually during the recovery phase following crisis. Economic rehabilitation should nevertheless be considered earlier also, in order to ensure a timely and comprehensive approach when circumstances permit. # Development Development seldom devolves on humanitarian agencies, at least in the sense of mitigating vulnerability to possible crisis. Those who analyse vulnerability must nevertheless inform relevant development agencies in order for the latter to devote the necessary attention to groups that have been affected by crisis. They must also see to it that rehabilitation programmes are followed by development initiatives that consolidate economic security. The action modes discussed above occur at different stages of the crisis process, and their intended effects correspond to the recovery levels indicated in Figure 9.3 opposite the different stages of the famine process."
