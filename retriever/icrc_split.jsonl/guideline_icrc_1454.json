"themes of Chapter XV -Nutritional information nutritional information 5.1 Food hygiene # Hygiene and food # Food storage and preservation Quality food storage is the fi rst stage of hygiene. Foodstuffs must be sheltered from rodents, birds, and insects; these can contaminate them directly, and/or open the way for additional contamination through the damage they cause. Foodstuffs must be sheltered from humidity, heat, and dust in order to avoid the spread of mould and bacteria, but also from light, which can likewise cause degradation. Storage space must be clean, closed but ventilated, easy to clean, and be sheltered from humidity and the elements. Cupboards, shelves protected by metal mesh (such as fi ne-meshed chicken wire), and suspended bags all offer good protection against insects and rodents. The food storage space must be treated against infestation regularly. Cats and mousetraps are also useful. Time must then be taken to inspect and supervise stocks and eliminate uninvited visitors and food commodities that have become unfi t for consumption."
