"cation amount to the sources of information that are used. Critical external factors are uncertainties that arise during the operation; those implementing the operation have little or no control over them, and their impact on its implementation and, thus, its success can be signifi cant. They amount to the various assumptions regarding developments in the situation, possible constraints, the risks involved in implementing the operation, and its possible negative side effects. Clearly, if the defi nition of critical external factors raises doubts as to its feasibility, then objectives have been set poorly. In such cases, the entire planning process must be revisited. # PLANNING ACTIVITIES AND RESOURCES Planning consists in defi ning what activities must be implemented, their precise combinations, in order to achieve specifi c objectives; it also sets their timing. This effort amounts to operational tactics, which must not be confused with the overall strategy. The strategy sets the combination and coordination of the different operational measures in order to achieve an overall objective;"
