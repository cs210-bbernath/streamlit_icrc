"cultivated as a sport. Not only does each agency want to be the best, but it must also get to the scene of action first! Some agencies are particularly attracted by competition, to the point where it may become their main objective. In this case, the victims' interests come second, which in the end results in interventions that are badly targeted, useless, or even dangerous for the beneficiaries. # Confrontation Not infrequently, agencies clash over intervention strategies or the line to take with local authorities. Confrontation is desirable except in the acute phases of operations, for it involves an exchange of opposing points of view which ultimately develops the approach to humanitarian situations. # Types of Relations between Humanitarian Agencies # Conflict A conflict between agencies is apt to ensue when there is confusion over their respective mandates. Of course, relations between agencies can move rapidly from one stage to another, depending on circumstances. Consultation favors coordination, whereas confusion may lead to conflict."
