"cash and kind, the logistics set-up (food transport, storage, and distribution), the purchase and hire of goods and services, and the recruitment of competent staff. # Obtaining means For donors to commit the necessary means for a GFD, they must be convinced of its relevance and approve the chosen approach. Persuasion is rather simple, provided that reliable and documented data is available to support the operation, that the justifi cation for the operation rests on its underlying humanitarian principles, that reporting is context-specifi c, and that donors deal with competent staff. In this respect, donors like to engage directly with fi eld staff in charge of assessments and distributions proper. Political parameters discourage some donors from supporting given operations; others on the contrary support them, even if they are not necessary. Here again, persuasion should be given adequate thought, on the basis of humanitarian and technical justifi cation. In such cases, it is best to rely on several donors with different interests, in order to preserve operational independence."
