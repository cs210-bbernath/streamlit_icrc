"indicators -are as follows: 9 mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC): 12.5 cm; 9 MUAC-for-height expressed as a percentage of the median: 75%; 9 MUAC-for-height expressed in Z-scores: -3 Z-scores; 9 weight-for-height expressed as a percentage of the median: 70%; 9 weight-for-height expressed in Z-scores: -3 Z-scores. Children rating less than these inferior thresholds must be referred to a therapeutic feeding centre, unless their health condition is still suffi ciently good for supplementary feeding alone to help their recovery. Moreover, the use of the above criteria must be combined with clinical assessment. If a child is clearly very ill and is likely to meet the admission criteria in the following days, it should in principle be accepted immediately, and be subjected to adequate healthcare. When targeting children under 5 years of age, attention must also be paid to their mothers' condition, especially when the child is younger than six months. Up to that age, if a child is malnourished, this is often an indication that the mother is malnourished herself,"
