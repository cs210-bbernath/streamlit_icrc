"bullet wounds, the extent of the lesion depends on the weight of the projectile, its stability, 46 the soundness of its construction, 47 its shape, and its velocity. 48 All these factors may combine to create particularly large lesions, due to the high transfer of energy. 49 Cavitation is produced, drawing debris and germs into the wound and causing additional lesions at some distance from the wound itself. # trunk # lower limbs Anti-personnel mine explosions cause localized injuries at foot and leg level; the location of bullet wounds is much more variable. # Extent of Needs In disaster and conflict situations, it is impossible to predict the number of wounded who will require care. 46 The bullet may go through various movements in the course of its trajectory: oscillations around its longitudinal axis, rotation, etc. 47 Bullets that fragment on impact cause more extensive lesions than bullets that remain intact. 48 A distinction is made between high-velocity bullets (800 m/s) and low-velocity bullets (150-200 m/s). The greater the velocity,"
