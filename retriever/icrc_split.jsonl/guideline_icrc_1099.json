"produced easily (should they be unavailable or to suit specifi c purposes) by using a compass and a speedometer mile count, or any other more or less artisanal method. Transects show the main sub-areas according to land use within an overall area, according to the most relevant section. They are particularly useful in identifying critical spots and in describing individual ecosystems and agricultural systems (McCracken, 1988). Figure 10.16 below provides an example of transect for an African village. # Seasonal calendars Seasonal calendars are useful in rural environments where production varies throughout the year. They can refl ect all signifi cant events occurring during the year. Seasonal calendars should ideally be established for a period of 18 months, in order to refl ect seasonal cross-over periods. Calendar design is usually based on a normal year, thus facilitating the subsequent deduction of deviances observed during assessment. Whatever the ultimate approach, calendars must indicate the reference year."
