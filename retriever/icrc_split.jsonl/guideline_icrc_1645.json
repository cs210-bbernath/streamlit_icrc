"the outset. If malnutrition has multiple causes, it can for example be implemented fi rst within feeding centres and healthcare facilities; if it is successful, its extension can then be attempted. It may nevertheless be best to target the entire community from the outset if poor practice appears to be general and is feared to have serious consequences. The ultimate decision should be circumstantial, based on constraints and opportunities. The extension of the programme to the entire community may seem complicated at fi rst, especially in terms of access. It need not be however, because nutritional information always combines with assistance operations, and these require broad-based and regular contact with target groups. If this contact provides the entry point for nutritional information, dialogue and participatory approaches necessarily follow, this time in relation to issues of culture and living conditions -these contacts also produce much additional information and strengthen informal interaction by addressing issues that are only of indirect economic relevance."
