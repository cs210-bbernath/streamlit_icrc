"made operational immediately. The roads giving access to the hospital should be cleared to allow ambulances to pass. # Preparing the Personnel The staff's duties in a situation of incoming casualties must be clearly defined in advance, so that no time is lost when the moment comes. The chief surgeon's job is to revise the operating schedule and to free beds occupied by patients who can be moved to other wards or facilities; the head nurse is usually responsible for supervising the preparation of equipment such as blood units, drugs, surgical supplies, etc. All the surgical staff should be in position, ready to assume the duties assigned to them. If preliminary information received from the triage team warrants it, reinforcements may be requested (off-duty personnel). # Preparing the Equipment Every surgical unit should have emergency reserves permitting it to cope with large numbers of casualties, at least for a few days. This equipment must be prepared in advance, so that each type of item is immediately available."
