"here we will merely touch on the most visible problems for which rehabilitation solutions exist. # Seeds Lack of seeds may prevent the resumption of farming. In this case, the distribution of seeds suitable for local conditions is enough to re-establish agricultural production. # Cattle In very serious crises, draft animals may have been slaughtered or sold in order to buy food. Replacing the cattle helps get agricultural activity restarted. 76 This is the recognized chronic aid recipients' syndrome, in which beneficiaries come to expect humanitarian organizations to guarantee them long-term food aid. 77 Article 14 of Protocol II additional to the Geneva Conventions provides a basis in law for this kind of protection.

Warfare disrupts the operation of local services, including veterinary services."
