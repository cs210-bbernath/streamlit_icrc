"to attribute population percentages to each wealth group. Paired ranking (sometimes called pairwise ranking) is also a useful method to defi ne preferences or priorities. For instance, to determine the importance of food sources (i.e. the item) informants are asked to indicate which sources they rely on. These different items (in this case sources), are then entered in the rows and columns of a matrix; the heading of column 1 is identical to that of row 1, that of column 2 is identical to that of column 2, and so on. Items are then compared to one another once, and informants asked to state their preference; for example, \"do you prefer item 1 or item 2?\", or \"which is more important: source 1 or source 2?\". The answer is then recorded in the corresponding box. The item, or source, that most frequently provides the answer is the most important (i.e. it has the highest priority); this permits the ranking of all items or sources by order of importance."
