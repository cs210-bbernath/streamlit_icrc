"can be determined as follows: ''The correlation coefficient is multiplied by the square root of the number of pairs and, if the product is greater than 2, the correlation coefficient can be considered significant at the 5% threshold.'' 45 # Analysis of the Variance The test of the F variance compares the results of several sets of data by examining the relation of the variability between the sets of measures and the variability within each of these sets. There are tables (Fisher & Yates) for calculating the value of F for various degrees of freedom. . 44 The formula for calculating the coefficient of correlation is: r = S (X -Xm) (Y -Ym) H S (X -Xm) 2 S (Y -Ym) 2 45 A.

Nevertheless, a critical analysis of results is essential,"
