"be mild between 5 and 19.9%, moderate between 20 and 30%, and serious above 30%. However, even mild rates demand blanket intervention, because of the serious consequences of iodine defi ciency. Goitre may develop in adults and children alike, but in areas where it is endemic, its development clearly begins in childhood. The greatest prevalence rates are observed in adolescents, and they are greater in girls than in boys. Goitre itself is not painful, but is disturbing because it is a deformation that can become ugly, and even uncomfortable by exerting pressure on the trachea and the oesophagus; this may impede breathing, cause coughing through irritation, alter the voice, and impair swallowing.
