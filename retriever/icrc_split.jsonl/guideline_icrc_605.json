However, they also provide an opportunity to genuinely reform and improve the health system, because they encourage such changes as better distribution of services or a shift from large hospitals to comprehensive and decentralized health services. Such measures were adopted in Mexico City during the reconstruction of the hospitals destroyed by the earthquake.'' 51 # Floods Here again, the connection with underdevelopment is obvious: populations concentrated in fertile but high-risk areas, absence of dams or dikes to hold back flood waters, flimsy housing which will not stand up to flooding. Environmental vulnerability could conceivably be reduced, through reforestation and the construction of dams and water reservoirs. Such projects are realistic only if the community agrees they are justified and is willing to maintain them in the long term. # Volcanoes The vulnerability associated with volcanoes is not limited to actual eruptions,"
