"are therefore usually the following: 9 a main source of energy, usually cereals which also supplies a substantial amount of protein and micro-nutrients; 9 a concentrated source of protein, usually legumes, which provides both energy and micro-nutrients; 9 a concentrated source of energy in the form of vegetable oil or fat. These three types of foods must be balanced, with an acceptable variation in the order of \u00b15% that is usually determined by logistical constraints at distribution level. # The lipid energy/overall energy ratio According to different recommended intakes, the contribution of lipids should represent 10 to 20% of the overall calorie supply; only de Ville de Goyet recommends 20-40% (de Ville de Goyet, 1978). Oil is included in food rations because it is a concentrated source of energy and is essential in some cooking methods; it also enhances fl avour. This concentrated source of energy contributes especially to increasing the energy density of the diet of infants, and is evidently important in nutritional rehabilitation. Moreover,"
