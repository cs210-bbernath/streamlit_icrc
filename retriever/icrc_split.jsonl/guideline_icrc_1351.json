"water. # Treating dehydration Diarrhoea that combines with severe malnutrition causes substantial electrolyte and mineral imbalance; its treatment is therefore different from that recommended for diarrhoea that is unrelated to malnutrition. 1. In case of marasmus, the sodium pump activity slows down. This results in excess sodium and potassium defi ciency in the cell, and potassium is excreted. This logically causes hyponatraemia. 2. In case of kwashiorkor, the sodium pump activity is faster than in healthy subjects. However, this does not prevent the increase of intra-cellular sodium and potassium loss, because membranes become abnormally permeable to these two ions. Moreover, extra-cellular sodium also increases, causing substantial sodium excess (Briend, 1997). 3. The tissue concentration of major minerals drops (zinc, copper, manganese, and magnesium, among others). They are lost at the same time as the cell reduces its metabolic activity, leading to a reduction in its components (Golden, 1982). 4. Zinc, magnesium, and copper defi ciencies can themselves cause diarrhoea ."
