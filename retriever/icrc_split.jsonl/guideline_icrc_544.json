"of the capacity and accessibility of the local services. 23 # Starting Point for the Flow Chart Take as a starting point the criterion of accessibility, and answer the question: Are the local services accessible to the victims? YES/NO YES: Move to the next criterion -> YES: capacities of the local services NO: Why not? a) Physical or geographical inaccessibility: The health-care services are too far away from the displaced population; there are no means of transport. This kind of problem is not specific to emergency situations; rural populations are usually very far away from health-care facilities. b) Financial inaccessibility: Civilians wounded in the course of a conflict, for example, may not have the money to pay the hospital, even though the latter has the capacity to treat them. c) Social inaccessibility: This may be exacerbated by the increased demand during a crisis; the most deprived social classes may be denied access to healthcare facilities. d) Political inaccessibility: This is very specific to conflict situations."
