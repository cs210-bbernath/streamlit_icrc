According to the type of mill and local eating habits, milling itself causes 10 to 20% losses or more, and also involves substantial vitamin, protein, and mineral loss. 23 The cost of milling on the other hand is determined by supply and demand; crises involving considerable population concentrations can raise demand signifi cantly and, thus, result in price increases (up to one-third of the milled product).

Its handling entails fewer losses, and grain is more easily assembled and repacked if its bags are damaged; it is also cheaper than fl our.
