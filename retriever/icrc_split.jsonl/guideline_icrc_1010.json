"pilot study in the fi eld that detects groups that may differ from one another with respect to the variable under scrutiny. Pilot studies can also serve to estimate the prevalence rate of a given variable, if the latter is to be measured later by sampling. In case of doubt as to homogeneity, different sampling methods may be used. # Probability sampling All individuals in the group must have equal probabilities of being selected for inclusion in the sample. This requires the use of random selection and a fair understanding of the group (or population) under scrutiny. Selection methods are determined by the sampling method, which is infl uenced by the accuracy of sampling, and by constraints of time, resources, and access. # Accuracy The accuracy of the result is determined by the size of the sample, which is set mainly by the sampling method. # Simple random sampling This is statistically the most orthodox method in terms of random selection. Theoretically, this method requires the availability of lists (e.g."
