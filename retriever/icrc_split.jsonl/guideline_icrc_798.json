"and a precursor of niacin. Tryptophan can contribute substantially to niacin intake, provided it is excessive with respect to protein requirements and the amino-acid homeostasis. Pellagra is usually related to defi ciency in ribofl avin and vitamin B 6 (pyridoxine), which contribute to the conversion of tryptophan into niacin. Furthermore, anaemia always concurs with pellagra. Consequently, pellagra is considered as resulting from a multiple defi ciency, rather than from niacin defi ciency alone. Pellagra is associated with diets whose protein supply (and, hence, the energy supply) is accounted for by maize, mainly. It spread in Europe with the introduction of maize, which frequently superseded traditional and secondary cereals because its yield is higher and the plant is better protected against pests (particularly birds). Unfortunately, the nutritional value of maize is lower than that of other cereals, particularly because its protein is of inferior quality (poor in tryptophan), and because its niacin content is mainly in a form that is biologically unusable. As a result,"
